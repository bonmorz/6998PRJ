When light passes through a transparent medium, such as glass or water, it changes speed and direction, causing the light to bend. This bending of light is what allows us to see objects, and it is also what causes objects to appear differently when we look at them through different media. Option (D) is the correct answer because when we look at pickles in a jar, the bending of light due to refraction can make them appear bigger or distorted in some way. Options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because they do not provide examples of refraction."
