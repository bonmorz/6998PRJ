Option (D) is the correct answer because closing the bedroom blinds would block the UV rays from entering the room and reaching the person's skin. Option (A) is incorrect because gathering seashells at the beach does not necessarily protect the person from UV rays. Option (B) is incorrect because sunbathing in their yard would expose the person to UV rays. Option (C) is also incorrect because digging a trench outdoors does not necessarily protect the person from UV rays."
