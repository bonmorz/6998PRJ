Option (B) is the correct answer because horses, like humans, have a circulatory system that circulates blood throughout their body to transport oxygen and nutrients. Option (A) is incorrect because trees do not have a circulatory system - they have a transport system called xylem and phloem. Option (C) is incorrect because cars do not have circulatory systems - they have fuel and coolant systems. Option (D) is incorrect because rocks do not have living systems and therefore do not have circulatory systems."
