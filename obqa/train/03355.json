Corn is a plant, and plants produce nutrients through the process of photosynthesis. These nutrients are then consumed by other organisms. Among the options, only a raven, which is an animal, can benefit from the nutrients provided by corn. Rocks, ice, and waterfalls are non-living entities and do not require or benefit from nutrients."
