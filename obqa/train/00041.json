Vegetable oil is considered a renewable fuel source because it can be produced from crops, such as soybeans or canola, which can be grown and replenished. Coal, fossil fuel, and petroleum fuel are all non-renewable sources of energy because they are formed from ancient organic materials that take millions of years to replenish. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. Option (B), coal, is a non-renewable fuel source. Option (C), fossil fuel, is a general term that includes coal, oil, and natural gas, all of which are non-renewable. Option (D), petroleum fuel, refers specifically to oil, which is also a non-renewable resource."

Option (B), coal, is incorrect because it is a non-renewable fuel source that is formed from the remains of ancient plants. Option (C), fossil fuel, is also incorrect because it refers to non-renewable sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Option (D), petroleum fuel, is not a specific enough term to determine if it is renewable or non-renewable, but in general, petroleum is a non-renewable resource."
