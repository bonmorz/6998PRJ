Volatile substances are those that easily evaporate or vaporize at normal temperatures. When volatile ingredients are combined, the molecular bonds holding them together are disrupted, causing them to separate. Option (A) is incorrect because ice does not typically break molecular bonds. Option (C) is incorrect because soap and water do not break molecular bonds, but rather help to weaken the forces holding dirt and bacteria to surfaces. Option (D) is too broad and vague, as force itself does not specifically break molecular bonds."
