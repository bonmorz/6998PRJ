The roots of a tree are responsible for anchoring the tree into the ground and providing stability. By using a strong foundation and sturdy support system, like the roots of a tree, one can make a house more resilient and stable. The leaves, pine cones, and fruits of a tree do not provide the same structural support as the roots, so they would not be suitable for this purpose."
