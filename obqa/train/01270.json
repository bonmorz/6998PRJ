When an iron horseshoe is held over a paperclip, the horseshoe acts as a magnet and attracts the paperclip towards it. Option (A) is incorrect because holding an iron horseshoe over a paperclip will not cause it to melt. Option (B) is incorrect because the magnetism will cause the paperclip to be pulled towards the horseshoe, not dropped. Option (C) is incorrect because there is no burning involved in this scenario. Option (D) is the correct answer because the horseshoe will yank or pull the paperclip towards it due to magnetic attraction."
