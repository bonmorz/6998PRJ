White blood cells, specifically lymphocytes, help to defend the body against foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites. They do this by recognizing and destroying these harmful substances. Option (A), (C), and (D) are all incorrect as white blood cells work to eliminate these pathogens from the body. Option (B) is correct because white blood cells do not target or eliminate oxygen, as it is essential for bodily functions."

White blood cells are responsible for defending the body against foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites. They recognize and eliminate these harmful organisms from the body. Therefore, options (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect because white blood cells do not allow viruses, parasites, or bacteria to stay in the body. The only option left is (B) oxygen, which is a necessary component for normal cellular function and is not harmful to the body. White blood cells do not eliminate or attack oxygen molecules, so it can be said that they allow oxygen to stay in the body."
