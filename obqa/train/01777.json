Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, primarily in the leaves. In order for photosynthesis to occur, the leaves need to be exposed to sunlight. Option (A) states that when a plant spreads out its leaves flat, it allows for maximum surface area exposed to sunlight, thus enabling better photosynthesis. Options (B), (C), and (D) would likely hinder photosynthesis, as they involve damage or deformation to the leaves."
