Dogs have a highly developed sense of smell, known as olfaction, which is often used for hunting. They can sense and track scents of other animals or objects using their olfactory system. Option (A) is incorrect because dogs cannot sense whales, as whales are marine animals and not typically found in the same environment as dogs. Option (B) is also incorrect because while dogs might be interested in toys, it is not directly related to their hunting behavior. Option (C) is unrelated because being tired does not determine a dog's ability to sense something using its olfactory system."
