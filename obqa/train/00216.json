The question states that the son-in-law was required to add rugs or carpeting to his upstairs apartment while the ground floor was not. We need to consider the reasons behind this requirement. \n\nOption (A) suggests that the reason was to make the apartment look good for prospective renters. While this may be a valid reason in some cases, it does not explain why it was specifically required for the upstairs apartment and not the ground floor. Therefore, option (A) is not the correct answer.\n\nOption (B) states that the requirement was to prevent the son-in-law from scratching the wood floors. Although this could be a consideration, it does not explain why the ground floor was exempt from this requirement. This option does not provide a satisfactory explanation, so it is not the correct answer.\n\nOption (C), on the other hand, suggests that the requirement was intended to minimize noise complaints from the downstairs renters. Adding rugs or carpeting to the upstairs apartment can help dampen sound and reduce the impact of footsteps and other noises that may disturb the tenants below. This option provides a plausible explanation for why the ground floor was not required to have rugs or carpeting, as they would not have tenants below them to potentially complain about noise. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer.\n\nOption (D) suggests that the requirement was imposed to avoid the cost of carpeting by shifting the responsibility to the son-in-law. While this could be a factor, it does not address why the upstairs apartment specifically needed rugs or carpeting while the ground floor did not. This option does not provide a complete explanation, so it is not the correct answer.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is option (C) because it provides the most plausible explanation for why the son-in-law was required to add rugs or carpeting to his upstairs apartment while the ground floor was not."

Option (B) is not a valid reason because if there were concerns about the son-in-law scratching the wood floors, they could simply ask him to be cautious or provide alternative solutions such as floor protectors. Option (D) is also not a likely explanation because if the ground floor apartment did not require carpeting, it suggests that the property owners were willing to invest in flooring.
