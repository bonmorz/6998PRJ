Seed dispersal refers to the movement of seeds away from the parent plant to new locations. This benefits the production of plant offspring because it helps to prevent overcrowding, competition for resources, and inbreeding.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because seed dispersal does not directly benefit the production of human offspring. Option (B) is incorrect because seed dispersal actually increases the production of new plants by allowing seeds to reach new locations and germinate. Option (C) is incorrect because seed dispersal plays a crucial role in plant reproduction by helping to ensure that seeds are spread away from the parent plant.

Seed dispersal refers to the scattering or spreading of seeds away from the parent plant. This process is crucial for plant reproduction and allows plants to colonize new habitats and avoid competition with their parent plant.
