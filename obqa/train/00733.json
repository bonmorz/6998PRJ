They develop from the ovary of a flower, which is fertilized by pollen to produce a seed. The fruit then develops around the seed, providing protection and aiding in seed dispersal. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer because a fruit was once a reproductive structure of a plant. Option (A) is incorrect because fruits are a distinct part of a plant. Option (C) is incorrect because stones are typically found within some fruits, such as a cherry or peach, but they are not the same thing as a fruit. Option (D) is incorrect because roots and fruits are different plant structures with different functions."
