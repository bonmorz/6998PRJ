The best time to have an all-day BBQ in the northern hemisphere is at the end of June, around the summer solstice.

Option (A) and (B) are incorrect because December 21st and the winter solstice mark the shortest days of the year with less daylight.

The end of June, specifically around June 21st, is the summer solstice. During this time, the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, resulting in longer daylight hours and generally warmer temperatures. This makes it the ideal time for an all-day BBQ because there is more sunlight and the weather is warmer. Options (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect because they are either in the winter months or not during the time of the year when the northern hemisphere receives the most sunlight."
