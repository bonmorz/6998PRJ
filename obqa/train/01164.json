Leaves are the main organs responsible for photosynthesis in plants. Photosynthesis occurs in specialized compartments within the leaf called chloroplasts. These chloroplasts contain pigments that capture sunlight and convert it into energy for the plant. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) specialized compartment. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because roots are not typically found in leaves. Option (B) is incorrect because buds are usually found in other parts of the plant, such as stems, and are not directly related to the function of leaves.
