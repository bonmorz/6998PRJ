Option (A) states that the puppy's mother had ears that looked the same way, which could suggest that the trait is inherited. Floppy ears in dogs can be a genetic trait, and offspring often inherit physical characteristics from their parents. Therefore, it is possible that the puppy's floppy ears are a result of genetics, passed down from its mother. \n\nOption (B) suggests that the puppy is deaf, which is unrelated to the appearance of its ears. Option (C) states that the puppy is tired, which has no correlation with the structure of its ears. Option (D) suggests that the puppy is missing the bones in its ears, which is not a common condition and is unlikely to be the cause of floppy ears."

Option (D) states that the puppy is missing the bones in its ears, which is anatomically incorrect.\n\nUpon examining option (A), we find a plausible explanation. It is possible that the puppy's floppy ears are the result of genetics and inheriting the trait from its mother. If the puppy's mother also had floppy ears, there is a higher likelihood that the puppy would also have floppy ears. This is because physical traits are often passed down from parents to offspring through genes. Floppy ears in puppies can be a result of specific alleles that control ear cartilage development.
