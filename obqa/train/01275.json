During this time, they do not sleep in the same way that humans or animals with regular sleep patterns do. Instead, they remain inactive and conserve energy by reducing their metabolic rate. Option (A) is incorrect because bumble bees do not sleep for years. Option (B) is incorrect because \"sleeping softly\" is not a behavior exhibited by bumble bees.
