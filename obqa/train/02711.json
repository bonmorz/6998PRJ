Crustaceans are aquatic organisms and are more likely to be found in limestone, which is formed from the accumulation of the remains of marine organisms. Magma, on the other hand, is molten rock and unlikely to preserve ancient crustaceans. Option (A) is incorrect because crustaceans are not typically found in magma.
