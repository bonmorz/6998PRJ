Option (B) is the least likely to help someone with bad vision because sungazing can actually be harmful to the eyes. Staring directly at the sun can cause damage to the retina and other structures of the eye. Option (A) is likely to help someone with bad vision because a magnifying glass can make objects appear larger and easier to see. Option (C) and Option (D) are also likely to help because binoculars and telescopes can magnify objects and bring them closer, making them easier to see."
