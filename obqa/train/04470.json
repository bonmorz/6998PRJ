Magma, which is molten rock found beneath the Earth's surface, plays a key role in mountain formation. As the magma rises to the surface and cools, it hardens and forms rock structures that eventually become mountains. \n\nOption (A), venom, is unrelated to mountain formation and is often associated with animals or plants. Option (B), peat, is partially decomposed plant material and is found in wetlands. While it can contribute to the formation of peat mountains, it is not directly related to the birth of typical mountains. Option (D), sunlight, is necessary for various processes on Earth but is not directly involved in mountain formation."

Mountains are generally formed through tectonic processes, specifically through the movement and collision of Earth's tectonic plates. When tectonic plates converge, one plate may be forced beneath the other, causing intense pressure and heat. This can lead to the melting of rocks and the creation of magma. The magma then rises toward the surface and eventually cools and solidifies, forming the core of a mountain. Therefore, the substance likely present for the birth of a mountain is magma. Options (A), (B), and (D) are unrelated to mountain formation."
