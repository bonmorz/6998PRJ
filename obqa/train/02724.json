This is because tree rings, also known as growth rings, can provide valuable information about a tree's age. Each year, a tree grows a new layer of wood around its trunk, creating a distinct ring. By counting the number of rings, experts can estimate the age of the tree. Option (A) is incorrect because simply thinking about the tree will not provide any information about its age. Option (B) is also incorrect because burying the tree would not reveal any information about its age. Option (C) may provide some clues about the tree's health and species, but it would not provide an accurate estimate of its age. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer."
