Octopuses are known for their ability to camouflage themselves by changing their color and texture to match their surroundings. Option (B) states that emulating a rock is a way for an octopus to evade predators, which is correct. Option (A) is incorrect because an octopus is unlikely to befriend its predators. Option (C) is too vague and does not provide a specific defense mechanism. Option (D) is also incorrect because octopuses live in water and not underground."
