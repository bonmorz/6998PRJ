Polar bears are white in order to blend in with the snow and ice in their habitat. This is an inherited characteristic that has evolved over time to help polar bears with hunting and survival. Option (B) is incorrect because the coat of polar bears is white due to their inherited characteristic. Option (C) is incorrect because although the snow is white, polar bears are not white because of the snow itself, but rather to blend in with the snow. Option (D) is also incorrect because the length of their fur does not determine their whiteness."
