When two objects have the same charge, they will repel each other, or in other words, push away from each other. This is because objects with the same charge have an excess of either positive or negative charges, creating a repulsive force between them. Options (A) and (B) are incorrect because they imply a protective response or a movement towards each other, which is not the case when two objects have the same charge. Option (C) is also incorrect because it implies a movement towards each other, which is not observed in objects with the same charge."
