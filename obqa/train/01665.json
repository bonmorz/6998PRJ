Option (C), planted flowers on a bright, clear day, is correct because it represents a situation where there is ample sunlight for the plants to absorb and convert into energy. Option (A) is incorrect because the moonlight does not provide the same intensity of solar energy as sunlight. Option (B) is incorrect because potted flowers in a windowless room would not receive sunlight and therefore cannot absorb solar energy. Option (D) is incorrect because although seeds do need sunlight to germinate and sprout, they do not directly absorb solar energy."
