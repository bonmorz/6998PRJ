Drinking polluted water can be harmful to human health because it may contain contaminants such as bacteria, viruses, chemicals, or heavy metals. Option (A) is the correct answer because consuming substances like bacteria or chemicals can have toxic effects on the body, similar to drinking poison. Option (B) is incorrect because rocks are not typically found in polluted water and they would not have the same health risks. Option (C) is incorrect because air, while it may have its own pollutants, is not typically present in water for drinking. Option (D) is incorrect because solids, while they may indicate pollution, do not necessarily pose the same health risks as consuming toxins or contaminants."
