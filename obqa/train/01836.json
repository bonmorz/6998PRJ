Steve's ears would not be responsible for the taste of his lunch (option A), as taste is detected by the taste buds on the tongue. The light streaming through the window (option C) would be detected by the eyes, not the ears. The feeling of his hair on his neck (option D) would be detected by tactile receptors in the skin, not the ears. Option B, waves in the air, is correct because sound waves travel through the air and are detected by the ears. Steve's ears would alert him to any sounds in the environment."

Option (C) is incorrect because the light streaming through the window would be perceived by his eyes, not his ears. Option (D) is incorrect because the feeling of his hair on his neck would be sensed by his sense of touch, not his ears.\n\nOption (B) is the correct answer because waves in the air can be perceived by the ears as sound.
