When a tree is growing in an area that is most ideal to it, the soil will be loose. Loose soil has a good balance of air, water, and nutrients, which allows roots to grow and penetrate it easily. Firm soil (option A) may indicate that the dirt is compacted and has poor drainage, making it less ideal for tree growth. Packed tight soil (option C) may indicate that the dirt is too compact and lacks proper aeration for root growth. Airless soil (option D) would be detrimental to plant growth as roots require oxygen for respiration."
