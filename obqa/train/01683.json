The octopus has the ability to release a cloud of ink when it feels threatened. This ink acts as a distraction, allowing the octopus to escape from predators.

The correct answer is (A) its ink. \nOctopuses have a unique defense mechanism where they release a cloud of ink to distract and confuse predators. This ink is produced by special glands in their body and when threatened, the octopus releases the ink, creating a dark cloud in the water. This cloud helps to obscure the octopus's movements, making it harder for the predator to locate and capture the octopus. Option (B) flying is incorrect because octopuses do not have wings and cannot fly. Option (C) yelling is not a defense mechanism of the octopus as they do not have vocal cords. Option (D) crying is also incorrect as crying is not a defense mechanism in animals."
