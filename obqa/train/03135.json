When a switch is flipped to turn on a light bulb, the filament inside the glass container heats up and begins to glow, producing light. Option (A) is incorrect because the filament glows and produces light, so it is not dark. Option (C) and (D) are also incorrect because they describe conditions that are opposite to the heating effect of the filament. Option (B) is correct because when the filament heats up, it becomes toasty, emitting light and heat."
