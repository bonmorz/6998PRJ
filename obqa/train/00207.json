When water is exposed to air, it will begin to evaporate, starting with the water with the largest surface area. In this scenario, water in the mug is likely to have a larger surface area compared to the water on the tray, plate, or table. Therefore, the water in the mug would evaporate before the water on the tray, plate, or table.
