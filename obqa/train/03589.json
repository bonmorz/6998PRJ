Many fawns are born in the spring and their fur coloration changes as they grow. In autumn, their fur often takes on shades of brown and tan, which helps them camouflage with the fallen leaves and vegetation in their environment. Options (B) and (C) are incorrect because fawns are typically found in forested areas and not in oceans or icy lakes. Option (D) is incorrect because winter landscapes are often covered in snow, which would not provide effective camouflage for a fawn with brown and tan fur."
