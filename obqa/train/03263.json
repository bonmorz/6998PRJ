The lungs are responsible for the exchange of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) between the air and the bloodstream.

Option (B) is incorrect because the lungs do not directly give oxygen to neighbors. Option (C) is incorrect because the lungs do not give oxygen to the ozone layer. Option (D) is incorrect because the lungs do not give oxygen to the poor, but rather to the body as a whole."
