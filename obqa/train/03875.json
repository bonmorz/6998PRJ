A turbine is a device that converts the energy of a moving fluid (such as air or water) into mechanical energy. In this context, a turbine is the most appropriate option because it can generate sustainable energy for a long period of time. Option (A) is incorrect because a car battery would only provide energy for a limited time before needing to be recharged. Option (B) is incorrect because a loaf of bread is consumed and does not provide long-term energy. Option (D) is incorrect because a tank of gas would need to be refilled multiple times and does not provide energy for a whole lifetime."
