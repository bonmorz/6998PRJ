When a sound is produced inside a room, there can be a delayed reflection, also known as an echo. This is when the sound waves bounce off the walls, floor, and ceiling of the room, causing a second, fainter sound to be heard after the initial sound. Option (A) is incorrect because light is not related to the production of sound. Option (B) is also incorrect because an electric charge is not a typical result of producing a sound. Option (D) is unrelated to sound production and refers to a video, which is a visual medium."
