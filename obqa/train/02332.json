It seems to be a combination of sexual and asexual reproduction, but since it is not a defined concept, it would be excluded from a list of forms of reproduction.\n\n(C) Asexual reproduction is a mode of reproduction where offspring are produced without the involvement of gametes (sex cells) or fusion of genetic material from two parents.
