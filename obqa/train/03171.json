Since the bear is white, it would be most advantageous for it if the space, or habitat, matches its fur color. This would provide camouflage and help the bear blend in with its surroundings, increasing its chances of survival. Option (B) is incorrect because a warm climate may not necessarily be ideal for a white bear, which thrives in colder climates. Option (C) is incorrect because a dark and humid environment is more suitable for species that prefer shade and moisture, rather than a white bear. Option (D) is also incorrect because a green and leafy environment does not necessarily provide the best camouflage for a white bear, which would stand out more against the greenery."
