This adaptation helps them survive the cold temperatures. Option (A) is incorrect because migration is a different behavior related to birds moving from one region to another in search of better conditions or food sources. Option (C) is incorrect because while some birds may die in cold climates due to the harsh conditions, this is not the primary way they cope with the cold.
