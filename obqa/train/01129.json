Sound waves are created by vibrating objects, and they travel through the air or other mediums to reach our ears. Option (B) is the correct answer because moving pots and pans can create vibrations that produce sound waves. Option (A) is unrelated to sound and more related to the action of eating. Option (C) may produce some sound if it is moved in a way that creates vibrations, but it is not directly related to hearing sound. Option (D) is unrelated to sound as well."
