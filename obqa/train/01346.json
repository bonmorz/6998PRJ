Daylight, which is produced by the sun, provides the light energy necessary for photosynthesis in plants. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into usable energy, and it is the foundation of the food chain on Earth. All forms of life, directly or indirectly, rely on this process for their growth and sustenance. Option (A) is incorrect because there is no scientific evidence for the existence of solar aliens. Options (B) and (C) are fictional concepts and not supported by scientific understanding."
