Instinctive behavior refers to a behavior that an animal is born with and does not need to learn. Freshly hatched turtles seeking water is an example of instinctive behavior because they instinctively know that they need to seek water after hatching. Option (B) is incorrect because birds being trained to play games implies that they are learning the behavior, not exhibiting instinct. Option (C) is unrelated to instinctive behavior as it refers to cats being fed salami, which is a specific action influenced by external factors. Option (D) is also unrelated to instinctive behavior as it refers to dogs riding in cars, which is a learned behavior and not instinctive."

Instinctive behavior refers to behaviors that are genetically programmed and do not require learning or experience. Option (A) is the correct answer because freshly hatched turtles seek water immediately after hatching without any prior knowledge or training. They instinctively know that they need to make their way to water. Option (B) is incorrect because birds being trained to play games suggests that they are learning the behavior, rather than demonstrating instinct. Option (C) is incorrect because cats being fed salami is a learned behavior, not instinctive. Option (D) is also incorrect because dogs riding in cars is a learned behavior, not instinctive."
