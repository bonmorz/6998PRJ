Option (A) states that without global warming, most days would be hotter. However, global warming refers to an increase in average global temperatures, so it is unlikely that most days would be hotter without it. Option (B) suggests that without underground water reservoirs, most days would be hotter. While water does play a role in regulating temperature, underground water reservoirs alone would not have a significant impact on daily temperatures. Option (C) states that without the sun, most days would be hotter. This is incorrect because without the sun, the Earth would not receive any heat or light, resulting in much colder temperatures. Option (D) claims that without the ocean, most days would be hotter. This is the most accurate statement out of the options provided. The ocean plays a crucial role in regulating temperatures by absorbing and storing heat, as well as influencing weather patterns. Without the ocean, there would be a significant loss of heat absorption, leading to hotter days overall."

Without the ocean, there would be a lack of this heat absorption and redistribution, resulting in hotter and more extreme weather conditions.
