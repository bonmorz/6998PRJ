Sunburn occurs when the skin is exposed to the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation for an extended period of time. In a desert environment, there is typically very little shade or vegetation to provide protection from the sun's rays. Therefore, spending a long time hiking in a desert without proper sun protection (such as sunscreen and protective clothing) increases the likelihood of getting a sunburn. Options (B), (C), and (D) are less likely to cause sunburn because forests, wetlands, and jungles often have more shade and vegetation to block some of the sun's rays."

A sunburn is most likely to happen when there is prolonged exposure to the sun's rays without proper protection.

While there may be shade from the dense vegetation, there are still areas where direct sunlight reaches the skin, increasing the risk of a sunburn.\n\nIn conclusion, hiking in a desert (option A) is the most likely scenario to result in a sunburn due to the intense and prolonged exposure to direct sunlight."
