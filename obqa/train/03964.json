First, we know that asteroids do not have an atmosphere, so there is no wind or weathering that would erode the prints. Additionally, there are no living organisms on the asteroid that could disturb or degrade the prints.\n\nHowever, over a long period of time, there are a few factors that could cause the boot prints to eventually fade away. One factor is micrometeorite impacts. These small meteoroids can collide with the surface of the asteroid and cause small disturbances, potentially covering up or erasing the boot prints.\n\nAnother factor is the thermal cycling of the asteroid. As the asteroid orbits the sun, it will experience fluctuating temperatures. These temperature changes can cause the surface material of the asteroid to expand and contract, which could smooth out any disturbances in the surface, including the boot prints.\n\nGiven these factors, it is reasonable to assume that the boot prints could last for thousands of years on the asteroid. Option (C) is the correct answer. Options (A) and (D) are too short of a time period, and option (B) is possible but less likely than thousands of years."

While the specific answer can vary depending on various factors, the most accurate estimate is that the boot prints could potentially last for thousands of years.\n\nAsteroids typically do not have an atmosphere or weather patterns like Earth, which means there is no wind or rain to erode or wash away the boot prints. Additionally, there is no biological activity on asteroids that could accelerate the degradation of the prints.\n\nThe main processes that would gradually degrade the boot prints on an asteroid are micrometeorite impacts and the slow movement of regolith (the loose material on the surface of the asteroid). Micrometeorite impacts can cause some erosion over time, but the scale and frequency of these impacts are relatively low. The slow movement of regolith can also gradually bury the boot prints under layers of loose material.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that the boot prints left by the astronauts could potentially last for thousands of years on a distant asteroid as it passes near Earth. Option (C) is the correct answer. Option (A) is too short of a time frame, option (B) is possible but less likely, and option (D) is too short for the potentially long-lasting effects on an asteroid."
