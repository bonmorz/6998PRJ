Sneaker waves are large, unexpected waves that can suddenly appear and sweep people off the shore. These waves are typically caused by the gravitational pull of the moon (luna) on the Earth's oceans, which creates tidal patterns. Option (A) is incorrect because the sun also plays a role in creating tides, but specifically for sneaker waves, the question is asking about a specific cause. Option (C) and (D) are unrelated to tidal patterns and are not a factor in the occurrence of sneaker waves."
