Snowy owls are typically found in arctic and subarctic regions, where they rely on specific habitats for nesting, hunting, and survival. \n\nOption (A) states that a new mall is likeliest to harm the snowy owl population. This is the correct answer because the construction of a mall can lead to habitat destruction. The mall may require clearing of land, which can eliminate the owls' nesting sites or disrupt their hunting grounds. It can also contribute to increased human activity and disturbance, which can further impact the owls' ability to successfully breed and forage.\n\nOptions (B) and (C) mention the creation of a new puddle or a new tree. These options are unlikely to harm the snowy owl population significantly. Owls are adaptable and can find alternative hunting grounds or nesting sites if a single tree or puddle is removed or added to the area. These options do not pose a major threat to the overall population.\n\nOption (D) mentions the creation of a new preserve. This option is unlikely to harm the snowy owl population. A new preserve would typically be established to protect the natural habitat and wildlife, including the snowy owls. Therefore, it is more likely to benefit the owl population rather than harm it.\n\nIn conclusion, the construction of a new mall (option A) is the likeliest scenario to harm the snowy owl population in an area due to habitat destruction and increased human disturbance."
