Animals may relocate to a new environment if their old environment experienced a large hurricane. Large hurricanes can cause significant destruction to the habitats of animals, including flooding, destruction of food sources, and changes in temperature. This can make it difficult for animals to survive in their old environment, leading them to seek out a new one. Options (B), (C), and (D) may also affect the environment, but they do not necessarily cause the same level of disruption or destruction as a large hurricane."
