When a person buys a cheap hammer and it breaks a month later, they may decide to invest in an expensive hammer in the hopes that it will last longer. Option (A), \"it endures,\" is the correct answer because the person expects the expensive hammer to be more durable and withstand heavy use. Option (B), \"died,\" is incorrect because hammers are inanimate objects and do not have the ability to die. Option (C), \"baked it,\" and option (D), \"ate it,\" are both nonsensical and unrelated to the situation."
