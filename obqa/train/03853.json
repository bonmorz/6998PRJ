A deluge refers to a severe flood or heavy downpour of rain, which can cause water levels to rise rapidly and potentially lead to the need for a raft to navigate the flooded area. Option (A) is incorrect because a television broadcast does not typically have any relation to the need for a raft. Option (B) is incorrect because a drought refers to a prolonged period of time with little to no rainfall, which would not necessitate a raft. Option (C) is incorrect because a meteor shower refers to the phenomenon of many meteors falling through the Earth's atmosphere, which would not typically lead to the need for a raft."
