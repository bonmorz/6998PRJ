During exercise, carbohydrates are broken down through a process called glycolysis to produce ATP, the body's main energy currency. This ATP is then used to power our muscles, resulting in motion and heat. Option (A) is incorrect because running does not turn carbohydrates into fat. Option (B) is incorrect because protein is not the primary fuel source during running. Option (D) is incorrect because sweat is a result of increased body temperature during exercise, not a product of carbohydrate metabolism."
