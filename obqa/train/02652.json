Biodiversity refers to the variety and abundance of different species of plants, animals, and microorganisms in a given area.\n\nBiomes such as jungles, forests, and rainforests are known for their high levels of species diversity, making options (A), (C), and (D) unlikely choices. The arctic, on the other hand, is characterized by harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and a short growing season. These conditions limit the number of species that can survive and thrive in the region compared to other biomes. As a result, the arctic has a less than average amount of biodiversity compared to other biomes, making option (B) the correct answer."
