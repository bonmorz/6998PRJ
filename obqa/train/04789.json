In frozen areas, such as snowy landscapes or ice-covered regions, the sunlight is reflected off the white surfaces, creating a very bright environment. This is due to the high albedo (reflectivity) of snow and ice. In rainy environments, the sunlight is often obstructed by clouds and rain, resulting in lower brightness. Underwater environments lack direct sunlight and are generally darker. Forest areas receive varying amounts of sunlight depending on the density of the trees, so their brightness can also vary. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer as frozen areas would likely be the brightest of the given options."
