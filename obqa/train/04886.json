A giant ice brick would be the option that moves very little over quite a lot of time. Ice tends to melt slowly, and therefore the ice brick would experience minimal movement over a long period of time. Option (A) is incorrect because a pack of wolves typically moves and hunts together. Option (B) is incorrect because racing horses are known for their fast and frequent movement. Option (C) is incorrect because falling rocks imply movement and are not stationary objects."

Option B, racing horses, implies fast and continuous movement. Option C, falling rocks, implies a downward motion and change in position. Only option D, giant ice brick, suggests an object that remains still and stationary over a long period of time."
