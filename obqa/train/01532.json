Option (A) is the correct answer because \"pass away\" is a synonym for dying or experiencing death. When a living thing is exposed to extreme cold temperatures, it can cause hypothermia, which is a dangerous condition where the body's core temperature drops too low. This can lead to impaired bodily functions, decreased energy production, and eventually organ failure. Option (B) is incorrect as \"joy\" is unrelated to the effects of extreme cold temperatures on a living thing. Option (C) is also incorrect as extreme cold temperatures can actually decrease energy production in living organisms. Option (D) is not a sufficient response as \"warmth\" is not the only requirement for survival when facing extreme cold."

Cold temperatures can cause a decrease in body temperature, leading to the slowing down of vital processes and functions. This can result in reduced metabolic activity, slowed circulation, and impaired organ function. If the cold exposure continues, it can eventually lead to tissue damage, frostbite, and even organ failure, ultimately causing the living thing to pass away.\n\nOption (B) which states \"joy\" is incorrect as cold temperatures typically do not bring about joy in living organisms. Option (C) which suggests increased energy is also incorrect, as cold temperatures often have the opposite effect, causing lethargy and decreased energy levels. Option (D) which mentions warmth is incorrect because becoming too cold indicates a lack of warmth, not an increase in it."
