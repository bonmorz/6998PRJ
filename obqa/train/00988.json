                "content": "This question requires a basic understanding of weather patterns and how mist forms. During the day, the sun warms the air and causes evaporation of water from bodies of water or moist surfaces. This moisture is then suspended in the air as water vapor. As the night progresses, the temperature drops and the air cools down. Cool air is not capable of holding as much moisture as warm air, so the water vapor condenses, forming small droplets or mist. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer as it accurately explains why the mist is prevalent at night. Option (B) is incorrect because warm air is not always found in the daytime, and it is the cooling of the air that leads to the condensation and mist formation. Option (C) is also incorrect, as it is not always misty at night and depends on various factors such as temperature and humidity. Option (D) is unrelated to the formation of mist and is incorrect."
