In ecology, a producer is an organism that is able to create its own food through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Option (B) is correct because producers generate their own sustenance or food. Option (A) is incorrect because producers do not create their own bodies, they develop and grow using the nutrients they obtain from their food source. Option (C) is incorrect because producers do not create their own air, they rely on the natural air composition in their environment. Option (D) is incorrect because grass is not something that all producers make, it is just one type of plant that can act as a producer."
