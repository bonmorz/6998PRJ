Hawks are birds of prey and their diet consists mainly of other animals, such as small mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects. While they may eat lizards, option (A) is incorrect because it refers to the droppings of lizards, not the lizards themselves. Option (C) is unlikely because cows are larger than what hawks typically prey on. Option (D) is incorrect because hawks are carnivores and do not eat grass. Therefore, option (B) is the most accurate answer as hawks are known to eat bearded dragons and other reptiles."
