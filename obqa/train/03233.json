When a river runs through a region, there is a higher chance of land mass being susceptible to water encroachment. Rivers can cause erosion and flooding, which can lead to changes in landforms and the potential for water encroachment. Option (B) is incorrect because coral reefs are typically found in marine environments, not near rivers. Option (C) is also incorrect because acid rain is a result of air pollution, not directly related to rivers. Option (D) is unrelated to the presence of a river and refers to volcanic activity."

When a river runs through a region, it usually indicates a land mass that is susceptible to water encroachment. Rivers tend to flow through areas with lower elevation or areas that have been carved out by erosion. Option (B) is incorrect because coral reefs are typically found in warm, shallow ocean waters, not close to rivers. Option (C) is unrelated to the presence of a river. Option (D) is unlikely because volcanic mountains are not typically found in close proximity to rivers."

Rivers are bodies of flowing water that provide habitats for various organisms and serve as a source of freshwater for the surrounding land. As a result, land located close to a river is often susceptible to water encroachment. The constant flow of water in the river can cause erosion and lead to flooding, which can impact the nearby land mass. \n\nOptions (B), (C), and (D) are all unrelated to the presence of a river. Option (B) mentions an active life coral reef, which typically exists in marine environments rather than in rivers. Option (C) refers to acid rain, which is caused by pollution in the atmosphere and not directly related to the presence of a river. Option (D) mentions very active volcanic mountains, which may or may not be found near a river depending on the specific geographic characteristics of the region."
