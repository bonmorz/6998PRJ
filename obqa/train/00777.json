Option (B), reusing gift bags again and again, aligns with this idea because it reduces the consumption and disposal of single-use materials. The other options (A, C, and D) all involve wasteful practices that harm the environment. Using Styrofoam plates for every meal leads to unnecessary waste, throwing plastic bottles in the landfill contributes to pollution and takes up space, and driving a gas guzzling truck consumes excessive fuel and contributes to air pollution."
