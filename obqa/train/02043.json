Citrus juice, specifically the citric acid present in it, can cause a chemical change when it reacts with other substances.

Option (A), almonds, do not cause a chemical change when consumed. Option (B), milk, can undergo a chemical change when it spoils, but this is not a typical reaction. Option (D), olive oil, does not cause a chemical change when used in normal cooking or consumption."

A chemical change occurs when the composition or structure of a substance is altered, resulting in the formation of new substances with different properties.\n\nOption (C), citrus juice, is the correct answer. Citrus juice, such as lemon or lime juice, contains citric acid. Acidic substances like citric acid can cause chemical changes when they come into contact with certain other substances. This is because acids can react with other compounds, breaking chemical bonds and forming new compounds.\n\nOptions (A) almonds, (B) milk, and (D) olive oil, are not likely to cause a chemical change on their own. Almonds are a nut and do not have any specific properties that would cause a chemical change. Milk is primarily composed of water, proteins, and fats, which are stable components and do not undergo chemical changes under normal conditions. Olive oil is a type of fat and, like milk, does not typically undergo chemical changes unless exposed to high temperatures or other external factors.\n\nOverall, citrus juice is the most likely ingredient to cause a chemical change due to its acidic nature."
