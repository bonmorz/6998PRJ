Ducks are known to lay eggs, and the number of eggs they lay can vary from year to year. In this scenario, if a duck laid seven eggs this year and last year they laid zero eggs, it means that their egg production has increased. This is because there is a significant difference between laying zero eggs and laying seven eggs. Option (A) is incorrect because the assumption is that the duck is laying eggs, which means it is female. Option (C) is also incorrect because it states they are producing zero, while the scenario clearly mentions that they laid seven eggs. Option (D) is incorrect because ducks lay eggs, which means their young are hatched from the eggs, not born live."
