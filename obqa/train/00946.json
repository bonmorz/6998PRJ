Potential energy refers to the energy stored in an object due to its position or state, while kinetic energy refers to the energy of motion.\n\nOption (D) is correct because cars spinning their tires involve the conversion of potential energy (stored energy in the form of chemical energy in the fuel) to kinetic energy (the energy of the moving car). As the tires accelerate and spin, the car's potential energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the moving car.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because a resting bird does not involve the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy.
