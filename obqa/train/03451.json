This phenomenon is studied and observed by scientists who are interested in understanding migration patterns and behaviors of these birds. \n\nOption (A) \"planes departing\" is not studied once annually, as planes depart from airports around the world on a daily basis and are not specifically studied for their departure frequency. \n\nOption (B) \"cats purring\" is also not studied once annually because cats purr regularly and it is not a phenomenon that occurs once a year. \n\nOption (D) \"rats flying\" is not a natural behavior and is not studied because rats are not capable of flying."
