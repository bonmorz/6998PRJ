Urine is a waste product excreted by the body, and slurping it down would not be a natural or healthy behavior. Option (A) is incorrect because bed-wetting refers to involuntary urination during sleep, which is a separate issue. Option (C) is incorrect because menstruation is the shedding of the uterine lining and not related to urine. Option (D) is unrelated to urine and refers to the preservation of wetlands, which is a different environmental concern. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) recycling, as the act of slurping down urine would be considered a form of recycling waste."
