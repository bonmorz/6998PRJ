When a greater amount of light is condensed in an area, such as in urban or densely populated areas with more artificial light sources, it creates light pollution and makes it more difficult to see stars in the night sky. Option (A) is incorrect because the condensation of stars in the sky does not affect their visibility. Option (C) is incorrect because floodlights at sea may affect visibility in that specific area, but it does not impact the visibility of stars in general. Option (D) is incorrect because the presence of spaceships hovering over Earth does not inherently affect the visibility of stars."
