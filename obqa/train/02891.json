A seeing eye dog is trained to assist individuals with visual impairments, and one of their main abilities is to observe visually. They are able to guide their master, navigate obstacles, and ensure their safety by visually assessing the environment. Option (A) is incorrect because although a seeing eye dog can be trained to open certain types of doors, their primary function is not to open doors. Option (B) is incorrect because a seeing eye dog cannot speak out loud. Option (C) is incorrect because a seeing eye dog is not able to \"talk\" to friends in the same way a human can."
