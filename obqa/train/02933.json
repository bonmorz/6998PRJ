It is a poor conductor of electricity, meaning it does not easily allow electric current to pass through it. Therefore, it can be considered an anti-conductor. Option (A) is incorrect because adobe is not typically used as a paper weight. Option (B) is incorrect because adobe is not used as a pie filler. Option (C) is incorrect because adobe does not have the property of being a chiller."
