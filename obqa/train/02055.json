The moon is the least massive option because its mass is much smaller compared to the Earth, the sun, and the solar system as a whole. While the Earth is larger than the moon, it has a greater mass due to its higher density. The sun is significantly larger and more massive than both the Earth and the moon. The solar system consists of all the planets, moons, asteroids, and other celestial bodies orbiting around the sun, so it has a much greater combined mass compared to any individual body within it. Thus, the moon is the least massive option among the given choices."
