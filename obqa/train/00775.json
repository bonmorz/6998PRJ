When humans lack food, their bodies enter a state of calorie deficit, meaning they are not consuming enough calories to meet their energy needs. In this state, the body begins to break down stored fat and muscle tissue in order to provide energy, resulting in weight loss and a thinner appearance. Option (B) is incorrect because eating too much can lead to weight gain, not thinning. Option (C) is essentially the same as option (B), indicating excessive food intake, which would result in weight gain. Option (D) is too vague and general to be considered correct or incorrect."
