When an object reflects light, it enters our eyes and stimulates the visual organs, which send signals to the brain for interpretation. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) visual organ. Option (B) is a play on words and not related to the process of seeing. Option (C) is incorrect because light reflecting off an object does not affect the feet. Option (D) is incorrect because the brain receives signals from the visual organ, but it is not where the reflection of light is directed."
