Since the subject is people eating cereal, we can assume that the cereal is made from ingredients such as corn. Thus, with more people eating cereal, there would be a need for more corn to produce the cereal. Option (A) is unrelated to cereal consumption. Option (B) may seem logical, but it is not directly related to cereal consumption. Option (C) is also a possibility, as water is needed for agricultural practices to grow crops like corn, but since the question specifically mentions cereal, the most direct answer would be (D) corn."
