As the earth glides from winter into spring, the temperature begins to rise and plants start to receive more sunlight. This triggers the growth of new leaves on trees and plants, hence the correct answer is (A) leaves growing. Option (B) is incorrect because blizzards occur during winter, not during the transition to spring. Option (C) is incorrect because bears typically come out of hibernation in the spring, not start hibernating. Option (D) is incorrect because leaves turning orange is typically associated with the transition from summer to autumn, not winter to spring."
