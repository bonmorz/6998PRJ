When a turkey thermometer is inserted into the turkey and the turkey is cooked in an oven, the heat causes the air inside the thermometer to expand. As the air expands, it creates pressure, which pushes the plunger cap off. This is why option (B) is correct. Option (A) is incorrect because cold uranium ore has no direct relationship to the expansion of air in a turkey thermometer. Option (C) is incorrect because lead does not expand in the same way as air when heated. Option (D) is incorrect because gas generally expands when heated, not contracts."
