A learned trait is something that is not determined by genetics, but rather acquired through experience or cultural influences. Skin color, nose shape, and hair color are all determined by our genetic makeup and are not influenced by learning. Option (D), favorite cookie variety, is a learned trait because it is a preference that is acquired through individual experiences and personal choices."

Options (A), (B), and (C) are all examples of inherited traits, meaning they are determined by genetics and not influenced by the environment or behavior. For example, skin color, nose shape, and hair color are all primarily determined by genes passed down from parents to offspring.\n\nOption (D), favorite cookie variety, is the correct answer as it is a trait that can be influenced by individual preferences and experiences. A person's favorite cookie variety is not determined by genetics but rather by personal tastes and experiences with different types of cookies."
