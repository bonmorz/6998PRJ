The locked box would also provide a level of protection against accidental gunshot wounds.\n\nOption (C), ceremonial burning, can be ruled out because there is no mention of any burn marks or evidence of burning on the tern's body or in the box.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of death would be option (D), untouched asphyxiation. Since the bird was found dead inside a locked box, it is possible that it suffocated due to a lack of oxygen. The box being locked would have prevented the bird from escaping or finding fresh air.\n\nBased on the information provided, the absence of any visible marks on the bird or its surroundings, and the presence of a locked box, untouched asphyxiation is the most reasonable explanation for the tern's death."
