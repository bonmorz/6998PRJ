Option (B) is also incorrect because gas (presumably referring to natural gas) is a fossil fuel with environmental consequences. Option (C) is incorrect because fracking is associated with various environmental issues such as groundwater contamination and earthquakes."

Wind energy is a renewable and clean source of power, as it does not produce greenhouse gas emissions or significant pollution. Windmills are considered ecologically-friendly because they help reduce dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate the environmental impacts associated with their extraction and combustion.\n\nTherefore, an ecologically-minded individual would most likely support windmills as a sustainable and environmentally-friendly energy source.
