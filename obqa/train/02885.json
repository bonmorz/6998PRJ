While darkness may be beneficial for some plants during the germination process, it is not the primary factor for sustaining a bamboo shoot. Bees are important for pollination, but they do not directly sustain the growth of a bamboo shoot. Pandas may eat bamboo shoots, but they do not contribute to their sustenance. The correct answer is (C) nutrients. Like all plants, bamboo shoots require nutrients, such as minerals and water, to support their growth and development. Nutrients are absorbed by the bamboo plant's roots from the soil and are essential for the shoot's overall health and well-being."
