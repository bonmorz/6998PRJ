Crude oil is the original form of fossil fuel that is used to power most automobiles. It is extracted from deposits in the Earth's crust and then refined into gasoline or diesel fuel. Option (A) is incorrect because a can of water cannot be used as a source of power for automobiles. Option (C) is incorrect because while a large river dam can generate electricity, it is not the original form of what powers most autos.
