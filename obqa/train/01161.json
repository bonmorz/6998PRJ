Electrical conduction occurs when a voltage flows through a material that allows the movement of electric charges. In this case, the only option that represents a material capable of conducting electricity is option (C), a piece of steel wool. Option (A) is incorrect because the central nervous system conducts electrical impulses, not voltage. Option (B) may conduct electricity if it is wet or has ions present, but it is not inherently conductive. Option (D) is incorrect because pure water is a poor conductor of electricity."
