The summer solstice occurs when the sun is at its highest point in the sky, which happens in the upper portion of the earth. The correct answer is (B).

Option (C) is incorrect because the lower portion of the earth refers to the southern hemisphere, where the summer solstice actually occurs on December 21st.
