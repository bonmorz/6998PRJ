In the case of a bear, it will have many animals that are fearful of it because it can potentially prey on them. Option (A) is incorrect because cuddling implies a friendly interaction, which is unlikely between a bear and its prey. Option (B) is incorrect because being hungry for the bear implies that the bear is the prey, which is not the case.

An omnivore is an animal that consumes both plant and animal matter. In the case of a bear, it will have many animals that are fearful of it. This is because bears are known to be predators, capable of hunting and consuming other animals. Option (A) is incorrect because animals typically do not cuddle with predators. Option (B) is also incorrect because animals being hungry for the bear implies that they want to eat it, which is unlikely. Option (C) is incorrect because while an omnivore like a bear may consume other animals, it does not mean that all animals it encounters will consume it."
