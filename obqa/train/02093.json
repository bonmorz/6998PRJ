During a week-long storm with heavy rain, there will be an abundance of water everywhere. The deluges of rain would result in water being widely available throughout the town. Option (B) is incorrect because the presence of a storm and heavy rain implies that water is not missing. Option (C) is also incorrect because in this scenario, water is not in short supply but rather in excess. Option (D) is incorrect because the continuous rain would make water less rare and more readily available."
