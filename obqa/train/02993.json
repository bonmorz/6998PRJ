When a continent is located nearer the north pole than the south, it experiences shorter daylight hours during the winter months. This is because during winter, the tilt of the Earth's axis causes the north pole to be tilted away from the sun, resulting in shorter days and longer nights in the northern hemisphere. Option (A) is incorrect because the days are shorter, not longer, in winter. Option (B) is incorrect because the days are shorter, not longer, in winter. Option (C) is incorrect because the daylight hours are decreasing, not growing, in winter."
