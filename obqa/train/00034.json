Light pollution refers to the excessive or misdirected artificial light that interferes with natural darkness. It usually occurs in urban areas due to the abundance of artificial lighting sources.\n\nIn the wilderness, there are generally fewer human settlements and minimal artificial lighting, resulting in less light pollution. Option (A) is the correct answer because the wilderness experiences reduced light pollution compared to urban areas. Options (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because they imply an increase in light pollution, which is not the case in the wilderness."
