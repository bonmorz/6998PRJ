When visibility decreases, such as in fog or heavy rain, it can lead to accidents and crashes. Option (A) is incorrect because decreased visibility does not directly cause people to crash their food. Option (C) is unrelated as decreased visibility does not impact someone's career. Option (D) is unrelated as decreased visibility does not cause people to crash wind. Option (B) is the correct answer as it refers to specific Chevy car models, suggesting that decreased visibility can cause people to crash their Chevy 2000s while driving."
