When baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and vinegar (acetic acid) are mixed together, they undergo a chemical reaction. The reaction produces carbon dioxide gas, water, and a salt. This reaction is often used in baking or as a cleaning agent. Option (A) is incorrect because the mixture does not immediately boil, although it may produce some fizzy bubbles due to the release of carbon dioxide gas. Option (B) is incorrect because the mixture does not turn hard. Option (D) is incorrect because the two substances do react when combined together. Option (C) correctly states that there is a combined reaction between baking soda and vinegar."

When you mix baking soda and vinegar together, they undergo a chemical reaction called an acid-base reaction. This reaction produces carbon dioxide gas, water, and a salt. The bubbling and fizzing that occurs is a result of the release of carbon dioxide gas. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer as it accurately describes the combined reaction between baking soda and vinegar. Option (A) is incorrect because they will not boil, they will produce gas. Option (B) is incorrect because they will not turn hard, they will produce a gas and liquid. Option (D) is incorrect because they do have a reaction when mixed together."
