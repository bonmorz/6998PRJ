They have a preference for nuts, seeds, and fruits, which provide them with the necessary nutrients and energy. However, squirrels typically do not eat animals. They do not have the physical adaptations or hunting behaviors of carnivorous animals. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer."

Therefore, options (A), (B), and (C) are all true statements because squirrels do eat plants, seeds, and fruits.\n\nOption (D) states that squirrels do not eat animals, which is correct. Squirrels are not carnivorous and do not typically prey on animals or eat meat. They are mainly vegetarian in their diet and rely on plants and plant-based foods for their nutrition. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer because it states what squirrels do not eat, which is animals."
