When a person crumples a page of a book, the page becomes wrinkled and loses its flat and smooth surface. It takes on a rounded shape due to the folding and creasing. Option (A) is incorrect because the page is no longer flat after being crumpled. Option (B) is incorrect because the wrinkles created when crumpling make the page no longer smooth. Option (C) is incorrect because tearing refers to ripping the page apart, which is not specified in the question."

When a person crumples a page, it becomes wrinkled and no longer retains its previous shape of being flat. Wrinkled paper often takes on a more rounded or irregular shape.

Option (C) is incorrect because tearing refers to the act of ripping something apart, which is not described in the question."
