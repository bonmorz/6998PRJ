When a screw is set in the sun's path, it increases in temperature due to the process of conduction. Conduction is the transfer of heat through direct contact between two objects. In this case, the screw absorbs heat from the sunlight through direct contact, causing its temperature to rise. Option (A) is incorrect because a heating element refers to a device used to generate heat, not the process by which the screw heats up. Option (B) is unrelated to the question, as a screw is not a building device.
