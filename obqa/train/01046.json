Option (A) is the correct answer because it refers to refilling a lake that evaporated. When a lake evaporates, it loses water, and refilling it ensures that it remains a natural resource for communities and ecosystems. Option (B) is incorrect because planting a flower in a garden does not replace a natural resource. It may beautify the garden, but it does not replenish a natural resource. Option (C) is also incorrect because growing a bush in a yard does not replace a natural resource. It may enhance the aesthetics of the yard but does not contribute to resource replenishment. Option (D) is also incorrect because planting a berry patch does not replace a natural resource. It may provide a source of food, but it does not replenish a natural resource in the same way that refilling a lake does."
