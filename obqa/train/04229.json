Option (A) \"buyer beware\" is a phrase that warns buyers to be cautious when making purchases, but it is not directly related to the seller's strategy. Option (B) \"Auction Block\" refers to the location where the auction takes place and does not provide a strategy for the seller. Option (C) \"Sealed Bid\" is a method where buyers submit their bids in sealed envelopes, but it does not address how the seller can avoid losses. Option (D) \"setting a reserve\" is the correct answer because a reserve price is the minimum value that the seller is willing to accept for the item being auctioned. By setting a reserve, the seller ensures that the item will not be sold for less than a desired amount, avoiding a significant loss."

Option (D) is the correct answer because setting a reserve price allows the seller to establish a minimum price that must be met in order for the item to be sold.

Option (A) is incorrect because \"buyer beware\" is a phrase advising buyers to be cautious and aware of potential risks, not a strategy for sellers. Option (B) is not a common auction strategy.

One way a seller can avoid a significant loss in an auction is by setting a reserve price. A reserve price is the minimum price at which the seller is willing to sell the item. If the bidding does not reach the reserve price, the item will not be sold. This allows the seller to avoid selling the item for less than they are willing to accept. Option (A) \"buyer beware\" is not a strategy for the seller but rather a warning for potential buyers to be cautious. Option (B) \"Auction Block\" is not a strategy but rather a term used to describe the location where items are auctioned. Option (C) \"Sealed Bid\" is a different type of auction format where bidders submit their bids in sealed envelopes, and the highest bid wins, it is not a strategy for a seller to avoid losses."
