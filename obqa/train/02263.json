Option (A) suggests that a careless bird may have started the fire. While it is possible for birds to accidentally start fires, this option assumes that the bird was behaving in a careless manner, which is unlikely. Option (B) suggests that a smoking bear may have started the fire. While bears may be attracted to smoke or fire, it is unlikely for a bear to intentionally start a fire. Option (D) suggests that a campfire may have started the fire. However, since the question states that the fire was not started by people, this option is also unlikely. \n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is option (C) - electricity. Forest fires can be started by natural causes such as lightning strikes. Lightning produces an electrical charge that can ignite flammable materials in a forest, leading to a fire. This option aligns with the information provided and is the most plausible cause for a fire in a forest that was not started by people."
