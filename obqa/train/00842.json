Option (A) is correct because talking to plants can help provide carbon dioxide, which is necessary for photosynthesis. Option (B) is incorrect because cutting a plant from the roots will cause harm and potentially kill it. Option (C) is incorrect because plants need sunlight for photosynthesis and storing them in the dark will inhibit their growth. Option (D) is incorrect because watering is essential for plant survival, and refusing to water it will lead to dehydration and eventually death of the plant."

Plants benefit from various care practices, but one of the ways we can help a plant is by talking to it or telling it a story. This is because plants respond positively to sound vibrations and may grow better when exposed to human speech. Option (B) is incorrect because cutting a plant from the roots would harm or kill it. Option (C) is also incorrect because most plants require light to carry out photosynthesis and grow. Option (D) is incorrect because plants need water to survive and thrive."
