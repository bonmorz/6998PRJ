Seismic activities, such as earthquakes, can cause an abrupt change in the surface appearance of the Earth, which is referred to as terra. Option (B) is unrelated to seismic activities. Option (C) is possible, as seismic activities can cause the ground to shake, which may result in flowers toppling over or being damaged. Option (D) is also possible, as trees can be uprooted or damaged during an earthquake. However, the most accurate answer is option (A) since seismic activities can have a more significant and widespread impact on the overall surface appearance of the Earth."
