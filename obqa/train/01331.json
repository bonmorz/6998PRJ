Factories often release pollutants into the environment, such as toxic chemicals or other harmful substances. These pollutants can have negative effects on air, water, and soil quality, and can be poisonous to living organisms. Options (A), (B), and (C) are all incorrect because they imply positive or beneficial effects of factories on the environment, which is not typically the case. Option (D) accurately describes the negative impact that factories can have on the environment."
