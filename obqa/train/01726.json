Bees are important pollinators that help plants reproduce by transferring pollen from the male parts of a flower to the female parts. When bees surround a plant and climb all over it, they are likely collecting or depositing pollen. The next year, this plant type may roll out or spread more widely because the bees have helped to pollinate it and facilitate its reproduction. Option (A) is incorrect because the presence of bees would actually increase the chances of successful pollination and result in more plants, not fewer.
