Option (A) is the correct answer because Rigel is the name of a star, and light from stars can travel through a vacuum. Option (B) is incorrect because oil wells are sources of petroleum, which cannot travel through a vacuum. Option (C) is incorrect because volcanoes are landforms that emit lava and gases, neither of which can travel through a vacuum. Option (D) is incorrect because icebergs are chunks of ice floating in water and cannot travel through a vacuum."
