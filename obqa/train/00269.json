To answer this question correctly, we need to consider what can be transported and how it can affect different aspects of life.\n\nIncreased transport ability allows for the movement of goods and resources from one place to another more efficiently. This can lead to an increase in the availability of various types of items, including grains. Grains can be transported from areas where they are grown to areas where they are needed, increasing the options and variety of grains available in different regions.\n\nOptions (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because they are not directly related to the impact of increased transport ability. Increased transport ability may have indirect effects on houses, education, and the internet (such as making materials and resources more accessible), but these options do not represent the most direct impact of increased transport ability."
