When two rocks are rubbed together, the rough surfaces of the rocks will start to wear down and become smoother over time. This is due to the abrasion caused by the rubbing motion, which causes the rocks to gradually lose small particles and become smoother. Option (B) is incorrect because rocks cannot transform into butterflies. Option (C) is unrelated as it suggests a different outcome related to art. Option (D) is also unrelated as it suggests a different outcome related to furniture-making."
