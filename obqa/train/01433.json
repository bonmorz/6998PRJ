An acquired characteristic is a trait that is developed or acquired during an individual's lifetime, usually as a result of environmental influences or experiences. Option (A) is the correct answer because it describes a physical mark that was acquired as a result of falling down the stairs. Options (B), (C), and (D) describe traits that are inherited from genetics and not acquired throughout life."

Option (A) is the correct answer because a jagged raised welt from falling down the stairs is an example of an acquired characteristic. It is not something that was inherited from one's parents, but rather a physical characteristic that developed as a result of a specific event. \n\nOptions (B), (C), and (D) are not examples of acquired characteristics. Option (B) mentions freckles, which are typically determined by genetics and inherited from parents. Option (C) mentions brown, curly hair that resembles a sibling's, which could also be determined by genetics. Option (D) mentions a large nose, just like a parent's, which again suggests a genetic inheritance rather than an acquired characteristic."
