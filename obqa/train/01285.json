The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction that happens between amino acids and reducing sugars in food, resulting in a browning effect and the release of flavorful compounds. Option (A) is incorrect because roasting marshmallows is a snack or dessert activity, not a full dinner. Option (B) is unrelated as fusion usually refers to the process of combining different cuisines or cooking styles. Option (D) is unrelated as there is no competition happening in this scenario."
