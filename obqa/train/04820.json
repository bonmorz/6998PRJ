Greenhouse gases are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. Common greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. In this case, the correct answer is (A) elephants. Elephants produce methane gas as a byproduct of their digestion. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Options (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because pears, boulders, and oaks do not produce greenhouse gases."
