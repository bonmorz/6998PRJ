Sailors would use stars, specifically the never moving star or the North Star, to guide themselves. The North Star (Polaris) remains stationary in the night sky, making it a reliable reference point for determining direction. Option (A) is incorrect because the sun is not visible at night and therefore cannot be used for guidance. Option (B) is incorrect because the moon moves across the sky and changes position throughout the night. Option (D) is incorrect because lighthouses were used as visual markers along coastlines, but they do not help with navigation in open waters."
