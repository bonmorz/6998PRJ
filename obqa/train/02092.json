When a person approaches a dog from across the street, the dog will look more sizable after approaching. This is because our eyes perceive objects as larger when they are closer to us.

When a person approaches a dog from across a street, the dog will appear more sizable or larger after approaching. This is because as we move closer to an object, the visual angle of that object increases, making it appear larger. Option (A) is incorrect because the dog would not look tiny when nearer, but rather larger. Option (B) is an exaggeration and not true in most cases. Option (D) is incorrect because the dog would not look smaller up close, but rather larger."

When a person is approaching a dog from across the street, the dog will appear smaller from a distance. However, as the person gets closer to the dog, it will start to look more sizable. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because the dog actually looks smaller when nearer. Option (B) is a stronger version of option (A) and is also incorrect. Option (D) is the opposite of what actually happens - the dog looks smaller up close, not larger."
