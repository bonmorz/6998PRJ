Drought conditions occur when there is an extended period of abnormally low rainfall or water availability. Option (D) is the correct answer because a lake without water is most likely to occur in drought conditions. In drought, the water level in lakes decreases significantly, sometimes leading to complete drying up. Option (A) is incorrect because a tundra is a cold, treeless, frozen biome where water is typically available, although it may be in a frozen state. Option (B) is also incorrect because deserts usually receive very little rainfall throughout the year, so the absence of water is not necessarily indicative of drought conditions. Option (C) is unrelated to natural environments and does not provide information about drought conditions."
