If a kitten is unable to nurse from birth, it will not receive the necessary nutrients and may not survive.

Option (C) is also incorrect because sleeping is a normal behavior for kittens and does not indicate an inability to nurse. Option (D) is unlikely as vomiting is not a direct result of inability to nurse, but could be a symptom of other issues."
