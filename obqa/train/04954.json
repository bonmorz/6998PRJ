The nimbleness or agility of an animal is an important adaptation that allows it to quickly evade and escape attacks from predators. Option (A) is incorrect because while the praying mantis has its own unique adaptations, nimbleness is not one of them. Option (C) is incorrect because while butterflies are capable of agile flight, their adaptations for evading predators primarily involve camouflage. Option (D) is incorrect because sloths are known for their slow movement and are not agile enough to escape predators. The antelope, on the other hand, is known for its speed and agility, making it well-equipped to escape predators in the wild."

Adaptations are traits or characteristics that help an organism survive and thrive in its environment. In this case, the animal that is specifically mentioned and known for its nimbleness is the antelope. Antelopes have long legs and are incredibly agile, allowing them to quickly escape from predators. The praying mantis is not known for its nimbleness but rather for its ability to camouflage and remain still. The butterfly is known for its flying abilities but not necessarily for nimbleness. The sloth, on the other hand, is slow-moving and not nimble at all. Therefore, option (B) the antelope is the correct answer."

The key adaption mentioned in the question is nimbleness, which refers to the ability to move quickly and skillfully. \n\nOption (A), the praying mantis, has certain abilities like camouflage and agile movements, but it is not primarily known for its nimbleness. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\nOption (B), the antelope, is a better choice as it is known for its speed and agility. Antelopes have long and powerful legs that allow them to run quickly and change direction rapidly, helping them escape from predators. This characteristic perfectly fits the description of \"nimbleness\" mentioned in the question.\n\nOption (C), the butterfly, has the ability to fly, but it is not typically associated with nimbleness in the context of escaping predators. Butterflies rely more on their bright colors and patterns for protection rather than their agility.\n\nOption (D), the sloth, is slow-moving and not known for its nimbleness. Sloths have a unique adaptation to blend in with trees and avoid detection from predators, but their slowness hinders their ability to escape quickly.\n\nIn conclusion, the antelope (option B) is the most appropriate choice as its nimbleness is a key adaptation that allows it to escape attacks from predators."
