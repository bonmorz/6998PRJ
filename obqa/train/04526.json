Alternative biofuels are renewable fuels made from organic matter, such as plants or animal waste. \n\nAs the use of alt biofuels increases, it means that more energy is being generated from these renewable sources. As a result, the use of non-regenerating fuels, such as fossil fuels, will decrease. This is because the focus is shifting towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly fuel options.\n\nOptions (A) and (B) are incorrect because the increase in alt biofuels does not directly impact the use of wind power or solar heat. These forms of renewable energy can still be utilized alongside alternative biofuels. Option (C) is incorrect because the increase in alt biofuels does not necessarily lead to a decrease in hydro-electric power. These are separate sources of renewable energy that can coexist."
