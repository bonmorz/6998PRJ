When molten lava comes into contact with a car, it does not freeze into a solid (option A) because the temperature of the lava is much higher than the freezing point of most materials found in a car. It also does not turn into a gas (option B) because the car is not able to cause the lava to vaporize immediately. Option D, \"it flies up into the sky,\" is not accurate because the weight of the car would prevent it from being propelled upwards. Option C, \"it reaches its melting point,\" is the correct answer. The heat from the lava can cause the car to reach its melting point and begin to melt."

When molten lava, which is in a liquid state due to its high temperature, comes into contact with a car, it does not freeze into a solid (option A) because the car is not able to cool the lava to its solidification temperature. It does not turn into a gas (option B) because the temperature of the lava is already above its boiling point, so it does not further vaporize. It does not fly up into the sky (option D) because gravity keeps the lava grounded. The correct answer is option C, which states that when the molten lava comes into contact with the car, it reaches its melting point. This means that the intense heat of the lava causes the car, which is composed of solid materials, to melt and possibly catch fire if it is flammable."
