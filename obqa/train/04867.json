Wind is considered a renewable resource because it is naturally replenished and will not run out. Metal, on the other hand, is a nonrenewable resource because once it is extracted from the Earth, it cannot be replaced in a short period of time. Option (B) and (C) are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the renewable or nonrenewable nature of wind and metal. Option (D) is incorrect because wind is actually considered a renewable resource."
