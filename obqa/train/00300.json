Humans are primarily made up of water, with water accounting for about 60% of our total body weight. Option (A) is incorrect because while air is necessary for human survival, humans themselves are not made up of air. Option (B) is incorrect because while sunlight is necessary for certain biological processes in the body, humans are not made up of sunlight. Option (D) is incorrect because humans are not plants and have different biological structures and functions."
