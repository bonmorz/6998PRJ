In the winter, when temperatures drop, many plants enter a period of dormancy and lose their green color. This is because colder temperatures can cause cellular damage and limit the plant's ability to carry out photosynthesis. Option (A) is incorrect because flowers do not have the ability to fly away. Option (B) and (C) are figurative language and not related to the actual behavior of plants. Option (D) accurately describes the fate of the flowers as they will not survive the winter conditions."
