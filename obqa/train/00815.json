Photosynthesis is a process by which plants convert sunlight into energy. Option (B) is the correct answer because it refers to the sunlight that takes approximately 8.3 minutes to travel from the sun to Earth, which is the energy required for photosynthesis to occur. Option (A) is incorrect because there is no chemical with the atomic number 18 specifically needed for photosynthesis. Option (C) is incorrect because there is no specific 8th entry on the periodic table that is required for photosynthesis. Option (D) is incorrect because while the most prevalent chemical in the atmosphere is nitrogen, it is not directly related to photosynthesis."
