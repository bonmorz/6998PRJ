The black mamba is known to be one of the most venomous snakes in the world, so if a person dies from a snake bite, there is a higher likelihood that they were bitten by a black mamba. Option (A) is incorrect because bull snakes are not venomous. Option (B) is incorrect because pythons are typically not venomous and instead kill their prey by constriction. Option (D) is incorrect because boas are also typically not venomous."
