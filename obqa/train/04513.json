From the passage, we can infer that the meadow no longer has any food for the fox, as the rabbits have all been eaten and the field is dry and barren. Therefore, the likely outcome for the fox is that it will starve if it cannot find any other sources of food. Option (A) is incorrect because foxes are not capable of flying. Option (B) is also incorrect because foxes do not speak. Option (C) is not likely because hibernation is a strategy used by some animals during winter when food is scarce, but it is not mentioned in the passage and the season is not specified. The most logical answer is option (D) - the fox will starve if it cannot find another source of food."
