Coral plants are typically found in shallow waters, such as coral reefs. They require warm and shallow water with access to sunlight for photosynthesis. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because depths usually have less sunlight and colder temperatures, which are not ideal for coral plants. Option (B) is incorrect because jungle environments are typically found in land areas, not in water. Option (C) is incorrect because the Arctic has extremely cold temperatures, which are not suitable for coral plants."
