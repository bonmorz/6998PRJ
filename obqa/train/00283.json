Organisms require energy in order to perform functions such as growth, development, and maturation. Option (A) is incorrect because rest is a state of reduced activity and does not require energy. Option (B) is incorrect because organisms do not absorb light for energy, but rather use light as a source of energy through the process of photosynthesis (in plants) or as a signal for various physiological processes (in animals). Option (C) is partially correct because organisms do require energy to take in and process nutrients, but this answer does not encompass all the functions that energy is required for, such as cell division and tissue development. Therefore, option (D) is the most comprehensive and accurate answer."
