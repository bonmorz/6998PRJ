Lobsters primarily eat meat and are not likely to eat berries. Tigers are carnivores and primarily eat meat, although they may occasionally eat berries if they are not able to find meat. Walruses primarily eat mollusks and other invertebrates and are not likely to eat berries. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) a sparrow."
