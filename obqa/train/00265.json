Option (A) states that electricity causes less damage to the Earth's atmosphere than gasoline. This is because electricity can be generated from renewable sources like wind, solar, and hydro power, which produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, gasoline is derived from fossil fuels and burning it releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. \n\nOptions (B) and (D), potatoes and water, are not directly related to the environmental impact of electricity and are incorrect choices. Option (C), the sun, is a viable source of renewable energy, but it is not as specific as option (A) in comparing the impact of electricity and gasoline on the Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer."
