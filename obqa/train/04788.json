The question states that trees that provided shade in a city were felled by a storm, and asks how to replenish that shade. Option (A) is incorrect because growing gills and living on a raft is not a feasible solution for replenishing shade. Option (B) is unrelated to shade replenishment and is not a practical solution. Option (C) is also unrelated to shade replenishment and is not a practical solution. Option (D) is the correct answer because introducing replacement timber items, such as planting new trees, would help replenish the shade in the city.
