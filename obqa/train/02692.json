Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, and it is directly proportional to both an object's mass and the square of its velocity. \n\nOption (A), a beach ball, would likely have some kinetic energy if it is in motion, but it is typically lightweight and does not have a high velocity, so its kinetic energy would be relatively low compared to the other options.\n\nOption (B), a tossed balloon, would also have some kinetic energy as it moves through the air, but since it is very lightweight, its mass is low compared to the other options, resulting in a lower kinetic energy.\n\nOption (C), a sleeping person, has no significant movement and therefore no kinetic energy. Kinetic energy depends on an object's motion, so a sleeping person would not have any appreciable kinetic energy.\n\nOption (D), a thrown racquetball, would have the highest kinetic energy among the options. A racquetball is typically dense and can be thrown at high velocity. The combination of its mass and velocity would result in the highest kinetic energy compared to the other options."
