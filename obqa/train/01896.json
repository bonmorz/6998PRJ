When an individual is forced to pedal harder on a bicycle, their body requires more oxygen to meet the increased demand for energy. This leads to an increase in heart rate to pump more oxygenated blood to the muscles. Option (A) is incorrect because the pulse rate would not stay the same during increased exertion. Option (B) is incorrect because the pulse rate would not decrease during increased exertion. Option (C) is incorrect because the pulse rate would not stop, as the heart needs to continue pumping blood to supply oxygen to the muscles."

When an individual is forced to pedal harder on a bicycle, it means they are exerting more energy and their body requires more oxygen. To meet this increased demand, the heart pumps faster, resulting in an increase in pulse rate. Option (A) is incorrect because the exertion on the bicycle will cause the pulse rate to increase. Option (B) is incorrect because the increased effort will lead to an increased pulse rate. Option (C) is incorrect because the heart cannot stop beating while the individual is exerting themselves.
