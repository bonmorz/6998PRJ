The question states that the person drove two hundred miles today and knows the amount of time spent. To figure out how fast they went, they need to divide the distance traveled (200 miles) by the time spent. Option (A) is incorrect because it refers to being behind a horse, which is unrelated to calculating speed. Option (B) is also incorrect because eating ice cream has no impact on calculating speed. Option (D) is incorrect because driving with windows down does not affect the calculation of speed. Only option (C) is relevant because it pertains to driving on the road, which is the factor that determines the distance traveled."
