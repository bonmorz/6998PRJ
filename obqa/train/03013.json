Northern countries, particularly those in Arctic and subarctic regions, have a history of glaciation. Glacial erosion occurs when glaciers move and carve out the land, creating valleys, fjords, and other landforms. This is known as glacial liquification, which is the process by which glaciers melt and the meltwater contributes to erosion. Option (B) is incorrect because \"cola mining\" is not related to erosion. Option (C) is incorrect because tornadoes are not typically associated with erosion. Option (D) is also incorrect because meteors do not have a significant impact on erosion in northern countries."
