These animals use echolocation to navigate and communicate with each other. They emit clicks and listen for the echoes to determine the location of objects and other individuals. Therefore, the correct answer is option (D) - clicks. Options (A) and (B) are incorrect because blowhole signals are not related to radio waves or air horns. Option (C) is also incorrect because blowholes are not used for hearing human speech."
