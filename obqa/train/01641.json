Option (A) suggests that the deer was caught by appendages on the feet of a feline. Felines, such as cougars or mountain lions, have sharp claws that they use to catch and hold onto their prey. This option is a plausible explanation for how the deer could have been caught and partially eaten in the forest.\n\nOption (B) suggests that a raccoon jumped on the deer's back and killed and ate it. While raccoons are omnivores and can eat small animals, it is unlikely that a raccoon would be able to kill and eat a deer due to their size difference.\n\nOption (C) suggests that the deer was caught by a horse's mouth. Horses are herbivores and do not typically hunt or eat other animals, so this option is unlikely.\n\nOption (D) suggests that the deer was shot by a bear. While bears are capable of hunting and killing deer, the question states that the deer was found partially eaten, indicating that it was not killed by a gunshot.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation is option (A) - the deer was caught by appendages on the feet of a feline, such as a cougar or mountain lion."

Option (A) suggests that the deer was caught by appendages on the feet of a feline. Felines include animals like lions, tigers, and domestic cats, which have sharp claws on their paws. It is possible that a feline caught the deer using its claws to grab onto the deer's feet or legs. This is a plausible explanation as felines are known to hunt and catch prey in this manner.\n\nOption (B) suggests that a raccoon jumped on the deer's back and killed and ate it. Raccoons are small animals that typically hunt smaller prey like rodents, birds, and insects. While it is possible for a raccoon to scavenge on a dead deer and feed on it, it is unlikely that a raccoon could have killed a healthy deer on its own.\n\nOption (C) suggests that the deer was caught by a horse's mouth. Horses are herbivores and do not hunt or eat meat. It is highly unlikely that a horse would catch a deer in its mouth.\n\nOption (D) suggests that the deer was shot by a bear.
