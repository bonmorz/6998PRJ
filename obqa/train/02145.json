The needle of a compass is magnetized and aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field, which points towards the Earth's magnetic north pole. Therefore, if the needle of the compass is pointing north, it means that the person is facing south. To go south, the person needs to walk in the opposite direction of where the needle points. Option (A) is incorrect because walking towards where the needle points would actually take the person towards the north. Option (C) is incorrect because walking away from the compass does not necessarily mean going towards the south. Option (D) is incorrect because the person is specifically described as \"wanting to go south,\" indicating that they have the intention to use the compass."
