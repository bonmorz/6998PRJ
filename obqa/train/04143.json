Weathering refers to the breaking down of rocks, soil, and minerals on the Earth's surface. When a plant lays down roots, it can cause physical weathering of the surrounding materials. In this case, the most likely material to be weathered by the plant roots is a dirt driveway. Dirt driveways are made up of loose soil particles and are more susceptible to erosion and weathering compared to other options. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because bird feathers are not typically affected by plant roots and do not undergo weathering in the same way. Option (B) is unrelated to the process of plant roots and weathering. Option (D) is incorrect because while ocean waves can cause erosion and weathering of coastal areas, it is not directly related to the process of a plant laying down roots."

As the plant's roots grow, they can exert pressure on the soil particles that make up the driveway, causing them to break apart and erode. Over time, this can lead to the deterioration of the dirt driveway.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because bird feathers are not typically related to weathering, unless they are subject to significant exposure to the elements over a long period of time. Option (B) is incorrect because human legs have no direct relationship to weathering. Option (D) is incorrect because while ocean waves can certainly cause weathering of coastal rock formations, they do not directly relate to the weathering of a plant laying down roots."
