The Tesla Model S is an electric vehicle, which means it runs on electricity and produces zero tailpipe emissions. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. \n\nOption (A), the semi truck, typically runs on diesel fuel and emits a significant amount of pollutants, making it a less environmentally friendly choice. Option (C), the Ford Explorer, and option (D), the Toyota Tundra, are both gasoline-powered vehicles and produce emissions from their tailpipes. While they may have better fuel efficiency or emit less pollution compared to older models, they still contribute to air pollution.\n\nIt's important to note that the overall environmental impact of a vehicle goes beyond just tailpipe emissions and may include factors such as manufacturing, energy source for charging, and lifecycle analysis. However, based solely on the information provided in the question, the Tesla Model S is the vehicle that would make less pollution."
