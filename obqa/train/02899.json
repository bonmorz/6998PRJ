The desert rat's ability to live with low supplies of water is an example of an acquired characteristic. Acquired characteristics are traits that an organism develops during its lifetime as a result of its environment or behavior. In this case, the desert rat has evolved traits that allow it to survive in a water-scarce environment over time. Option (A) is incorrect because acquired heuristics refer to problem-solving strategies developed through experience and learning. Option (C) is unrelated to the concept of acquired traits.
