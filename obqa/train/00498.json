Option (A), wearing layers, can help prevent blisters by reducing friction between the skin and the shoe.

Option (B), running barefoot, may actually increase the risk of blisters due to increased friction and lack of protection. Option (C), walking instead of running, does not address the question of preventing blisters while running.

Blisters are often caused by friction between the skin and the inside of our shoes. Option (A), wearing layers, can help prevent blisters by creating a barrier between the shoe and the skin. This could be achieved by wearing double socks or using blister prevention products like moleskin. \n\nOptions (B), running barefoot, and (C), walking instead, would not prevent blisters. In fact, running barefoot might increase the risk of blisters as the feet are directly exposed to friction with the ground. Walking instead of running may reduce the intensity of friction but may not eliminate it completely.\n\nOption (D), wearing sandals, might prevent blisters if the sandals were designed to provide proper support and not cause friction. However, this option is not as effective as option (A) because sandals may still allow some movement and rubbing of the foot against the shoe material.\n\nTherefore, option (A), wearing layers, is the best choice for preventing blisters when running."
