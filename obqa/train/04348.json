The white object that is visible due to being close to Earth is our Moon, so the correct answer is (D). Option (A) is incorrect because Venus, although visible from Earth, is not always white and its visibility is not solely due to its proximity to Earth. Option (B) is incorrect because although Mars can sometimes appear white in the sky, its visibility is not solely due to its proximity to Earth. Option (C) is incorrect because Neptune is not visible to the naked eye from Earth."
