These bodies of water provide a source of moisture, which can lead to the formation of clouds and rain. Therefore, it is most likely to rain at a seaside resort. Option (A) is incorrect because New Mexico is known for its dry climate and receives less rainfall compared to other regions. Option (C) is also incorrect because deserts generally have low levels of precipitation. Option (D) is a common saying, but rain on one's wedding day is not more likely than any other day."

This is because seaside resorts are located near large bodies of water, such as oceans or lakes, which provide a source of moisture. The proximity to water increases the chances of rainfall. Option (A), in the state of New Mexico, is less likely to experience rain because New Mexico is known for its dry climate. Option (C), at a cabin in the desert, is also unlikely to see much rainfall due to the arid nature of deserts. Option (D), on one's wedding day, is a humorous option and not related to meteorology."
