Option (A) is incorrect because fire extinguishers are used to suppress or put out fires. Option (B) is incorrect because water is also used to extinguish fires by cooling and smothering the flames. Option (C) is incorrect because smothering refers to suffocating or depriving the fire of oxygen, which would put it out rather than prolong it. Option (D), candle wax, is the correct answer. Candle wax is a flammable substance that provides fuel for the fire, allowing it to continue burning."
