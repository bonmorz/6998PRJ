Water vapor can condense on a colder surface, forming droplets. Option (D) suggests a cold drink, which would have a lower temperature than the surrounding air. Therefore, it is likely to catch airborne water vapor on its sides.\n\nOption (A) states \"jail cells,\" which does not provide any indication of temperature or surface properties. Therefore, it cannot be determined if jail cells would catch airborne water vapor.\n\nOption (B) states \"sunlight,\" which is not a physical object that can catch water vapor. Sunlight does not have physical sides or surfaces to interact with water vapor.\n\nOption (C) suggests a hot drink, which has a higher temperature than the surrounding air. Hot surfaces are less likely to condense water vapor because the temperature difference is smaller. Therefore, a hot drink is less likely to catch airborne water vapor compared to a cold drink."
