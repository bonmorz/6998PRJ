The water cycle is a natural process that involves the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. The first stage of the water cycle is evaporation, where water changes from a liquid state to a gaseous state (water vapor). This option is correct because it accurately describes the first stage of the water cycle. Options (B), (C), and (D) are unrelated to the water cycle and can be eliminated."
