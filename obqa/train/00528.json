Insects that exhibit complete metamorphosis, like bees and ants, have a distinct adult stage where they lay eggs. The adult stage of these insects is often represented by the queen, who is responsible for laying eggs and continuing the life cycle of the colony. Option (A) is incorrect because not all insects lay eggs during their adult stage; some have different reproductive strategies. Option (B) is a vague term that does not specify a particular type of insect. Option (D) is incorrect because males of most insect species do not lay eggs."
