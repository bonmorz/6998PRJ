It works by emitting sound waves and then measuring the time it takes for those sound waves to bounce back after hitting an object. This information allows the user to determine the distance and location of the object. Option (B) is incorrect because sonar does not specifically identify the elements of an object, only its location. Options (C) and (D) are also incorrect because sonar is not used to find minerals or determine mass."
