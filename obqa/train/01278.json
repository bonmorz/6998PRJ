The process of a stone being weathered into sand is a gradual one that takes a significant amount of time.

Option (D) is incorrect because a fortnight (two weeks) is still not enough time for a stone to be weathered into sand. Option (A) is the correct answer because it suggests a longer time frame, indicating that the process of weathering takes thousands of years."
