Camouflage helps animals blend in with their surroundings, making it easier for them to approach their prey without being detected. Option (A) is incorrect because animals cannot use trees for hunting, they can only use trees as a part of their camouflage. Option (C) is incorrect because air is not something animals can camouflage in. Option (D) is incorrect because although some animals use camouflage in water, the question specifically asks for hunting, so the correct answer is option (B) - meals, referring to the animals that the predator is hunting for food."
