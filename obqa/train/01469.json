Cucumbers contain carbohydrates and other nutrients that can be converted into energy by the body. Option (B), going running, can also provide energy through the conversion of stored energy in the body, but it requires more effort and time compared to simply eating a cucumber. Option (C), eating dust, is not a viable option as dust does not provide any nutritional value or energy. Option (D), going swimming, can also provide energy through physical activity and is a good option for overall fitness, but it is not as straightforward as eating a cucumber to quickly obtain energy."
