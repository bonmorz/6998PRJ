The number of body parts an organism is born with is determined by its creators, which can refer to the genetic information inherited from its parents. The genetic makeup of an organism determines its physical characteristics, including the number of body parts it has.\n\nOption (A), survival of the fittest, does not directly determine the number of body parts an organism is born with. Survival of the fittest refers to the idea that individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce. It is related to natural selection rather than the initial development of body parts.\n\nOption (B), random chance, may play a role in the development of some variations or mutations in an organism's body parts, but it does not solely determine the overall number of body parts an organism is born with.\n\nOption (D), natural predators, also does not determine the number of body parts an organism is born with. Natural predators may influence the survival and reproductive success of individuals with certain body parts, but they do not determine the initial number of body parts an organism is born with."
