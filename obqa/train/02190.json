Option (D) is the correct answer because replacing their driving to work with biking is a way to reduce the pollution caused by their vehicle emissions. Biking is a form of sustainable transportation that does not release harmful emissions into the environment. \n\nOptions (A) and (B) may seem plausible, but they are not directly focused on reducing an individual's pollution levels. Selling bikes to commuters (option A) may encourage others to reduce their pollution levels, but it does not directly impact the individual in question. Going on a biking tour of the country (option B) is a recreational activity that may reduce pollution by not using a vehicle, but it does not address the individual's daily commuting habits.\n\nOption (C), going on a biking tour of the city, also seems plausible, but it is not as effective in reducing pollution levels as option (D). While biking around the city may reduce some pollution from the individual's vehicle emissions, it does not address the primary source of pollution, which is the individual's commute to work. Therefore, option (D) is the most effective choice for reducing pollution levels as it directly addresses the individual's daily driving habits."
