Graphite is a form of carbon that is commonly used in pencils because of its ability to leave a mark on paper. As a result, you would most likely find graphite in a visual art class, where students often use pencils for drawing and sketching. The other options are not related to the use of graphite. In a yoga class (option A), there is no need for graphite. In a philosophy class (option B), graphite is not typically used for any philosophical discussions or activities. In a physical education class (option C), students engage in physical activities, so there is no need for graphite."
