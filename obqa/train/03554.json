Puppies, like many other animals, have natural instincts to seek nourishment from their parents, and this behavior is driven by their instinctual need for food. Option (A) is incorrect because the behavior is not learned or acquired through experience. Option (C) is incorrect because it implies a response to a specific stimulus, rather than an innate behavior. Option (D) is incorrect because predatory behavior typically involves hunting and capturing prey, which is not relevant to the scenario described."
