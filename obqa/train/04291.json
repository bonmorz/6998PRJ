Monitor lizards are ectothermic animals, meaning they rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. Option (D) is correct because if a monitor lizard leaves a rainy forest and moves to a sunny desert, the increased exposure to sunlight and higher ambient temperature will cause its body temperature to increase. Option (A) is incorrect because going into a hole underground would provide shade and cooler temperatures, causing the lizard's body temperature to decrease. Option (B) is also incorrect because hiding under a tree may provide partial shade but not enough heat to increase body temperature.
