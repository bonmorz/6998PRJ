When the population of a prey species, such as zebras, decreases, it leads to a decrease in the available food source for predators like African wild dogs. This causes increased competition among the predators for the limited food supply, hence option (A) is correct. Option (B) is unrelated and not supported by any information provided. Option (C) is incorrect because a decrease in the population of zebras would not directly cause an increase in the prey communities. Option (D) is incorrect because even with a decrease in zebra population, prey may still hide or camouflage themselves to avoid predators."
