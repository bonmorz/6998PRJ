When we plant native plants, they have a positive impact on the territory or ecosystem. Native plants are adapted to the local climate and soil conditions, so they are more likely to thrive and provide habitat for native wildlife. Option (A) is unrelated to planting native plants. Option (C) might seem like a potential answer, but it is not as directly related to planting native plants as option (B). Option (D) might be indirectly related, as a healthy ecosystem can support local economies, but it is not as direct as option (B)."

Native plants are adapted to the specific environmental conditions of a region, which helps support biodiversity and the overall health of the ecosystem. They provide food and habitat for native animals, help prevent soil erosion, and can even support the pollinator population. Option (A) is incorrect because while planting native plants may have an indirect impact on local markets (such as supporting nurseries that sell native plants), it is not a direct impact. Option (C) is not related to planting native plants. Option (D) is also not directly related to planting native plants, as the economy is a larger scale concept that encompasses many factors beyond just planting native plants."
