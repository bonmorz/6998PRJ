Option (C) is incorrect because Tupperware is made out of plastic, which would melt and release toxic fumes when exposed to fire, but it would not easily catch fire and burn.

                "content": "To determine which option would be easier to burn, we need to consider the materials and properties of each item. \n\nOption (A), a park bench, is likely made of wood or a combination of wood and other materials. Wood is combustible, meaning it can easily catch fire and burn. Therefore, a park bench would be relatively easier to burn compared to the other options.\n\nOption (B), a silver spoon, is made of metal. Metals have a high melting and ignition point, meaning they require a significant amount of heat to burn. While it is technically possible to melt or burn a silver spoon with extremely high temperatures, it would be more difficult and require specialized equipment or conditions.\n\nOption (C), Tupperware, is typically made of a type of plastic called polypropylene. Plastics are generally not as combustible as wood, but they can burn if exposed to high heat or open flames. However, Tupperware is designed to be heat-resistant and is unlikely to catch fire easily. Burning Tupperware would require sustained exposure to high heat.\n\nOption (D), an airplane, is primarily made of metal, composite materials, and other non-combustible materials. Airplanes are designed to withstand high temperatures and fire hazards, and they are equipped with fire suppression systems for safety. Burning an airplane would be extremely difficult and would likely require extreme conditions or external factors such as a fuel leak or explosion.\n\nBased on these considerations, option (A), a park bench, would be the easiest to burn compared to the other options."
