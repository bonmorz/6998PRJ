Option (A) is the correct answer because introducing more water sources can provide a more favorable habitat for the organism, leading to increased reproduction and population growth. Water is essential for the survival and reproduction of many organisms. Option (B) is incorrect because restricting the food supply would likely lead to population decline rather than growth. Option (C) is incorrect because introducing more predators would actually decrease the population of the organism as they would be hunted and killed. Option (D) is incorrect because creating artificial drought conditions would also likely lead to a decrease in the population as the organism would struggle to survive without adequate water."
