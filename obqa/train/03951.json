The Earth's orbit around the Sun is elliptical, and as it moves closer to or farther away from the Sun, the intensity of sunlight received by different parts of the Earth's surface varies. This change in sunlight intensity and angle causes the seasons to change. \n\nOption (B) Venus, option (C) Saturn, and option (D) Mercury are incorrect because they are not the celestial body that the Earth orbits around. Venus and Mercury are other planets in our solar system, while Saturn is a gas giant. Only the Sun, referred to as a plasma star, is responsible for the Earth's seasons due to its gravitational pull and the varying angles of sunlight it provides throughout the year."
