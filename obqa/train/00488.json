                "content": "To answer this question, we need to consider the effects of heat and sunlight on a large boulder over a long period of time. With exposure to direct heat and sunlight, the boulder may undergo weathering and erosion. This can cause the surface of the boulder to become damaged, cracked, and worn down. Option (C) \"ravaged\" accurately describes the potential effects of direct heat and sunlight on a large boulder over time.\n\nOption (A) \"frozen\" is incorrect because heat and sunlight would not cause a large boulder to freeze. Freezing occurs at temperatures below the freezing point of water, and heat and sunlight would not lead to freezing temperatures.\n\nOption (B) \"catapulted\" is incorrect because heat and sunlight would not cause a large boulder to be launched or thrown through the air like a catapult. Catapulting typically involves a force or mechanism, such as a lever or elastic energy, and is not related to exposure to heat and sunlight.\n\nOption (D) \"rotted\" is incorrect because rotting typically refers to the decomposition of organic matter, such as plants or animals, by bacterial or fungal action. A large boulder is composed of inorganic minerals and rocks, and would not undergo the same processes of decay and decomposition as organic matter."
