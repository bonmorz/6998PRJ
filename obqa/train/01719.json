Life forms, including humans and other animals, break down the food they consume through a process called cellular respiration. This process involves the conversion of food molecules into energy molecules called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Option (B) is incorrect because food packaging does not have the ability to break down food. Option (C) is unrelated to the topic of breaking down food for energy. Option (D) is incorrect because the sun does not directly break down food for energy in living organisms."

In cellular respiration, organisms break down food (specifically glucose) in order to produce energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Option (A) is correct because life forms, such as humans and other organisms, break down food through digestion and cellular respiration to obtain energy. Option (B) is incorrect because food packaging is not involved in the process of breaking down food for energy. Option (C) is incorrect because refrigerators do not break down food; they are used to keep food cold and prevent spoilage.
