Option (D) is correct because plants require light energy for photosynthesis, which is the process that allows them to produce food. Indoors, there is often less light than outdoors, which can result in less chlorophyll being produced and therefore less light energy being absorbed. Option (A) is incorrect because temperature can be controlled indoors and there are many plants that can thrive in a range of temperatures. Option (B) is not necessarily true because some plants can thrive on their own. Option (C) is incorrect because roots primarily absorb water and nutrients, not light energy."

                "content": "This question requires knowledge about the requirements of plants for photosynthesis. Option (D) is correct because indoor environments generally have lower light intensity compared to outdoor environments. Since chlorophyll in plants uses light energy for photosynthesis, a plant may not receive enough light energy indoors, which can hinder its growth and overall health. Option (A) is incorrect because temperature can be controlled indoors and may not be a limiting factor for plant growth. Option (B) may be a factor in some cases, but it is not directly related to the plant's ability to thrive indoors. Option (C) is incorrect because roots do not absorb light energy, they absorb water and nutrients from the soil."

Option (A) is partly correct, as temperature can affect a plant's growth, but it is not the main reason why a plant would not do well indoors. Option (B) is incorrect because being near other plants is not necessary for a plant's survival. Option (C) is also incorrect because roots do not directly absorb light energy. \n\nThe correct answer is (D) - the chlorophyll has less light energy to absorb. When a plant is placed indoors, it may not receive as much sunlight as it would outdoors. Since chlorophyll is responsible for capturing light energy during photosynthesis, if there is insufficient light, the plant's ability to produce food and energy is reduced. This can result in weakened growth and overall poor health for the plant. Therefore, the lack of sufficient light energy for the chlorophyll to absorb is the main reason why a plant would not do well indoors."
