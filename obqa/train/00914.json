Boiling water at a water treatment plant is done to eliminate harmful substances and microorganisms that may be present in the water. Boiling water kills bacteria, viruses, and parasites, making it safe for consumption. Option (A) is incorrect because adding oxygen is not the reason for boiling water at a water treatment plant. Option (B) is also incorrect because boiling water does not add specific health benefits, it simply makes it safe to drink. Option (D) is incorrect because mixing water is not the primary purpose of boiling it at a water treatment plant."
