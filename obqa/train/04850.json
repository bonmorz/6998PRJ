In a plant such as a cactus, water is held within a series of tubes in the body. These tubes, known as vascular tissue or xylem, transport water from the roots to the rest of the plant. Option (A) is incorrect because the spikes on the stem of a cactus serve as a defense mechanism to deter predators and do not hold water. Option (B) is also incorrect because the lines on a stem typically represent the vascular bundles and not water storage. Option (C) is incorrect because cactus leaves are usually modified into spines and do not have water storage capabilities."
