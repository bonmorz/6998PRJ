A toad is an amphibian that typically lives in wet environments, such as forests. Therefore, it would have better hiding places on a forest floor where it can blend in with its surroundings, find foliage to hide under, and have access to moisture. Option (A) is incorrect because a house rooftop would not provide the necessary environment for a toad. Option (B) is also incorrect because a glass bottle would not be a suitable hiding place for a toad and would not provide the necessary conditions for its survival. Option (D) is unlikely and not a natural behavior for a toad."
