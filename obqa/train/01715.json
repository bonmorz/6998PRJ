This is due to the rotation of the Earth on its axis. As the Earth rotates, different stars come into view while others disappear below the horizon. The position of the stars in relation to the skyline appears to change throughout the night. Option (A) is incorrect because the moon itself appears to move, but the stars appear to move independently from it. Option (C) is also incorrect because the treetops are not a fixed reference point and do not affect our perception of star movement. Option (D) is incorrect because the stars' movement is independent of the ocean."
