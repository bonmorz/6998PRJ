Plants can use the wind as a pollinator, as their pollen can be carried in the air and transported from the male parts of the plant to the female parts of another plant. Option (A) is incorrect because beeswax is a substance produced by bees, but bees themselves are the pollinators, not the wax. Option (B) is incorrect because small extinct birds are not present in the current ecosystem and therefore cannot serve as pollinators.
