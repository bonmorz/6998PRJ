In an ecological context, a producer is an organism that is able to produce its own energy through processes like photosynthesis. This energy is then consumed by other organisms in the ecosystem, known as consumers. Option (C) is correct because external food eaters, or consumers, rely on producers as a source of energy. Options (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the relationship between a producer and other organisms in an ecosystem."
