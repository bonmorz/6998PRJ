Black is known for absorbing light, so a black bag would not reflect much light. Brown shoes would also likely absorb light rather than reflect it. A yellow shirt, on the other hand, is a lighter color and would reflect more light compared to the other options. A blue shirt would reflect some light, but not as much as a yellow shirt. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."

Therefore, option (A) is incorrect. Since yellow is a lighter color, it reflects more light than darker colors like blue and brown. Therefore, option (B) is correct. Option (C) reflects less light than yellow because it is a darker color. Option (D) is also incorrect because brown is a darker color and therefore reflects less light."

Option (C), a blue shirt, may reflect some light but not as much as yellow, as blue is generally a darker color. Option (D), brown shoes, can vary in color and shade, but generally brown is a darker color as well and will reflect less light than yellow. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."

A black bag, on the other hand, will absorb most of the light and reflect very little, making it appear darker.
