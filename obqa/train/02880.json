Louis Pasteur was a French scientist known for his discoveries in microbiology and the process of pasteurization. Pasteurization is the process of heating a liquid to kill bacteria and other microorganisms, thus extending its shelf life. Strawberry milk is a beverage that relies on pasteurized milk as one of its key ingredients. Therefore, we can thank Louis Pasteur for making strawberry milk possible.
