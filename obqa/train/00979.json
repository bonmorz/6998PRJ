Aloe (option C) is a succulent plant that typically grows in a fixed location and does not move. \n\nOn the other hand, a tortoise (option D) is a reptile that is capable of moving from one location to another. Tortoises have legs and are able to walk, albeit at a slow pace. They can change their position by moving to different areas within their habitat or even over long distances.

Trees, including pine trees, are rooted in the ground and cannot change their position. Therefore, option (A) is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\nOption (B) carrot refers to a root vegetable. Carrots, like other root vegetables, grow underground and are also not capable of changing their position. Therefore, option (B) is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\nOption (C) aloe refers to a type of succulent plant with thick, fleshy leaves. While aloe plants do not have the capability to move on their own, they can grow and spread new shoots in different directions. However, this growth is relatively slow and limited compared to other organisms. Therefore, option (C) is less likely to be the correct answer.\n\nOption (D) tortoise refers to a type of reptile. Tortoises have limbs and are capable of moving on land. They can walk and even crawl depending on the terrain. Therefore, option (D) is the most likely answer as tortoises have the ability to change their position compared to the other options.\n\nIn conclusion, the life form most likely to have changed its position is a tortoise (option D)."
