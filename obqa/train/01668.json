Raptors are a group of birds that includes eagles, hawks, and owls, which are known for their hunting skills. The other options are not natural predators of shrews. Horses are herbivores, meaning they eat plants and not other animals. Butterflies are insects and generally feed on nectar from flowers. Deer are also herbivores and primarily eat plants."
