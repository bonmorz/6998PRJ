An inflatable toy, such as a balloon, is filled with a gas that is less dense than the surrounding air. This causes the toy to be buoyant and float in the air for a longer period of time compared to the other options. Option (A) is incorrect because an iron throne is a solid object and does not have the same buoyancy as a gas-filled toy. Option (B) is also incorrect because a rock is heavy and will fall to the ground. Option (C) is not directly related to buoyancy and is not a relevant option."
