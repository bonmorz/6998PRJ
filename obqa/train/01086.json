When we engage in physical activity like playing basketball, our body temperature rises. To cool itself down, the body begins to sweat, which causes the skin to become wet. This helps to regulate body temperature. Option (A) is correct because it explains the physiological response of the body to lower its temperature. Option (B) is incorrect because a fast heart rate may be a result of physical activity, but it is not related to the skin becoming wet and smelly. Option (C) is incorrect because if the body is too cold, it would not start sweating excessively. Option (D) is unrelated to the physiological process of sweating."
