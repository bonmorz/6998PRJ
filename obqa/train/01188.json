Lizards are known to be able to live in environments that may be lacking in moisture. They have developed various adaptations that allow them to survive in dry habitats. Option (A) is incorrect because lizards, like other organisms, require oxygen to survive. Option (C) is unrelated because lizards are not known to live in zero gravity environments. Option (D) is not entirely accurate because lizards still require some form of food, but they can survive in environments that may not have an abundant food supply."
