Sickness has the potential to eliminate an organism because it can weaken the body's immune system and make it more vulnerable to infections or diseases that can ultimately lead to death. Option (A) is incorrect because while sickness can sometimes lead to the strengthening of the immune system, it can also have the opposite effect. Option (B) is close, but not entirely accurate because sickness is not specifically designed to test an organism. Option (D) is not related to the effects of sickness on an organism."
