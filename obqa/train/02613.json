Energy transfer occurs when energy is transmitted from one object or system to another. \n\nOption (A) states that a tire would be unable to transfer energy. This is because a tire is a passive object and does not have the ability to transmit or transfer energy on its own. It may store potential energy (such as when it is compressed), but it cannot actively transfer that energy to another object or system.\n\nOptions (B), (C), and (D) mention materials like copper, metal, and iron. These materials are all conductive and have free electrons that can move and transfer energy. Therefore, they are capable of transferring energy. \n\nHence, the correct answer is (A) a tire."
