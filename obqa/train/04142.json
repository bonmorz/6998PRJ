Brackish water is water that is a mixture of fresh water and salt water, typically found in estuaries where rivers meet the sea. Option (D), H2O, refers to water, which is the main component of brackish water. Option (A), water wheels, is incorrect because water wheels are not typically found in estuaries and do not relate to the salinity of the water. Option (B), fish, is partially correct because certain fish can live in brackish water, but it does not encompass all of the aspects of brackish water. Option (C), air, is incorrect because the salinity of the water in an estuary does not directly affect the air."
