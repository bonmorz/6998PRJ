When a person looks at their head in a mirror and moves closer to the mirror, their head will appear to grow larger. This happens because as the person gets closer to the mirror, the distance between their head and the mirror decreases. When light reflects off the mirror and enters our eyes, it creates the illusion that our head is larger because the reflected image is closer to our eyes. Option (B) is incorrect because the head does not disappear, it just appears larger. Option (C) is incorrect because as the person moves closer to the mirror, their head appears larger, not smaller. Option (D) is incorrect because there is no physical explosion occurring when looking at one's head in a mirror."
