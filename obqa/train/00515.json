Aluminum is a versatile metal that is commonly used in a variety of industries, such as transportation, packaging, and construction. It is lightweight, strong, and resistant to corrosion, making it a valuable material for various purposes. Therefore, if the miner wants to find rocks that can be used for purposes other than building, looking for rocks with aluminum would be the best choice.\n\nOption (B) states that the miner should look for rocks with sand. Sand is a granular material consisting of tiny particles of various minerals and rock fragments. While sand is used in construction for making concrete and mortar, it is primarily a building material rather than something with a wide range of purposes.\n\nOption (C) states that the miner should look for rocks with \"roxys.\" However, \"roxys\" is not a recognized term or material, so it is an incorrect option.\n\nOption (D) states that the miner should look for rocks with pearl. While pearls are beautiful gemstones that are prized for their luster and color, they are not found in rocks. Pearls are formed inside the shells of certain mollusks, such as oysters, and are not associated with rocks. Therefore, option (D) is also incorrect.\n\nOverall, the best choice for the miner to look for rocks with would be aluminum, as it is a versatile material with numerous applications outside of building."
