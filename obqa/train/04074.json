The information states that the days are more chilled than before, but still avoid freezing degrees.

While it is possible that shorter nights could contribute to a more chilled day, this is not a necessary assumption based solely on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) - daylight has lessened. Since the days are more chilled but still avoiding freezing, it suggests that there is less daylight, resulting in lower temperatures. With less daylight, there is less time for the sun to heat up the environment, leading to colder days."
