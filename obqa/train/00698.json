Kinetic energy refers to the energy an object possesses due to its motion. When using a bicycle, potential energy (such as the energy stored in the person's muscles) is converted into kinetic energy as the person pedals and the bicycle moves. Option (A) is incorrect because using a computer does not involve any significant conversion of energy between potential and kinetic forms. Option (B) is incorrect because a light bulb converts electrical energy into light energy, not potential energy into kinetic energy. Option (C) is incorrect because using a television also does not involve any significant conversion of energy between potential and kinetic forms."
