Decomposition is the process by which organic matter is broken down into simpler substances, usually by the action of bacteria and fungi. This allows the nutrients in the organic matter to be recycled back into the environment. Option (B) is incorrect because freezing in time implies a lack of change or decay, which is not a natural process. Option (C) is incorrect because after death, things do not become lively, as life refers to the state of being alive. Option (D) is incorrect because while regeneration can occur in some organisms, it is not a universal outcome after death."
