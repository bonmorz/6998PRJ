A landfill is a method of waste disposal in which garbage, trash, and other waste materials are buried. As a result, it is likely to cause an increase in loose detritus in the area. The waste materials in the landfill can easily get dispersed by wind or animals, leading to an accumulation of loose debris in the surrounding area. Option (B) is incorrect because landfills are known to release harmful gases and pollutants into the air, leading to poorer air quality. Option (C) is unlikely because landfills are often perceived as undesirable and can have a negative impact on property values. Option (D) is also unlikely because the presence of a landfill can generate unpleasant odors and attract pests, which would not contribute to a nicer community."
