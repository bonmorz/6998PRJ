Birds play a crucial role in spreading the seeds of plants, including oak trees. When birds consume fruits or berries, they later excrete the seeds in different locations, helping plants to colonize new areas. Option (A) is incorrect because wind is responsible for wind dispersal, not birds. Option (B) is not related to seed dispersal and is more related to human behavior.
