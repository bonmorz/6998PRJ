Steel is a conductor of heat, meaning it allows heat to travel through it easily. Therefore, the steel spoon in the cafeteria would let the most heat travel through. Option (A), cotton candy, is a poor conductor of heat and would not allow much heat to travel through. Option (B), jeans, can vary depending on the material but generally, denim is not a good conductor of heat. Option (D), a cotton hat, is also a poor conductor of heat and would not allow much heat to pass through."
