This is because exhaust consists of gases which are highly volatile and can easily disperse in the air. When a car is running, the exhaust gases are released into the environment and quickly spread out due to wind and air currents. \n\nOption (B), windshield fluid from a car, is less likely to spread as quickly as exhaust. While windshield fluid is a liquid, it is not as volatile as gases. It may spread if it is sprayed onto the windshield and flows down due to gravity, but it is less likely to disperse quickly in the air.\n\nOption (C), metal from a car, is unlikely to spread at all. Metal is a solid material and does not have the ability to spread like a gas or liquid. Metal from a car would remain in its solid form and not disperse like the other substances.\n\nOption (D), water from a car, could potentially spread in certain situations. If water is spilled or leaks from a car, it can flow and spread depending on the surface it is on or the slope of the ground. However, it would not spread as rapidly as exhaust gases, as water is a heavier substance and does not evaporate and disperse as quickly.\n\nIn conclusion, exhaust from a car would likely spread the fastest due to its volatile nature and ability to disperse as a gas."

Windshield fluid (option B) is a liquid and may spread but not as quickly as a gas. Metal (option C) is a solid and does not typically spread as it is rigid and does not flow easily.

Metal from a car would not spread at all, as it would remain in its solid state and not disperse.\n\nOption (D) water from a car is a liquid, and while it has the potential to spread, it would likely spread slower than exhaust.

While these particles could be carried by wind if they were lightweight enough, they are more likely to settle and not spread as quickly as gases or liquids.\n\nOption (D), water from a car, is a liquid.
