The reactants present in a chemical reaction combine to form new products with different chemical properties. Option (A) is incorrect because while chemical reactions can be influenced by temperature, they are not the cause of new formations of temperatures themselves. Option (B) is incorrect because the shape of an object is determined by its physical properties, not chemical reactions. Option (C) is also incorrect because while some chemical reactions may result in a change in color, this is not a general characteristic of all chemical reactions."
