Dry brush accumulation can increase the risk of wildfires, and a lit cigar left by a camper could potentially start a fire. Deer are sensitive to changes in their environment and would likely leave their habitat to escape the danger of a wildfire. Option (A) is incorrect because a light rain would not make the habitat unlivable for a deer. Option (B) is unrelated to the normal behavior of deer and is unlikely to be a reason for leaving its habitat.
