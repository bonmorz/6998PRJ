Arctic land is characterized by extreme cold temperatures and a lack of vegetation, which limits the number of living things that can survive in this environment.

Arctic land is characterized by extremely cold temperatures, permafrost, and limited vegetation and animal life. On the other hand, jungle land is lush, dense, and teeming with a wide variety of plants and animal species.\n\nSince the question specifically asks about \"an acre\" of land, we can assume that we're comparing equal areas. In this case, an acre of arctic land will have fewer living things, life forms, and organisms compared to an acre of jungle land. The extreme conditions of the arctic make it difficult for many species to survive, resulting in a lower diversity and abundance of life forms.\n\nOption (A), (B), and (C) suggest that the arctic land would have more living things, life forms, or organisms, which is incorrect based on our understanding of the respective ecosystems.
