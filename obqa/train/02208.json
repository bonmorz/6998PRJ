When a bucket full of water is left outside on a warm day, the heat causes the water to evaporate. Evaporation is the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas and rises into the atmosphere.

Option (A) is incorrect because the material of the bucket is not relevant to the question. Option (B) is incorrect because the bucket itself does not disappear.
