A bird of prey may avoid being spotted by altering its hues to blend in with its surroundings, such as the leaves. Option (A) is incorrect because birds of prey do not typically hunt and eat predators that are larger than themselves. Option (B) is unlikely to be effective as simply closing its eyes would not necessarily prevent it from being spotted. Option (D) is not specific to avoiding being spotted and is more related to escaping from a predator once it has been spotted."

Option (C) is the correct answer because many animals, including birds, can change their body coloration or patterns to blend in with their environment.
