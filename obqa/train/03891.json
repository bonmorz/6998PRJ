Whales are large marine mammals and are unlikely to be residing in a hollowed out part of a tree, so option (A) can be eliminated. Antelopes are terrestrial animals that typically live in open grasslands or woodlands, so it is highly unlikely that they would be residing in a hollowed out part of a tree. Therefore, option (B) can also be eliminated. Humans, represented by option (C), generally live in houses or other artificial structures, so living in a hollowed out part of a tree is unlikely for them as well. Option (C) can also be eliminated. \n\nScavengers, represented by option (D), are a group of organisms that feed on dead or decaying organic matter. There are scavengers such as insects, birds, and mammals that often take shelter or find food sources in hollowed out parts of trees. Therefore, if there is something residing in a hollowed out part of a tree, it is most likely to be a scavenger."
