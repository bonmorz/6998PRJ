Option (A) is incorrect because having a space between their toes does not directly contribute to their swimming ability. Option (B) is partially correct, as ducks are indeed buoyant and resilient in the water, but this does not solely explain their swimming ability. Option (C) is inaccurate because the width of their feet alone does not determine their swimming ability."
