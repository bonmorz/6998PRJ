After a Meyer tree's flower petals drop, you are left with something sweet. Meyer trees produce a type of citrus fruit called Meyer lemons. The flowers of the tree serve the purpose of pollination, and once they drop their petals, the fruit begins to develop. Option (A) is incorrect because a bee sign has no relevance to the flowers dropping from a Meyer tree. Option (C) is unrelated because a bird bath is not a result of the flower petals dropping. Option (D) is unrelated because a party is not a result of the flowers dropping, but rather a social event unrelated to the tree's life cycle."
