Seasonal changes, such as the change from summer to autumn or winter to spring, are made in response to changes in geographical locations or locales. These changes are primarily influenced by factors such as the tilt of the Earth's axis and its orbit around the sun. Option (A) is incorrect because mentality does not directly influence seasonal changes. Option (B) is incorrect because buildings do not have a direct impact on seasonal changes.
