Birds use their beaks for various purposes, such as eating, drinking, defending themselves, building nests, and manipulating objects. Similarly, birds use their feet for various functions, including walking, perching, grasping objects, and even hunting. Some birds, such as parrots, use their feet as an additional tool to assist in eating by holding and manipulating food. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) feet, as birds use their beaks and feet for similar purposes. Options (A) eggs, (B) feathers, and (D) wings are unrelated to the functions of a bird's beak."

Some birds use their beaks for the same purpose as their feet, which is to grasp and manipulate objects. Birds use their beaks to pick up and handle food, build nests, and groom themselves, just like they use their feet for these purposes. Option (A) is incorrect because birds do not use their beaks for the same purpose as their eggs. Option (B) is incorrect because feathers serve different functions than beaks. Feathers help birds with flight, insulation, and display, among other things. Option (D) is incorrect because wings are used for flying, while beaks are used for manipulating objects."

Birds use their beaks for various purposes, including eating, drinking, preening their feathers, and building nests.

Some birds, such as certain species of shorebirds, use their beaks to probe and search for food in the mud or sand. Similarly, they also use their feet to search and forage for food. So, the beak and feet serve the same purpose of finding and obtaining food.
