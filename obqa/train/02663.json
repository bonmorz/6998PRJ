Options (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect as they do not accurately reflect the natural behavior of bears. Option (B) suggests that bears only eat, which is false as they do need to hunt and catch their prey. Option (C) states that bears never kill, which is also false as hunting and killing other animals is necessary for their survival. Option (D) describes bears as \"docile,\" which means gentle and easygoing, but this does not align with their behavior in the wild as they are apex predators."
