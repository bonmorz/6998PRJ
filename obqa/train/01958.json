Therefore, it is likely to have very little vegetation and food available. Option (A) is incorrect because arid regions can have rocks, but they are characterized by a lack of water and vegetation. Option (B) is also incorrect because arid regions are known for their high temperatures. Option (D) is incorrect because while arid regions can have sand, the lack of food is a more significant characteristic. Therefore, (C) is the correct answer."
