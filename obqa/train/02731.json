Option (A) is unrelated to migration. Option (B) is a specific type of animal that participates in migration, but it does not specify the time period.

Option (A) is unrelated to migration and is incorrect. Option (B) is true in general, as birds are known for their long-distance migrations, but it does not provide information about the specific time segment mentioned in the question. Option (C) is incorrect because spring is typically associated with northward migrations, as animals move towards more suitable breeding grounds.

Birds, especially those from the northern states, tend to migrate to warmer regions during the winter months to escape the colder conditions and scarcity of resources in their breeding grounds. Texas, being a southern state, offers more favorable conditions for birds during the winter, such as milder temperatures and abundant food sources.\n\nOption (A) \"lake fronts\" is incorrect because it does not specify a particular time segment related to migration.
