Birds feed their babies by regurgitation, which means they bring up partially digested food from their own stomachs and transfer it to the mouths of their young. Option (A) is incorrect because telepathy refers to the communication of thoughts without using physical senses, and it is not how birds feed their babies. Option (B) is incorrect because flying is the method birds use for transportation, not for feeding their babies. Option (C) is incorrect because osmosis is the movement of water across a semi-permeable membrane and is not related to bird feeding behavior."
