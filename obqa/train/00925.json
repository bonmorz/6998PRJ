Option (A), smashing it, involves a force that can physically deform or break the object, thereby changing its shape and potentially altering its mass.

Option (C), rolling it, would also not necessarily change its shape or mass unless it encounters another force or undergoes deformation during the rolling process.

Option (A), smashing it, would definitely change both the shape and mass of an object. When an object is smashed, it is likely to become deformed and its mass may change if pieces break off or are scattered. Option (B), tossing it, may change its position but typically would not change its shape or mass significantly. Option (C), rolling it, may change its position or orientation but would not generally alter its shape or mass. Option (D), touching it, would not necessarily change the shape or mass of an object unless it was applied with significant force. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer."
