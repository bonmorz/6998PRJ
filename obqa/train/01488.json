When there are heavy rains, the pond fills up with water, causing it to swell and flood.

Option (A) and (B) are incorrect because they suggest that the pond takes up very little or almost no space, which contradicts the information given in the question. Option (C) is also incorrect because it suggests that the pond takes up a smaller minority, implying that it occupies a smaller portion than before, which is not true."
