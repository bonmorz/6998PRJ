In this case, Jerry added salt (the solute) into tap water (the solvent) and stirred it up. When salt is added to water and stirred, it dissolves and forms a solution. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) a solution.\n\nOption (B) a battery is incorrect because a battery is a device that produces electrical energy, and it is not related to the process of dissolving.\n\nOption (C) sea water is not correct in this context because sea water is naturally occurring and contains various dissolved substances, not just salt in tap water. \n\nOption (D) lemonade is also incorrect because lemonade is a flavored drink made by mixing lemon juice, water, and sugar, and it is not related to the process of dissolving salt in water."
