This is because the light from the flashlight will typically reflect off the shiny diamond (option A), the metal sphere (option C), and the glistening icicle (option D), making them more visible. However, the dark color of a spider can blend in with the darkness surrounding it, making it harder to perceive in the flashlight's beam."
