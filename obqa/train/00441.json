Option (B) is the correct answer because living organisms require a source of energy to propel them forward and carry out life processes.

Option (C) is incorrect because hope is a concept that exists in the realm of human emotions and is not a requirement for all living organisms. Option (D) is incorrect because considering what to do is a cognitive process and is not a fundamental requirement for all living organisms."
