When the moon, sun, and earth line up, their gravitational forces combine and create higher tides, known as spring tides. These tides are at their maximum height. Option (A) is incorrect because the happiness of tides is subjective and not relevant.

When the moon, sun, and earth line up in a straight line (known as a syzygy), the gravitational pull from both the moon and the sun on the earth is at its maximum. This alignment causes higher high tides (known as spring tides) and lower low tides as the gravitational pull is stronger, resulting in a greater difference between high and low tide levels. Therefore, the correct answer is option (B) - tides are at their maximum during this alignment. Option (A) is not correct because tides are not influenced by emotions. Option (C) is incorrect because when the moon, sun, and earth line up, the gravitational pull is stronger, resulting in higher tides. Option (D) is incorrect because the alignment of the moon, sun, and earth does not result in a middle tide level; it instead causes more extreme tides."
