Animals often use camouflage to blend in with their surroundings in order to protect themselves from predators. By appearing the same as their surroundings, animals are less likely to be detected by predators, increasing their chances of survival. Option (A) is incorrect because nesting right beside predators would actually increase the animal's vulnerability to being eaten. Option (B) is incorrect because standing out in the sun would not provide protection from predators. Option (C) is also incorrect because standing out from the environment would make the animal more visible and increase its risk of being hunted."
