Among the given options, an earthquake is the event that quickly changes the Earth's surface. Earthquakes occur due to the sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust, resulting in violent shaking and movement of the ground. They can cause significant changes in the Earth's surface, such as the creation of new fault lines, formation of sinkholes, and even altering the course of rivers. The other options (A) a hurricane, (C) a flood, and (D) a tornado can also cause some changes to the Earth's surface, but they are not as immediate or impactful as an earthquake."

Option (B) is the correct answer because an earthquake can cause the ground to shake and shift, resulting in significant changes to the Earth's surface. Option (A) is incorrect because while a hurricane can cause damage and erosion, it does not typically cause immediate and dramatic changes to the Earth's surface. Option (C) is incorrect because a flood can cause erosion and change the landscape over time, but it does not typically cause immediate and rapid changes. Option (D) is incorrect because while a tornado can cause destruction and change to the immediate area it passes over, it does not typically cause widespread and significant changes to the Earth's surface."
