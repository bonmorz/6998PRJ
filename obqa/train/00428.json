Electric cars are powered by electricity, and depending on the source of that electricity, they can produce significantly lower CO2 emissions than gasoline-powered cars. Option (A) is incorrect because electric cars produce less or no CO2 emissions. Option (B) is incorrect because electric cars have lower CO2 emissions. Option (C) is incorrect because electric cars do not produce electric emissions, but rather use electricity as a clean energy source."
