A seismograph is a tool specifically designed for measuring seismic activity, such as earthquakes. It is capable of detecting and measuring the size or magnitude of seismic waves. Therefore, option (B) is correct because seismographs are used to measure terra plate displacements, which is essentially the movement of tectonic plates during seismic events. Option (A) is incorrect because seismographs do not measure the size of trees. Option (C) is incorrect because seismographs are not used to measure the size of planets. Option (D) is incorrect because seismographs do not measure the size of poems, as poems are a form of literary expression unrelated to seismic activity."
