Option (A) is the correct answer because animals feeling more comfortable being outside is a common behavior observed in migratory animals.

Option (C) is also incorrect because increased aggression is not directly related to migration.

Migratory behavior refers to the movement of animals from one region to another, typically in response to changes in food availability, climate, or breeding patterns.\n\nOption (A) animals feeling more comfortable being outside is not indicative of migratory behavior. Feeling more comfortable outside may be a result of environmental factors, but it does not necessarily involve movement to a new location.\n\nOption (B) animals getting more sick is not related to migratory behavior. Getting sick may be a result of various factors such as disease or environmental toxins, but it does not involve the movement from one region to another.\n\nOption (C) animals getting more aggressive is not a migratory outcome. Aggression in animals can be influenced by factors such as territoriality or mating behavior, but it does not involve migration.\n\nOption (D) animals dying from sub-zero weather may be a result of migration. Some animals migrate to avoid harsh winter conditions and find more favorable habitats. Migration allows them to find food, water, and suitable temperatures. Therefore, Option (D) is not the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) animals feeling more comfortable being outside.
