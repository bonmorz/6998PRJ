They are living organisms and do not produce radiation on their own.\n\nOption (B) - Grass: Grass does not have high levels of radiation. Plants do receive a small amount of radiation from the sun, but it is not significant compared to other sources.\n\nOption (C) - Water: Water, in its natural state, does not have high levels of radiation. However, there are sources of water that may have higher levels of radiation, such as contaminated groundwater, but this is not applicable to all water sources.\n\nOption (D) - Cigarettes: Cigarettes contain tobacco, which naturally contains radioactive materials. When tobacco is burned, these radioactive materials are released into the smoke. Therefore, cigarettes have higher levels of radiation compared to the other options.\n\nBased on this information, option (D) - cigarettes - is the correct answer as it is more likely to have higher levels of radiation compared to cats, grass, and water."
