When a home is being demolished, it means that it is being completely destroyed or torn down. In such a situation, it would not be safe or possible for humans to continue living in that home, so they would have to flee or leave. Option (A) is incorrect because if a home is being built, humans would not need to flee, rather they would be moving into the newly constructed home. Option (B) is incorrect because if a home is being painted, it does not necessarily require humans to leave unless there are specific reasons related to health or safety. Option (D) is incorrect because if a home is being prepared, it could refer to various activities such as cleaning or organizing, which would not require humans to flee."

Option (D) is incorrect because if a home is being prepared, it means that it is being made ready for use, and humans do not need to flee.
