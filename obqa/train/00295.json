When an electrical current is running through a wire, it can generate heat due to resistance. Therefore, if a wire is hot to the touch, it indicates that there is likely an electrical current flowing through it. Option (B) is incorrect because if the wire is cool to the touch, it suggests that there is no electrical current running through it. Option (C) is not necessarily true as grounding is a separate safety measure and not automatic. Option (D) is also not necessarily true as being water-safe is another safety measure that is not automatic."
