Option (A) suggests that her parents' intentions may be the cause, but this is unlikely as it implies that her parents intentionally named her Bigfoot or encouraged others to use that nickname. Option (C) suggests that it is a learned behavior, but it is unlikely that Suzy's friends learned to call her Bigfoot on their own without any influence or reason. Option (D) suggests that it is a result of her past life, but this is not a plausible explanation as past lives do not play a role in determining a person's nickname.\n\nOption (B), her parents' genes, is the most likely explanation. It suggests that Suzy may have physical characteristics or traits that resemble those associated with Bigfoot, which she has inherited from her parents. These characteristics may have led her friends to give her the nickname."

Option (A) is incorrect because her parents' intentions would not directly influence her physical traits.
