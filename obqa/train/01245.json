California lies along the boundary of two major tectonic plates - the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. These plates are constantly moving, causing stress and pressure to build up along their boundaries. When this stress becomes too great, it is released in the form of an earthquake. Options (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect because they do not accurately explain the cause of earthquake activity in California. Erosion refers to the wearing away of land by natural processes such as water and wind, while volcanic activity and fire are unrelated to plate tectonics and earthquake activity."
