Lodestones are natural magnets that have the ability to attract certain types of metals, such as iron. This attraction is referred to as magnetic allure or magnetism. When a metal nail is in close proximity to a lodestone, the magnetic force exerted by the lodestone causes the nail to be sharply yanked or attracted towards it. Option (B) is incorrect because corrosion is a chemical process and not related to magnetic attraction. Option (C) is incorrect because irritation is not a property or characteristic of lodestones. Option (D) is unrelated and not applicable to the situation described."
