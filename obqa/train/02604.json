Fat-soluble vitamins are vitamins that can dissolve in fat and are stored in the body's fatty tissues. These vitamins include vitamins A, D, E, and K.\n\nOption (A), dog, is an animal and not a food item. Animals can contain fat-soluble vitamins if they have consumed food sources that contain these vitamins, but we cannot determine that from the given information.\n\nOption (B), yogurt, is a food item and is likely to contain fat-soluble vitamins. Yogurt is made from milk, which is known to contain fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin A and vitamin D.\n\nOption (C), cat, is an animal and not a food item. Like with the dog, we cannot determine if a cat contains fat-soluble vitamins without knowing its diet.\n\nOption (D), water, is a non-caloric, non-fat substance and does not contain fat-soluble vitamins. Water does not dissolve fat-soluble vitamins, so it is unlikely to contain them.\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer is (B) yogurt, as it is a food item that is likely to contain fat-soluble vitamins."
