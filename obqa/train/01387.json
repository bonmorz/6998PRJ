Dogs reproduce through sexual reproduction, while earthworms reproduce through a process called hermaphroditism, where each individual has both male and female reproductive organs and can produce offspring on its own. Bears and wolves also reproduce through sexual reproduction, while cats reproduce through sexual reproduction but with different reproductive behaviors compared to dogs.
