On June 1st, it is the first day of winter in the southern hemisphere because the southern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun during this time. Option (A) is incorrect because the sun is not a season, but rather the source of energy for the Earth. Option (B) is incorrect because the Kepler belt refers to a region of space, not a season. Option (D) is incorrect because in the northern hemisphere, June 1st is the first day of summer, not winter."

This is because Earth experiences seasons due to its axial tilt. When it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer in the southern hemisphere, and vice versa. So, on June 1st, which is during the month of June, it is winter in the southern hemisphere. This makes option (C) the correct answer.
