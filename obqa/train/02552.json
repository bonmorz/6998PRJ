A fossil is the preserved remains or traces of a once-living organism. Option (A), a dino track, is a good example of a fossil because it is a trace left behind by a dinosaur. Option (B), an animal eye, is not a typical example of a fossil because soft tissues like eyes do not usually fossilize well. Option (C), a human heart, is also not a typical example of a fossil because fossils are usually much older than humans. Option (D), an abandoned nest, could potentially be a fossil if it were preserved over a long period of time and turned into rock, but it is not a typical example. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) dino track."
