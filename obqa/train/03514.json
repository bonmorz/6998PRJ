Komodo dragons are native to the islands of Indonesia, where they live in hot and dry environments. They are ectothermic, which means they rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. \n\nOption (A) states that the highest body temperature would occur if the komodo dragon was immersed in lava. This is incorrect because lava is molten rock with extremely high temperatures, and it would be fatal for the komodo dragon. \n\nOption (B) suggests that the highest body temperature would occur if the komodo dragon was immersed in apple juice. This is incorrect because apple juice is not a natural habitat or heat source for komodo dragons. \n\nOption (C) states that the highest body temperature would occur if the komodo dragon was immersed in liquid nitrogen. This is incorrect because liquid nitrogen is extremely cold and would cause the komodo dragon's body temperature to drop significantly. \n\nOption (D) suggests that the highest body temperature would occur if the komodo dragon was immersed in water. This is the correct answer because water can retain heat and conduct it to the body of the komodo dragon, allowing them to increase their body temperature. This is commonly observed in komodo dragons, as they often bask in the sun and soak in water to regulate their body temperature."
