Chlorophyll is a pigment found in the chloroplasts of plant cells and is responsible for capturing light energy from the sun through a process called photosynthesis. This captured energy is then converted into chemical energy that the plant can use to carry out its functions. Option (A) is incorrect because chlorophyll is not involved in waste elimination. Option (C) is incorrect because plants do not have the ability to regulate their temperature through chlorophyll. Option (D) is incorrect because chlorophyll is not involved in absorbing food from the soil."
