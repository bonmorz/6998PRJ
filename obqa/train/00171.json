Option (A) is correct because reproduction is typically a necessary stage in the life cycle for births to occur. Without reproduction, new individuals cannot be produced and added to the population. Option (B) is incorrect because death is not necessarily the last stage in the life cycle - there can be multiple stages after reproduction before death occurs. Option (C) is incorrect because it generalizes reproduction and does not specifically address it as a stage in the life cycle. Option (D) is incorrect because while it is possible for life to end during reproduction, it does not necessarily demonstrate that reproduction is a stage in the life cycle process."
