The correct answer is (B), weighted dips.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because breathing, while essential for overall health, does not directly increase the body's strength.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because while sleeping is important for muscle recovery and overall health, it does not directly increase strength.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because while nutrition is important for overall health and muscle growth, simply eating without specific exercise or resistance training will not directly increase strength.\n\nWeighted dips, on the other hand, involve adding additional weight to the body during a dip exercise, which increases the demand on the muscles and stimulates muscle growth. This, in turn, leads to increased strength. Therefore, with proper nutrition and regular weighted dips, the body's strength can be increased."
