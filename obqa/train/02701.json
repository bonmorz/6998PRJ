Among the given options, a shrew (option C) is most likely to have an electrical conductor that sends sensations through its organism because shrews have a well-developed nervous system that allows them to perceive and respond to stimuli in their environment. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because rocks are not living organisms and lack a nervous system. Option (B) is incorrect because ice is a non-living substance and cannot transmit electrical sensations. Option (D) is incorrect because trees, although living organisms, do not have a nervous system and do not transmit electrical sensations."

While it can transmit cold sensations if touched, it does not rely on electrical conduction to do so. \n\nOption (D), a tree, is a living organism with a complex internal structure, including the vascular system, but it does not have an electrical conductor that directly sends sensations through the organism."
