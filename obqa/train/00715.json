Mechanical weathering refers to the physical breakdown and fragmentation of rocks without any chemical changes. Option (A), a rock used to make fires, is likely to experience more mechanical weathering because it is exposed to high temperatures, which can cause expansion and contraction of the rock, leading to cracks and fragmentation. Option (B), a rock traveling through space, may experience extreme conditions, but it is not clear how this would contribute to mechanical weathering. Option (C), a rock far below the ground, is less likely to be exposed to weathering agents and therefore experience less mechanical weathering. Option (D), a rock hit by the sun's rays, does not provide enough information to determine if it would result in mechanical weathering. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely choice for a rock that would experience more mechanical weathering."

Mechanical weathering refers to the physical breakdown of rocks into smaller pieces without changing their chemical composition.\n\nOption (A) - a rock used to make fires: This rock is likely to be more mechanically weathered because it is subjected to high heat and thermal expansion and contraction. When a rock is heated and then rapidly cooled, the repeated expansion and contraction can cause the rock to gradually break apart.\n\nOption (B) - a rock traveling through space: This option is unlikely to contribute to mechanical weathering as rocks in space generally do not experience the same physical weathering forces as rocks on Earth.\n\nOption (C) - a rock far below the ground: Rocks that are deep underground are typically more stable and protected from physical weathering processes such as frost wedging and thermal expansion. Therefore, this option is less likely to contribute to mechanical weathering compared to the others.\n\nOption (D) - a rock is hit by the sun's rays: This option is unrelated to mechanical weathering. While the sun's rays can contribute to weathering processes like thermal expansion and contraction, the direct impact of the sun's rays on a rock would not be a significant factor in mechanical weathering.\n\nBased on the explanations above, we can conclude that option (A) - a rock used to make fires is the most likely to experience mechanical weathering."
