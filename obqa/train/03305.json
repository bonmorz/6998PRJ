When a plane is approaching someone standing on the ground, the sound of the plane's engines will appear to increase in pitch or become more intense. However, the question specifically mentions the plane's blinking, which suggests that we are referring to the plane's lights. The Doppler effect does not directly apply to visual stimuli, so we must consider other factors.\n\nWhen a plane is approaching, the lights on the plane will appear more intense or brighter. This is because the lights are getting closer to the observer, and as a result, the amount of light reaching the observer's eyes increases. Option (A) is the correct answer. Option (B) is incorrect because the lights would not appear duller as the plane gets closer. Option (C) is incorrect because the distance between the observer and the plane is decreasing, not increasing. Option (D) is also incorrect because the lights would appear more bright, not dimmer, as the plane gets closer."
