Stormy weather, typically characterized by rain and thunder, often leads to an increase in moisture levels in rain gauges. This is because the rainfall accumulates in the gauges, measuring the amount of precipitation that occurs during the storm. Option (A) is incorrect because stormy weather typically makes it difficult to have picnics in the park due to the rain and potentially dangerous conditions. Option (C) is incorrect because stormy weather usually brings rain, which would make fields and roads wet, not dry. Option (D) is incorrect because stormy weather is characterized by dark clouds, rain, and thunder, and is the opposite of sunny and bright days."
