Option (A) is correct, as brass is an alloy made of copper and zinc. Option (B) is incorrect because steel is primarily made of iron and carbon, not multiple metals. Option (C) is incorrect because aluminum is a pure metal, not an alloy. Option (D) is incorrect because tin is also a pure metal, not an alloy."

An alloy is a homogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-metal. Among the given options, brass is the only example of an alloy as it is made by combining copper and zinc. Steel (option B) is not an alloy made of multiple metals, but rather mainly composed of iron with small amounts of carbon. Aluminum (option C) is a metal but it is not an alloy made of multiple metals. Tin (option D) is also a metal, but it is not an example of an alloy made of multiple metals. Therefore, the correct answer is option A, brass."
