Primary producers, such as plants and algae, are the first level of the food chain and they obtain their nutrients from the soil. They use these nutrients to grow and thrive, becoming a source of nutrients for the organisms that consume them. Therefore, option (B) is correct because primary producers depend on the nutrients present in the soil. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because soil does not emanate nutrients into the air. Nutrients are absorbed by plant roots from the soil, rather than being released into the atmosphere. \n\nOption (C) is incorrect because not all living things eat sand. While some organisms may ingest small amounts of sand or soil particles, it is not a significant source of nutrients in the food chain. \n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the water we drink is not exclusively from the soil. Water sources can include rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water, in addition to groundwater which can be influenced by the soil."
