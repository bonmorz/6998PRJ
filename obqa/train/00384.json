In this scenario, if there is a thermal insulator between the stove and the pan, it would prevent the direct transfer of heat from the stove to the pan. As a result, the pan would get hot slower compared to if there was no thermal insulation. Option (B) is incorrect because the insulator is specifically designed to slow down the transfer of heat. Option (C) is also incorrect because if the insulator is effectively slowing down heat transfer, the pan would not heat up at the same speed as without the insulation. Option (D) is incorrect because the purpose of the insulation is to slow down heat transfer, thus preventing the pan from getting hotter faster."
