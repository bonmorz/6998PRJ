Cats have retractable claws that allow them to grip onto surfaces. A carpeted pole would provide the most traction and grip for a cat to climb up because the fibers of the carpet would interlock with their claws, giving them a secure grip. \n\nOptions (A), (C), and (D) are not ideal for climbing because they do not provide the same level of grip as a carpeted surface. A plastic pole would be slippery and cats may struggle to maintain a grip. An icy pole would be even more slippery and dangerous for a cat. A metal pole would also be slippery and cats may find it difficult to get a secure grip."
