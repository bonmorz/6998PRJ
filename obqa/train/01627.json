The source of air is nature, as it is primarily composed of gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and others that are naturally occurring in the environment. Option (A) is incorrect because while humans and other organisms inhale air, they are not the source of air itself. Option (B) is incorrect because although space contains a vacuum, it does not produce the gases that make up air. Option (C) is incorrect because chemistry is the study of substances and their properties, but it does not produce air."
