Traits such as hairstyle, hand size, and nail polish are not controlled by genes and are influenced by factors such as personal choice, grooming, or external factors. However, hand size is determined by genes and can be passed from parents to offspring. Option (A) is incorrect because hairstyle can be changed and is not determined by genes. Option (C) is incorrect because nail polish is a cosmetic choice and not a genetic trait. Option (D) is incorrect because vocabulary is learned and acquired through language exposure and is not determined by genes."

Option (A) hairstyle is influenced by genetics to some extent, but it is also heavily influenced by environmental factors and personal choice. Option (C) nail polish is not genetically determined. Option (D) vocabulary is influenced by genetics to a small extent, but it is primarily influenced by environmental factors and personal experiences."
