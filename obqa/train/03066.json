When it comes to flooding, a location of lower elevation is more affected by the flood compared to a higher location. This is because water naturally flows downward, so areas of lower elevation are more prone to being flooded. Option (B) is incorrect because a lower location is not more resistant to flooding. Option (C) is incorrect because a lower area is more likely to be wetter due to the accumulation of water during a flood. Option (D) is incorrect because it is possible for a location of any elevation to experience flooding, but lower elevation areas are at a higher risk."
