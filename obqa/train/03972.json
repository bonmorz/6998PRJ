Innate behaviors are those that an organism is born with and do not require any prior experience or learning. Learned behaviors, on the other hand, are behaviors that are acquired through experience or observation.\n\nOption (A) catching a frisbee is an example of a learned behavior. This is because catching a frisbee requires practice and coordination. Most people are not born with the ability to catch a frisbee, but they can learn how to do so with practice and experience.\n\nOption (B) cows eating grass is an example of an innate behavior. Cows are born with the instinct to eat grass as it is their natural diet. They do not need to learn or be taught how to eat grass.\n\nOption (C) having blue eyes is not an example of a learned behavior. Eye color is determined by genetics and is not a behavior that can be learned or acquired through experience.\n\nOption (D) birds growing wings is not an example of a learned behavior. Growing wings is a natural biological process that happens as part of a bird's development. It is not something that they learn or acquire through experience."
