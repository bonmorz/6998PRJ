Elephants typically live in areas with higher rainfall, such as plains or forests, where they will receive a higher amount of precipitation. Diamondback snakes, on the other hand, are found in arid desert regions with much lower rainfall. Therefore, they will receive different amounts of precipitation.

These areas may have rainfall during certain seasons and might also experience thunderstorms and occasional showers. So, an elephant on the plains is likely to receive some amount of precipitation.\n\nOn the other hand, a diamondback refers to the diamondback rattlesnake, which is commonly found in desert habitats. Deserts are known for their arid conditions and low amounts of precipitation. The desert environment experiences very little rainfall, often less than 10 inches per year. Therefore, the diamondback in the desert is likely to receive significantly less precipitation compared to an elephant on the plains.\n\nSince the habitats of an elephant on the plains and a diamondback in the desert have different levels of precipitation, we can conclude that they receive different amounts of precipitation. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) different amounts of precipitation."
