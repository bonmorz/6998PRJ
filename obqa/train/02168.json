Option (A) is the correct answer because honking is a sound that can travel through the air. Option (B) is incorrect because listening is a sensory experience and not a sound itself. Option (C) is unrelated because thinking is a cognitive process and not a sound. Option (D) is unrelated because sweating is a bodily function and not a sound."

Option (B) is incorrect because listening is the act of perceiving sound, not the sound itself. Option (C) is incorrect because thinking is a mental process, not a form of sound transmission. Option (D) is unrelated to sound and is a bodily function associated with perspiration."
