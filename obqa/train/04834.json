Mammals reproduce by sexual reproduction, where male and female mammals come together to produce offspring. This involves the fertilization of eggs by sperm and the development of embryos. Option (A) is incorrect because stealing children is not a natural method of reproduction for mammals. Option (B) is a valid method that some mammals use to expand their family, but it is not the only way. Option (C) is incorrect because mammals do not lay eggs, that is a characteristic of birds and reptiles. Therefore, option (D) is correct as it accurately describes the natural process of reproduction for mammals."
