Option (A), ice, does not have a taste as it is simply frozen water. Option (C), water, typically has a neutral taste unless it contains impurities. Option (D), air, also does not have a taste. \nOption (B), tropical twist, is the most likely answer because it implies a flavor that is distinct and different from the other options. When we taste something, it is usually because the substance has specific molecules that interact with our taste buds and send signals to our brain, allowing us to perceive different flavors."
