One possible advantage is that the bright colors can help the bird attract a mate and therefore find the mother of its future children. This is known as sexual selection, where certain traits, such as bright colors, play a role in mate choice. Option (B) is incorrect because attracting a plane to rescue them is not a natural advantage for the bird. Option (C) is possible but less likely because bright colors do not guarantee finding a good source of food. Option (D) is unrelated and not a natural advantage of bright multi-colored feathers."
