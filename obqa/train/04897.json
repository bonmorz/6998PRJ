Option (D), a long period without rainfall, can have several detrimental effects on a species. Lack of rainfall can lead to drought, which results in a scarcity of water sources for the species to drink and bathe in.

Additionally, prolonged drought can also result in the drying out of habitats, making it difficult for the species to find adequate shelter and resources.\n\nOptions (A), (B), and (C) are actually factors that can contribute to a species' survival rather than demise. An abundance of vegetation (option A) can provide food sources and support a healthy ecosystem. A good supply of prey (option B) ensures that the species has enough food to eat and survive. Adequate shelter and companionship (option C) are also important for the species' survival, as they provide protection from predators and help maintain social bonds within the population."
