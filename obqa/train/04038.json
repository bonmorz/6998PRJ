Producers are organisms that can use sunlight or inorganic substances to produce energy-rich organic compounds through the process of photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Option (D) is the correct answer because strawberries are a type of plant that can undergo photosynthesis to produce their own energy. Options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because they do not involve organisms that can produce their own energy. Cloudy mornings are a weather condition, vinyl is a type of material, and \"team Alicia\" likely refers to a group of people, none of which are producers in an ecological sense."
