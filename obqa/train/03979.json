When a thing is introduced to thermal activity, it will likely evaporate if it is able to drip. Evaporation occurs when a substance changes from a liquid state to a gas state due to the heat energy provided by thermal activity. Option (A) is incorrect because chilling refers to a decrease in temperature, not a change of state. Option (C) and (D) are incorrect because icing over and freezing both refer to the formation of ice, which occurs when a substance changes from a liquid to a solid state, not a gas state."
