Conservation generally refers to the practice of preserving and protecting valuable resources. In this case, the question suggests that avoiding something is an example of conservation. \n\nOption (A) is the correct answer because avoiding oil, particularly non-renewable fossil fuels, is a way to conserve natural resources. Oil is a finite resource, and by avoiding its use or reducing our reliance on it, we can help conserve it for future generations. \n\nOption (B) is incorrect because sunlight is a natural resource and avoiding it is not typically considered a conservation measure. In fact, sunlight is crucial for various ecological processes and is an important source of renewable energy. \n\nOption (C) is also incorrect because fats, like oil, are not typically associated with conservation efforts. While reducing the consumption of certain types of fats may be beneficial for health reasons, it is not directly related to conservation. \n\nOption (D) is unrelated to conservation as well. Tea is not typically associated with conservation efforts unless there are specific environmental concerns related to its production or consumption."
