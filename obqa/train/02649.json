Option (A), a daffodil with curled leaves, would have a reduced ability to absorb sunlight because the curled leaves would limit the amount of surface area exposed to sunlight. Option (B), a small plant with tiny leaves, would also have a reduced ability to absorb sunlight due to the limited surface area.
