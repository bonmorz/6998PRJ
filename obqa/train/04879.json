Earthquakes can shake and disrupt bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and oceans, which can directly affect fish and other aquatic life. Option (B) is incorrect because birds have the ability to fly and can easily avoid being shaken by an earthquake. Option (C) is incorrect because clouds are composed of water vapor and are not solid objects that can be shaken. Option (D) is incorrect because smoke is composed of particles in the air and is not affected by ground shaking."

While fish are not typically affected by earthquakes directly, the shaking of the ground can cause water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and oceans to shake as well.

Flying birds may be startled or disrupted by the sound and vibrations of an earthquake, but they are not physically affected by the shaking. Clouds and smoke are not solid objects and do not experience the same shaking as the Earth's surface."

Earthquakes can cause vibrations and shaking in the Earth's crust, which can be felt and observed at the surface.

Birds have the ability to sense vibrations and can often detect seismic activity before it occurs, so they may fly away or behave differently, but the shaking itself does not affect them. Similarly, clouds and smoke are not directly impacted by earthquakes as they are not physically connected to the Earth's surface."
