When there are clear skies, the sun's rays can directly heat up bodies of water, leading to increased evaporation. Evaporation is the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas, causing the amount of water to decrease. Option (B) is incorrect because water is actually present in the form of water vapor in the clouds.

Option (A) states \"under clear skies,\" which suggests that there is no precipitation or water input. Without any rain or water source, the amount of water would naturally decrease over time due to evaporation and other processes. \n\nOption (B) states \"in the clouds,\" but clouds are actually formed by water vapor condensing. So while water is present in the clouds, it is actually in the form of tiny droplets or ice particles suspended in the air. The cloud itself does not cause a decrease in water.\n\nOption (C) states \"during a storm,\" which indicates that there would be rainfall or other forms of precipitation. During a storm, the amount of water would not decrease, but rather increase due to the addition of precipitation.\n\nOption (D) states \"indoors,\" which does not provide enough context to determine if the amount of water would decrease or not. It depends on various factors, such as whether there is a leak or if water is being used.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A) under clear skies, as it implies a lack of water input and thus a decrease in the amount of water."
