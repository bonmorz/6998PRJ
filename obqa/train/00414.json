Option (A) is incorrect because flushing the toilet twice is wasteful and uses unnecessary water resources. Option (C) is also incorrect because driving shorter trips more often actually leads to more fuel consumption and air pollution compared to consolidating multiple errands into one trip. Option (D) is incorrect because using fancy, more expensive paper does not directly contribute to environmental protection.\n\nOption (B), using water flow limiter, is the correct answer because it helps conserve water. Water flow limiters restrict the flow of water from faucets and showers, reducing overall water usage. This conserves water resources and helps protect the environment by reducing strain on water sources."

Option (A), flushing the toilet twice, is wasteful and uses more water, which is not environmentally friendly. Option (C), driving shorter trips more often, may reduce fuel consumption per trip but overall increases the number of trips, resulting in a higher carbon footprint. Option (D), using fancy, more expensive paper, does not directly contribute to environmental protection, as it may involve the use of more resources and energy in its production. \n\nOption (B), using a water flow limiter, aligns with environmental protection. A water flow limiter reduces the amount of water used when faucets or showers are being used, conserving water and reducing water waste. This helps to conserve water resources and reduce overall water consumption, which is an important aspect of protecting the environment."
