Option (C) is the correct answer because ripping paper involves applying a force that tears the fibers of the paper, causing it to change shape. Option (A) is incorrect because spinning liquid mercury does not change the shape of an object, it only changes the shape of the mercury itself. Option (B) is incorrect because blowing on gases may cause them to move, but it does not change the shape of an object. Option (D) is incorrect because water cannot be cut to change the shape of an object, it can only flow around or fill the space of an object."
