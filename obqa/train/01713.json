Vaccines contain weakened or inactivated forms of pathogens, which stimulate the immune system to develop immunity without causing the full-blown disease. Option (A) is incorrect because strep throat is caused by bacteria, not viruses, and is typically treated with antibiotics. Option (B) is incorrect because the common cold is caused by various viruses and there is no vaccine for it. Option (D) is incorrect because diarrhea can be caused by many factors, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites, and there is no specific weakened agent introduced to prevent diarrhea."

Option (A), strep, is incorrect because there is currently no vaccine for streptococcus bacteria. Option (B), the common cold, is incorrect because there are many different viruses that cause the common cold, and there is currently no universally effective vaccine.
