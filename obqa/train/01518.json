Option (A) is unrelated to creating an ecosystem and is not a viable solution. Option (B) is also unrelated and does not contribute to creating a wildlife habitat. Option (D) may offer some benefits to the plants themselves, but it does not directly address creating a wildlife ecosystem. Option (C), planting a blue spruce, can provide several benefits for local wildlife. Blue spruces are evergreen trees that provide habitat for birds, squirrels, and other small animals. These trees offer nesting sites, protection from predators, and a potential food source in the form of their seeds. Additionally, the presence of trees can attract insects, which can be a valuable food source for birds and other animals. Overall, planting a blue spruce can have the most positive impact on creating a thriving ecosystem for local wildlife."
