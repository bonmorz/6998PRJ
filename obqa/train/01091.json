When it gets dark the earliest in California, it means that the sun has set and it is nighttime. The Earth rotates from west to east, so as California is on the western side of the United States, it is one of the first places to experience sunset. Option (A) is incorrect because the time California is closest to the sun is during daylight hours, not when it gets dark. Option (C) is also incorrect because Europe is several time zones ahead of California, so when it gets dark in California, it is already later in the night in Europe. Option (D) is incorrect because Mexico is also in the same time zone as California, so the timing of sunset would be similar. Option (B) is the correct answer because Australia is located on the opposite side of the Earth from California, so when it is nighttime in California, it is daytime in Australia and therefore closest to the sun."

When it gets dark the earliest in California, it means that the sun has already set there. This occurs because California is located in the western part of the United States, closer to the International Date Line. As the Earth rotates from west to east, areas in the east experience sunset before areas in the west. Australia is located in the eastern hemisphere, so it is closer in terms of longitude to California compared to Europe and Mexico. Therefore, when it gets dark the earliest in California, it is the time Australia is closest to the sun. Option (A) is incorrect because being closest to the sun does not affect when it gets dark. Options (C) and (D) are incorrect because they are not geographically relevant to California's location."

Option (D) is also incorrect because Mexico is in a different time zone and its proximity to the sun does not affect when it gets dark in California. \n\nThe correct answer must consider a location where it is already dark when it is still daytime in California.
