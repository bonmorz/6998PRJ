Option (B) is correct because over a long period of time, forests can become lakes due to processes such as sedimentation, erosion, and the filling of depressions. Option (A) is incorrect because cats eating mice is a predator-prey relationship that does not necessarily indicate a change on our planet. Option (C) is incorrect because clouds raining is a natural weather phenomenon and does not necessarily indicate a change on our planet. Option (D) is incorrect because deer running is a natural behavior of deer and does not necessarily indicate a change on our planet."

Option (B) is the correct answer because it describes a change where forests, which are land-based, transform into lakes, which are bodies of water.

Option (A) describes a predator-prey interaction but does not necessarily refer to a change on the planet.
