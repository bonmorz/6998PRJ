Blubber is a thick layer of fat that is present under the skin of bears and other marine mammals. It serves as an insulating layer, helping the bear to stay warm in cold environments. Therefore, option (A) is correct as it states that the bear's blubber enables him to keep his body cozy. Option (B) is incorrect because blubber does not affect a bear's ability to eat more. Option (C) is incorrect because blubber is actually beneficial to a bear's health. Option (D) is incorrect because blubber does not make it more difficult for the bear to function, rather it helps the bear to function in cold environments by providing insulation."
