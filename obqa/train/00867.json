Objects that are shiny have a smooth and reflective surface. \n\nOption (A) states \"dog tag.\" Dog tags are typically made of metal and have a shiny finish, so they can reflect light. This option is correct.\n\nOption (B) states \"ring.\" Rings are often made of metal and can have a shiny finish, so they can reflect light. This option is also correct.\n\nOption (C) states \"outlet.\" Outlets are typically made of plastic or metal, but they do not have a shiny surface. Instead, they have a matte or textured finish that absorbs light rather than reflecting it. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption (D) states \"confetti.\" Confetti is usually made of colored paper or lightweight materials that have a shiny coating. This shiny coating allows the confetti to reflect light, so this option is correct.\n\nIn conclusion, option (C) is the correct answer because outlets do not have the shiny, reflective surface necessary for reflecting light."
