When we see grey clouds in the sky, it often indicates that there is water vapor in the atmosphere, which can condense and fall as rain or other forms of precipitation. Option (A) is incorrect because grey clouds are not indicative of hot weather. Option (B) is incorrect because while electrical currents can develop within clouds, it is not the primary source or purpose of grey clouds.
