This is because floodwaters can make it difficult or impossible to access areas on the ground, and helicopters or other aircraft may be needed to rescue individuals stranded by the floods. Option (A) is incorrect because evictions do not typically require air rescues. Option (C) is possible in some cases, but it depends on the size and severity of the fire.

The answer is (B) flooding because during a flood, there may be large areas of water where traditional rescue methods like boats or vehicles may not be able to reach. In these situations, rescues conducted via air, such as helicopter rescue operations, are often the most effective means of saving individuals in danger. Option (A) eviction is unrelated to emergency situations. Option (C) fire may sometimes require air rescues, but it is less common than water-based emergencies like flooding. Option (D) bomb is unrelated to emergency rescues and may require more specialized responses from bomb disposal units."

Bomb incidents may require evacuation, but the method of rescue would depend on the specific circumstances and cannot be determined solely based on the given information."

In the case of an eviction (option A), there is no immediate danger to life or physical injury, so air rescues are unlikely. In a fire (option C) or bomb situation (option D), immediate evacuation is necessary, but it is more common for people to be evacuated by ground or safely guided out by emergency responders. \n\nOption B, flooding, is the most likely situation where air rescues would be conducted. During floods, especially if the water levels rise rapidly or there is swift water current, it can be extremely dangerous to rescue people using ground vehicles. In such cases, helicopters are often used to lift people out of flooded zones or to drop off necessary supplies and personnel. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer."
