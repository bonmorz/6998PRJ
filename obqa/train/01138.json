It requires light, carbon dioxide, and water. In December, the days are shorter and colder in many parts of the world.

Additionally, in colder temperatures, plant metabolism slows down, reducing the efficiency of photosynthesis. Option (C) is the correct answer because it corresponds to a time of year when photosynthesis would be less active. Options (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect because they correspond to times of the year when photosynthesis would typically be more active due to longer daylight hours and warmer temperatures."
