Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy, and this energy is then transferred through the food chain to animals that rely on plants for sustenance or food.

Option (C) is unrelated to the topic of photosynthesis and animal sustenance. Option (D) is the correct answer because it directly relates to the reliance of animals on plants for their survival and nutrition."
