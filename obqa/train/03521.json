In this case, moles would be the safest from predators in their natural underground habitat. Moles are adapted for living underground with specialized digging claws, sensitive snouts, and a lack of external ears and eyes. This allows them to navigate and forage underground, making it difficult for predators to reach them. Option (A) is incorrect because eagles are birds of prey and are adapted for catching their prey in the air or on the ground. Option (B) is incorrect because lizards are not specifically adapted for living underground and may have predators that can access their underground habitat. Option (D) is incorrect because sardines are not adapted for living underground and are typically found in open water environments where they can be preyed upon by larger fish and marine mammals."

Moles are burrowing animals and their underground tunnels provide them with protection from predators such as eagles and lizards. Eagles are birds of prey that primarily hunt from the air and would not be able to access the underground habitat of moles. Lizards are terrestrial animals that may be able to enter burrows, but they are less adapted to the underground environment compared to moles. Sardines are small fish and do not have a natural underground habitat, so they would not be safe from predators in this context."

Among the given options, moles would be safest from predators in their natural underground habitat. Moles are adapted to live underground, where they dig extensive burrow systems for shelter and protection. Their small size, strong claws, and specialized sensory organs allow them to navigate and survive in this habitat. Eagles are birds of prey and primarily live in open habitats, where they can spot their prey from above. Lizards are typically found in a variety of habitats, including deserts, forests, and grasslands, but they are not specialized for an underground lifestyle. Sardines are typically found in the open ocean and are preyed upon by larger fish and marine mammals."

Option (D) sardines are small fish that live in the ocean and have no natural underground habitat.\n\nOption (C) moles, on the other hand, are specifically adapted for living underground. They have powerful front limbs and specialized digging claws that allow them to create extensive tunnel systems. Moles have also evolved to have poor eyesight since they rely primarily on their sense of touch and smell in the darkness of the underground. Therefore, moles would be the safest from predators in their natural underground habitat due to their adaptations and specialized behaviors."

While some lizards are known to live in burrows or underground tunnels, not all lizards have this behavior. Additionally, there are predators such as snakes that can still hunt lizards underground.\n\nOption (D) mentions sardines, which are fish. Fish naturally live in water, so an underground habitat would not provide safety from predators.\n\nOption (C) states that moles would be safest from predators in their natural underground habitat. Moles are small mammals that are adapted to living underground. They create intricate tunnel systems and are specialized for burrowing. Their underground habitat provides them with protection from many predators, as they are not easily accessible or visible. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer."
