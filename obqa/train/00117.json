When a string is strummed, it creates a vibration that propagates through the medium, creating a pressure wave. This is the type of wave that is commonly associated with sound waves. Option (A) is incorrect because tidal waves are caused by gravitational forces and the movements of the Earth, not by strumming a string. Option (C) is incorrect because light waves are electromagnetic waves, not mechanical waves like the ones produced by strumming a string. Option (D) is incorrect because there is no such thing as a \"dark\" wave."
