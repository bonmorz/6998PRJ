One common change that can cause plants to adapt is a lack of light. If the environment becomes darker and receives less sunlight, plants may adapt by growing taller or developing larger leaves to maximize their exposure to light. Option (A) is incorrect because new laws do not directly impact a plant's ability to survive. Option (C) is unrelated to adaptation in plants. Option (D) is also unrelated to adaptation and is more likely to have negative effects on plant growth."
