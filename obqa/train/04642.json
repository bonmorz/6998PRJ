Option (D), a forest, would also not cause an exodus as it is a natural habitat for many animals.\n\nOption (C) a car dealership may cause an animal exodus from the region. This is because car dealerships often require a large amount of concrete and asphalt for parking lots and buildings, which can destroy natural habitats and disrupt the ecosystem.
