While all living organisms need water to survive and stay hydrated, only a bamboo stalk can hydrate without moving. Bamboo stalks have the ability to absorb water from the ground through their root system, allowing them to stay hydrated without needing to move. Options (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect because pandas, raccoons, and dogs need to consume water through drinking or other means to stay hydrated."

Option (A) is a panda, which is a mammal and therefore requires water to survive, so it would need to move to a water source to hydrate. Option (C) is a raccoon, which is also a mammal and would need to move to a water source to hydrate. Option (D) is a dog, another mammal that would need to move to hydrate. \n\nOption (B) is a bamboo stalk, which is a type of plant. Plants are able to hydrate themselves through a process called transpiration. They are able to draw water from the ground through their roots and transport it up to the leaves where it can be used for various processes. So, a bamboo stalk is the most likely option to hydrate without moving."
