When water freezes inside depressions in building materials, it expands as it turns into ice. This expansion can cause the building materials to crack, break, or become damaged over time. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) expand. Option (A) is incorrect because the materials will not decompose due to frozen water, only potentially become damaged. Option (B) is also incorrect because the building materials are not likely to collapse from frozen water alone. Option (C) is incorrect because the frozen water expansion will actually cause the materials to expand, not contract."
