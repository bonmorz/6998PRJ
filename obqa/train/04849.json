Option (A) is incorrect because aluminum cans are made from aluminum, not recycled paper. Option (B) is incorrect because plastic bottles are made from plastic, not recycled paper. Option (D) is incorrect because glass bottles are made from glass, not recycled paper.\n\nCellulose nanofibers are a material that can be produced from recycled paper. Cellulose, the main component of plant cell walls, can be extracted from recycled paper and processed into nanofibers. These nanofibers have various applications, including in the production of textiles, films, and composites.
