In this scenario, the field is experiencing above-average rainfall and food is abundant. These favorable conditions would likely lead to an increase in resources available for the rabbits living in the field. When resources are plentiful, animals often have the ability to reproduce more successfully. Thus, the rabbits living in the field would be expected to produce larger litters as a result of the increased food availability. Option (B) is incorrect because in this scenario, the rabbits do not need to find new land since the current field is providing ample resources. Option (C) is incorrect because the abundance of food would actually increase the likelihood of survival, leading to longer lifespans. Option (D) is incorrect because with an increase in available food, the rabbits would likely consume more rather than less."
