Option (A) mentions cookies, which might be harmful if consumed in excess or if the person has certain dietary restrictions, but it is less likely to cause immediate harm compared to the other options. Option (B) mentions drinking, which could refer to alcoholic beverages or any liquid consumption. While excessive alcohol consumption can be harmful, this option is quite broad and does not specify any particular substance or situation. Option (C) mentions eating, which is a normal and necessary activity for organisms to receive nutrients. However, if the food is contaminated or toxic, it could potentially harm the organism. Lastly, option (D) mentions a car explosion, which is the likeliest option to cause immediate and severe harm to an organism. Car explosions involve high levels of force and can lead to severe injuries or even death. Therefore, option (D) is the likeliest to harm an organism."

Option (B) drinking alone is generally not harmful unless it involves consuming toxic substances or excessive amounts of alcohol. Option (C) eating is a necessary activity for organisms to survive, so it would not generally be harmful unless the food consumed is poisonous or contaminated.
