This is particularly true in the case of glaciers, where melted ice can carve out valleys and create landforms. Option (A) is incorrect because ice melting does not affect clouds. Option (B) is incorrect because ice melting does not directly erode plants. Option (D) is incorrect because while melted ice can contribute to the volume of rivers, it is not the primary cause of erosion in river systems. However, option (C) is correct because the flowing water from melted ice can erode granite rock formations over time."
