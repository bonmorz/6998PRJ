Elephant ear leaves, being large and broad, have a greater surface area exposed to sunlight compared to smaller objects like blades of grass, a bat, or a worm. This means that elephant ear leaves will receive more sunlight. Option (B) is incorrect because blades of grass are smaller and have less surface area.

Elephant ear leaves, being large and broad, have a larger surface area than blades of grass, a bat, or a worm. More surface area means a greater exposure to sunlight. Therefore, elephant ear leaves will receive more sunlight compared to the other options. Blades of grass are smaller and more delicate, so they will receive less sunlight. A bat is a mammal and is not directly reliant on sunlight for energy, as it is nocturnal and primarily feeds on insects. A worm, being subterranean, spends most of its time underground and therefore receives very little sunlight."

Elephant Ear Leaves are large, flat leaves that are positioned high up in the air, often with minimal or no obstruction from other objects. This positioning allows them to receive direct sunlight for a longer duration compared to other options. Blades of grass are closer to the ground and can be shaded by other objects, such as trees or buildings. A bat is an animal that primarily resides in dark areas, such as caves, and thus is not exposed to direct sunlight. A worm lives underground and is typically shielded from direct sunlight. Therefore, Elephant Ear Leaves are the option that will receive the most sunlight."

Elephant ear leaves are large and broad, which allows them to capture and receive more sunlight compared to smaller objects like blades of grass, a bat, or a worm.

Blades of grass are low to the ground and can be shaded by other plants or objects, while a bat and worm are typically found in shaded and hidden areas.

Therefore, option (B) is less likely to receive as much sunlight as option (A).\n\nOption (C) states \"A bat.\" Bats are nocturnal animals and are active during the night. They typically roost in dark places during the day, such as caves or tree hollows. Therefore, they are unlikely to receive significant amounts of sunlight.\n\nOption (D) states \"A worm.\" Worms live underground in soil or in dark, damp areas.
