Audible vibrations or sound waves travel best through mediums that allow for the easy transmission of vibrations. Nitrogen and oxygen, which are the main components of air, allow sound waves to travel freely. Option (A) is incorrect because brick is a dense material that does not easily transmit sound waves. Option (C) is partially correct as sound waves can also travel through the ground, but it is not the best answer as they would travel more efficiently through nitrogen and oxygen. Option (D) is incorrect because mountains are solid and dense, making it difficult for sound waves to travel through them."
