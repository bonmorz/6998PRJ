They contain a wire filament that is heated by an electric current, producing light and heat as a result. Option (B), fluorescent lamps, do not convert electricity into heat but instead use electricity to excite mercury vapor, which then emits ultraviolet light that is converted into visible light by a phosphor coating on the inside of the lamp. Option (C), LED lamps, also convert electricity into light, but they do not produce heat to the same extent as incandescent lamps. Option (D), candles, do not use electricity at all to produce light and heat; instead, they rely on a burning wick."
