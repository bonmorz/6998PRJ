Moths undergo a process called stage conversion, which refers to their transformation from one life stage to another. Moths typically undergo a complete metamorphosis, which includes stages such as egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa, and adult. Option (A) is incorrect because migration refers to the movement of animals from one location to another, which is not specific to moths. Option (C) is incorrect because amelioration refers to the act of improving or making something better, which does not apply to the life cycle of a moth. Option (D) is incorrect because surgery refers to a medical procedure, which is not applicable to moths."
