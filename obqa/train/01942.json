Metamorphosis is a biological process in which an animal undergoes a major change in its body structure and function. It often involves a transition from an immature form to an adult form. In this case, the question asks which form allows the animal to perform a specific function.\n\nOption (A), communication with others, is not typically a direct result of metamorphosis. While some animals may exhibit changes in communication behaviors as part of their development, communication is not a primary purpose of metamorphosis.\n\nOption (B), eating, is necessary for an animal's survival, but it is not the specific purpose of metamorphosis. Animals need to eat in both their immature and adult forms.\n\nOption (C), reproduction, is the correct answer. Metamorphosis often allows animals to reach sexual maturity. It involves changes in reproductive organs, behaviors, or abilities, enabling animals to reproduce successfully and continue their species.\n\nOption (D), hunting for food, is not directly related to metamorphosis. Hunting for food is a general behavior that animals engage in throughout their lives, regardless of their developmental stage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) reproduction because metamorphosis allows animals to reach sexual maturity and perform the necessary reproductive functions."

Typically, it occurs in insects such as butterflies and beetles. During metamorphosis, an animal goes through distinct stages, such as egg, larva, pupa, and adult. These stages have different structures and functions. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because metamorphosis is not primarily about communication.

However, the specific forms of feeding may differ between larval and adult stages. \n\nOption (D) is also not the main purpose of metamorphosis. Hunting for food is a behavior typically associated with adult stages of animals, but metamorphosis is primarily about transitioning from an immature form to a mature, reproductive form. \n\nOption (C) is the correct answer because one of the main purposes of metamorphosis is to enable reproductive capabilities in the adult stage.
