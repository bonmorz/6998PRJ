Amphibians, such as salamanders and frogs, undergo metamorphosis, which means they go through different stages of development. They start as a different-looking being, often in the form of eggs or larvae, and then transform into their adult form. Option (A) is true for some species of salamanders, as they have the ability to regrow their tails if they lose them. Option (B) is also true, as salamanders can lose their tails through predation or other events. Option (C) is partially true, as frogs can breathe air and water but they rely more on lungs as adults."

Amphibians, such as salamanders and frogs, undergo metamorphosis, which means they go through different stages of development with distinct appearances.

Option (A) is partially correct because some salamanders can regrow their tails, but not all amphibians have this ability. Option (B) is incorrect because salamanders do not \"lose\" their tails, they naturally regenerate them if they are broken or damaged.

Option (A) is partially correct because some salamanders can regrow their tails if they are injured or lost, but this is not the main change in structure that occurs during metamorphosis.
