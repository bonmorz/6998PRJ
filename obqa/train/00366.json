Option (B) is correct because food containing preservatives is designed to have a longer shelf life and resist spoilage. In this case, the food will remain fresher for a longer period of time, even when traveling long distances. Option (A) is incorrect because freshly cooked food will spoil more quickly compared to food with preservatives. Option (C) is incorrect because raw uncooked fish is highly perishable and will spoil quickly, especially when exposed to travel conditions. Option (D) is incorrect because uncooked beef also has a high risk of spoilage and is not suitable for long-distance travel without proper preservation methods."

Option (C) of raw uncooked fish meal may also spoil over time and become unsafe to eat. Option (D) of uncooked beef also poses risks of bacterial contamination if not stored properly.\n\nOption (B) of a student with food containing preservatives would have the freshest meal because preservatives are added to food to prolong its shelf life and delay spoilage. These preservatives help suppress the growth of bacteria, mold, and other microorganisms that cause food to spoil. Therefore, even over long distances, food containing preservatives would maintain its freshness compared to freshly cooked food, raw fish meal, or uncooked beef.\n\nIt's important to note that while option (B) may have the freshest meal, it may not necessarily be the healthiest option due to the potentially harmful effects of consuming food with preservatives."

Raw uncooked fish meal, option (C), is highly perishable and would spoil quickly without proper refrigeration. Uncooked beef, option (D), also poses a risk of spoiling without proper refrigeration.\n\nOption (B) - a student with food containing preservatives - is the correct answer. Preservatives are added to food products to prolong their shelf life and prevent spoilage. By choosing food containing preservatives, the student can ensure that their meal stays fresh for a longer period of time during travel. Preservatives inhibit the growth of bacteria, yeast, and mold, which are the main culprits of food spoilage. Therefore, option (B) would provide the freshest meal for a student traveling long distances with their lunch."

Option (C) with raw uncooked fish meal is also not ideal as raw fish is highly perishable and can become unsafe to consume if not stored and transported properly. Option (D) with uncooked beef also carries a risk of spoilage and potential foodborne illnesses.\n\nOption (B) with food containing preservatives is the most reasonable choice in this scenario. Preservatives are added to food to prolong its shelf life and prevent spoilage. This means that the student would have a longer window of time before the food becomes inedible.
