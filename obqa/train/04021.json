Option (B) is the correct answer because it refers to measuring the space between one's toes, which is a form of length or distance. Option (A) is incorrect because a ruler cannot measure smells, which are not physical quantities. Option (C) is incorrect because a ruler cannot measure the length of air, as air does not have a physical form that can be measured with a ruler. Option (D) is incorrect because a ruler cannot measure emotions or anger, which are abstract concepts."
