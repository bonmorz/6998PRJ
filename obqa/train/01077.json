The correct answer is (B) 24 hours. \n\nExplanation: The rotation period of a planet depends on its size, mass, and rotational velocity. For Earth, it takes approximately 24 hours for one complete rotation on its axis. This is known as a solar day and is the unit of time that we use to measure a day.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because 22 hours is less than a full rotation period for a planet. Option (C) is incorrect because \"twenty hours\" is not a specific value and not a commonly used unit of time. Option (D) is incorrect because \"twenty one hours\" is also not a generally recognized unit of time for a planet's rotation period."
