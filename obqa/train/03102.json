Bees, specifically, play an integral role in the survival of many types of flora because they are primary pollinators. Bees transfer pollen from the male parts of a flower to the female parts, allowing plants to reproduce and produce fruits and seeds. Options (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because cats, dogs, and mice do not play a significant role in the pollination process."

Bees, option (A), are known to play an integral role in pollination. Bees fly from flower to flower collecting pollen and in the process, inadvertently transfer pollen from the male part of a flower to the female part of another flower. This fertilizes the flowers and allows them to produce fruits and seeds, which are essential for reproduction and the survival of many types of flora. Options (B), (C), and (D) - cat, dog, and mouse, respectively - are not involved in the process of pollination and therefore do not play an integral role in the survival of plants."
