In order to play PONG, the classic video game, you would need to complete a circuit by connecting the game console or computer to a power source and then connecting the console to a display device such as a TV or monitor. Option (A) tic tac toe does not require a circuit, as it is a pen-and-paper game. Option (B) ping pong refers to the sport of table tennis and does not involve circuits. Option (C) hide and seek is a physical activity and does not involve circuits."

In this case, only option (D) PONG would require completing a circuit to play. PONG is a classic video game that was played on early arcade machines or home consoles. These machines had buttons or switches that needed to be pressed to complete a circuit and initiate the movement of the pong ball on the screen. Options (A), (B), and (C) are all traditional games that do not require completing an electrical circuit to play."

Completing a circuit typically refers to an electrical circuit, so we can assume that the question is asking which game requires electrical input to play. Option (D), PONG, is a classic video game that requires a connection to an electrical circuit to function. Option (A), tic tac toe, does not require any electrical input to play. Option (B), ping pong, is a physical sport that does not require electrical input. Option (C), hide and seek, is a traditional children's game that does not require any electrical input. Therefore, the answer is (D) PONG."
