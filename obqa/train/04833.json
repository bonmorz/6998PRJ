Successful reproduction refers to the process by which offspring are produced that are capable of surviving and reproducing themselves. Option (A), a clay tablet splitting into two identical halves, does not involve any living organisms and therefore does not constitute successful reproduction. Option (B), a bird chirping to its mate, is a form of communication and can be part of the reproductive behavior of birds, but it does not directly involve the production of offspring. Option (D), a smaller iceberg splitting from a larger one, does not involve the production of offspring or the continuation of a species.\n\nOption (C), a doe running beside her fawn, is a clear example of successful reproduction. The doe represents the parent, and the fawn is the offspring. The fact that they are running together suggests that the fawn has been successfully produced and is capable of keeping up with its parent, indicating that it has survived and is likely to grow up and reproduce itself.\n\nTherefore, option (C) is the correct answer as it represents a clear example of successful reproduction in the animal kingdom."
