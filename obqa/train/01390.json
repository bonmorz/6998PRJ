When a switch is turned on, it allows metal contacts to come into contact with each other, closing the circuit and allowing the current to flow. Option (A) is incorrect because electrons are not made to excite; rather, their movement is facilitated by closing the circuit. Option (C) is incorrect because the engine running is not directly related to the action of a switch. Option (D) is incorrect because when the circuit is opened completely, the flow of electricity is prevented and the switch is turned off."
