Option (A) is incorrect because horses do not hatch from eggs, they are mammals and give live birth. Option (B) is incorrect because birds lay eggs and do not give birth directly from the womb. Option (D) is incorrect because fish are aquatic animals and do not come onto land to give birth. Option (C) is the correct answer because frogs lay eggs, and the offspring develop and hatch from those eggs, before undergoing metamorphosis into adult frogs."
