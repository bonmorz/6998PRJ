Electrical energy is the energy produced by the movement of electrons through conductive materials. It can be harnessed and used to power various devices and appliances. \n\nOption (A), running a mile, does not involve the use of electrical energy. Running requires physical exertion and the use of muscles, not electricity. \n\nOption (B), swimming, also does not involve the use of electrical energy. Swimming is a physical activity that relies on the movement and coordination of the body in water. \n\nOption (D), rock climbing, similarly does not require electrical energy. It is a physical activity that involves climbing rocks or artificial walls using strength and agility. \n\nOption (C), baking a bagel, can be done using electrical energy. Baking typically involves using an electric oven or toaster, which requires electrical energy to generate heat and cook the food. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer."
