When a cloud begins to precipitate, it means that the water vapor in the cloud is condensing and falling to the ground in the form of rain, snow, or other forms of precipitation. Option (A) is incorrect because fluttering refers to a light, flapping movement and is not related to precipitation. Option (B) is anthropomorphizing a cloud and is not related to precipitation. Option (C) is incorrect because crowing refers to the sound a rooster makes, not the process of precipitation. Option (D) is the correct answer because when a cloud starts to precipitate, it is essentially \"leaking\" water onto the ground."
