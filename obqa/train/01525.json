As a person goes deeper into the ocean, the weight of the water above them increases, creating higher pressure. This is known as water pressure or hydrostatic pressure. So, when the person reaches a darker part of the ocean, there is actually more weight or pressure on them. Option (A) is incorrect because as one goes deeper into the ocean, less sunlight reaches that depth, resulting in less light and darker conditions. Option (C) is also incorrect because the amount of salt in the ocean does not change significantly with depth. Option (D) is unrelated and not related to the properties of the ocean."
