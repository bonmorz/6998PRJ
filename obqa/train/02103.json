Calves born in warm seasons have better chances to flourish compared to those born in cold seasons. This is because warm seasons provide optimal conditions for growth and survival, such as abundant food resources, favorable temperatures, and longer daylight hours. Option (A) is incorrect because a calf's ability to see is not directly influenced by the season of its birth. Option (B) is also incorrect because calves born in both warm and cold seasons are capable of standing shortly after birth. Option (C) is not well-defined and does not provide a clear comparison between calves born in different seasons."
