Bears typically live in cooler environments, such as forests and mountains, so they would not likely live in the hottest environment. Penguins are adapted to cold climates and are typically found in Antarctica, so they would also not likely live in the hottest environment. Moose are commonly found in northern forests and prefer cooler temperatures, so they would not likely live in the hottest environment either. Scorpions, on the other hand, are known for their ability to survive in hot and arid environments. They are adapted to withstand high temperatures and can be found in deserts around the world. Therefore, the most likely animal to live in the hottest environment is the scorpion."
