To calculate the percent chance, we use a Punnett square, which is a grid that shows the possible combinations of alleles from two parents. Each allele represents a version of a gene. In a Punnett square, the boxes represent the different possible genotypes of the offspring.\n\nTo calculate the percent chance, we need to know the genotypes of both parents. Each parent can contribute one or two alleles to the offspring, depending on whether the trait is dominant or recessive.\n\nTo determine the percent chance of a trait being passed down, we need to consider the different possible combinations of alleles in the offspring.

Each box in the Punnett square represents a different combination of alleles, and we can calculate the percent chance by counting the number of boxes that contain the desired trait and dividing it by the total number of boxes.\n\nIn a Punnett square, we need one row for each possible allele combination from one parent and one column for each possible allele combination from the other parent. In total, we need two rows and two columns, resulting in four boxes in the Punnett square.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) four boxes.
