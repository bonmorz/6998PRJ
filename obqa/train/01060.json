Option (A) refers to the process of hatching from an egg, which is known as oviparity. Some animals, like birds and reptiles, lay eggs with tough shells and the offspring hatch from these eggs. Option (B) refers to animals like turtles that lay their eggs in sand and the offspring dig their way out. Option (C) refers to certain animals, like birds, that lay eggs and then incubate them until they hatch. Option (D) refers to animals that build nests to protect their eggs before they hatch."

Option (A) is correct because some organisms, like birds or reptiles, are born by breaking out of a tough shell, like an egg.
