We can deduce the correct answer by considering the typical properties and characteristics of each item. \n\nOption (A) taffy is a type of candy that is known for its soft and chewy texture. It is made by heating sugar, butter, and other ingredients, which results in a soft and pliable candy. This makes it the most likely choice for a \"soft\" item. \n\nOption (B) steel is a strong and tough metal that is used in construction and manufacturing. It is known for its hardness and durability, so it is not considered soft. \n\nOption (C) diamond is the hardest naturally occurring substance on Earth. It is known for its extreme hardness and is used in various industrial applications. Diamonds are not soft. \n\nOption (D) hard pretzels are a type of baked snack that has a crunchy and crisp texture. They are not soft. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) taffy, as it is the most likely option that would be considered \"soft\" compared to the other choices."
