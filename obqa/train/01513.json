The correct answer is (A), the ticker, which is a colloquial term for the heart. The heart is largely comprised of muscle tissue and is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. Option (B), the spleen, is not primarily composed of muscle tissue but is involved in filtering blood. Option (C), the kidney, is not primarily composed of muscle tissue but is involved in filtering waste from the blood.
