Students in a class can be classified based on various criteria such as age, grade level, gender, or favorite animal.

Option (A) is incorrect because \"species\" refers to different types of organisms, not students in a class. Option (C) is incorrect because students in a class are all assumed to be from the same planet (Earth).
