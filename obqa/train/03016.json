A prism is a transparent object that refracts light, causing it to separate into different colors. Option (D) is the correct answer because jello is a gelatinous substance that can be molded into a prism shape and is transparent enough to refract light. Option (A) is incorrect because dried dung is not transparent and cannot refract light. Option (B) is incorrect because pine martens are animals and not a material that can be used to create a prism.
