Marble is formed when limestone undergoes metamorphism, which involves intense heat and pressure. Lava is molten rock that is expelled from a volcano during an eruption. When lava is still hot, it is in a molten state and has not yet solidified or cooled down. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. Option (B) is incorrect because marble is formed from the cooling and hardening of lava. Option (C) is also incorrect because the cooling down of lava is a necessary step in the formation of marble. Option (D) is a humorous choice and not related to the scientific process of marble formation."

Marble is formed from limestone that has undergone high heat and pressure over time. Lava, on the other hand, is molten rock that is ejected from a volcano during an eruption.

Option (B) is incorrect because hardening is the process that occurs after lava has cooled down.
