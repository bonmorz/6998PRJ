Some animals, such as birds, use rocks as a means of safeguarding themselves during bad weather. They may seek refuge in rocky areas or use rocks as cover to protect themselves from wind, rain, or predators. Option (A) is incorrect because animals do use rocks as a means of protection. Option (B) is unrelated to the topic and not relevant. Option (D) is a random answer that is not supported by any known animal behavior."
