A disperser is any agent that helps in the dispersal or spreading of seeds or offspring.

Option (A) is incorrect because playing alone does not involve spreading or dispersing anything. Option (B) is incorrect because running around with hands in the air does not involve dispersal. Option (D) is incorrect because taking all the Fruit Loops for oneself is hoarding, not dispersing."
