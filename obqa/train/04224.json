When there are more factories and cars releasing gas (pollutants) into the air, the air quality decreases, leading to increased levels of pollution and haze. As a result, it becomes harder to go stargazing because the pollutants in the air cause reduced visibility, obscuring the view of the stars. Options (A), (B), and (D) are unrelated to air pollution and not affected by the presence of gas in the air."
