When a soccer ball goes flying through the air, the reason is because some force, such as a person kicking the ball or the ball being propelled by another object, caused it to move. Option (A) is incorrect because not everything is aerial, and it does not explain why the soccer ball is flying. Option (C) is incorrect because balls are not birds and cannot fly on their own. Option (D) is incorrect because while \"soccer takes wing\" is a poetic phrase, it does not explain the reason for the ball flying through the air. Only option (B) correctly states that exerting force, either by the person kicking or another object, caused the ball to go flying."
