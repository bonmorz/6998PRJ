Bald eagles are known to prefer fish as their primary source of prey, but they are also known to prey on small mammals. Among the options given, the hare is the only small mammal. Option (B) is incorrect because dogs are not typically preyed upon by bald eagles. Option (C) is incorrect because hawks are birds of prey themselves and not typically preyed upon by bald eagles. Option (D) is incorrect because bears are much larger than what bald eagles typically prey on."

Bald eagles are known to prey on a variety of animals, including fish, waterfowl, and small mammals. One small mammal that is commonly targeted by bald eagles is the hare. \n\nOption (A), hare, is correct because bald eagles do commonly prey on hares due to their small size and vulnerability. \n\nOption (B), dog, is incorrect because bald eagles do not typically prey on dogs. Dogs are much larger and more difficult for a bald eagle to capture and overpower. \n\nOption (C), hawk, is incorrect because hawks are birds of prey themselves and would not be considered prey for a bald eagle. \n\nOption (D), bear, is incorrect because bears are much larger and more powerful than bald eagles and would not typically be targeted as prey."
