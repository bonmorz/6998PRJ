Trees play a crucial role in filtering pollutants from the air and releasing oxygen through photosynthesis. When too many trees are cut down in a given area, there is a decrease in the air's quality because there is less vegetation to filter out pollutants and produce oxygen. Option (B) is incorrect because cutting down trees would increase the levels of carbon dioxide in the air since trees absorb it during photosynthesis. Option (C) is irrelevant as helium amounts in the air are not directly affected by the cutting down of trees.
