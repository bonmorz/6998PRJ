The Asteroid Belt is located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter and is composed of numerous rocky objects called asteroids. Jupiter's larger mass and strong gravitational pull disrupt the gravitational forces within the Asteroid Belt, preventing the rocks from accumulating into a single planet. Option (A) is incorrect because the Inner Solar System refers to the area closest to the Sun, which is not directly influenced by Jupiter's mass and orbit. Option (B) is incorrect because the Oort Cloud is a region of icy bodies located far beyond the orbits of Neptune and Pluto, and is not directly influenced by Jupiter.
