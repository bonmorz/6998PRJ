Coral and algae have a symbiotic relationship, where algae live inside the coral polyps and provide them with vibrant colors through photosynthesis. Option (A) is incorrect because love is not relevant to the relationship between coral and algae. Option (B) is also incorrect because algae do not provide dating advice to coral.
