When a glacier goes past a dock and brushes up against large boulders, it can create gouges or scratches on the surface of the rocks. This is because glaciers are made up of ice and rocks, and as the glacier moves, it can pick up and carry rocks along with it, which then scrape against other rocks. Option (B) is incorrect because stains are not a typical result of glaciers brushing against rocks. Option (C) is incorrect because being frozen is the natural state of a glacier, not the effect it has on rocks. Option (D) is incorrect because being dirty is not a direct result of the interaction between a glacier and rocks."

When a glacier brushes up against large boulders, it can cause gouges or scratches on the surface of the boulders.

Option (B) is incorrect because stains are not typically a result of glaciers brushing against boulders. Option (C) is incorrect because the boulders themselves would not freeze, although they may become covered in ice if the glacier has some meltwater. Option (D) is incorrect because the boulders may become dirty from debris carried by the glacier, but the primary effect would be gouges rather than general dirtiness."
