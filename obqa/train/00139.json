Raccoons have the ability to see in the dark and have nimble hands that allow them to manipulate objects. Therefore, they are the most likely to find the light switch and turn on the lights in a dark room. Option (A) is incorrect because mice do not typically have the capability to turn on light switches. Option (B) is incorrect because although elephants have excellent memories and vision, they do not have the dexterity to manipulate a light switch. Option (D) is also incorrect because hamsters do not have the capabilities of finding and manipulating a light switch."
