One of the physiological processes that help regulate warmth in the body is thermoregulation, which involves the kidneys. The kidneys play a role in maintaining the body's internal temperature by regulating blood flow and adjusting urine production. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer. Options (A), (B), and (C) are unrelated and do not contribute to the regulation of warmth in living things."
