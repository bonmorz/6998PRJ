Therefore, their diet typically includes weeds, grasses, and other plant-based foods. Option (A) is incorrect because crickets are insects, not part of a typical rabbit diet. Option (B) is incorrect because mice are carnivorous animals and not part of a rabbit's diet. Option (C) is incorrect because fish are also not part of a rabbit's diet as they are not terrestrial animals."
