Glaciers are formed from the accumulation and compaction of snow over many years. As more snow layers on top, the weight compresses the snow below, causing it to transform into dense ice. This process is similar to how water vapor (steam) condenses and transforms into liquid water when it cools down. Option (A) is incorrect because pencils are made from graphite and wood, not ice. Option (C) is incorrect because gas that lights up signs typically refers to neon gas, which is not the same as the ice that forms glaciers. Option (D) is also incorrect because the gas used to fill up balloons is usually helium or carbon dioxide, which are not the same as the ice that forms glaciers. Only option (B) correctly states that glaciers are made from the same substance as steam, which is water in its gaseous state."
