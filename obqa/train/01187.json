Traits such as the shape of the nose can be passed along through the reproduction process and the transfer of genetic material. This is because traits are determined by genes, which are segments of DNA that are inherited from parents. Option (B) is incorrect because thoughts are not encoded in our genetic material and cannot be directly passed on to offspring. Option (C) is also incorrect because money is a human construct and not a biological trait that can be inherited. Option (D) is related to learned behaviors and not directly tied to genetic material."
