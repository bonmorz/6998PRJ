The question implies that human activity has negative consequences for some living things (such as the loss of waterways and forest lands), but also has benefits for other living things. Option (A) is correct because rats and roaches are known to thrive in environments that have been altered by human activity, such as urban areas and buildings. They have adapted to human settlements and have access to food and shelter. Option (B) is incorrect because saunas and pools are not living things. Option (C) is unrelated and does not make sense in the context of the question. Option (D) is also incorrect because it does not provide any evidence of how human activity benefits living things."
