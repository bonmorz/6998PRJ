Bears are primarily herbivorous and obtain fiber from plant-based foods, such as leaves. Option (A) is incorrect because meat does not contain fiber. Option (B) is incorrect because fish is also not a source of fiber. Option (C) is incorrect because water does not provide fiber. Thus, the correct answer is option (D), as masticating leaves allows bears to consume more fiber."
