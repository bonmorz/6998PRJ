A picnic is an outdoor activity that usually takes place during the day when the sun is up and the weather is pleasant. Option (A) is the correct answer because during the day, there is sunlight and warmer temperatures, making it suitable for a picnic. Option (B) is incorrect because it is typically dark at night and not the ideal time for a picnic. Option (C) is incorrect because during an extinction event, it is unlikely that anyone would be having a picnic. Option (D) is incorrect because during an Ice Age, the climate would be very cold and not conducive to outdoor activities like picnics."
