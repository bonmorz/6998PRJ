Hawks are predatory birds that commonly eat lizards as part of their diet. When there is an increase in the number of hawks in an area, it is likely that the population of lizards will decrease. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) their kind will dwindle. Option (A) is incorrect because an increase in hawks is likely to have a negative effect on the lizard population.
