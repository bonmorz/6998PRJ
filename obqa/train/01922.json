Lightning is a natural electrical discharge caused by the buildup and release of electrical energy in the atmosphere. It is often associated with thunderstorms and is often seen during rainfall. Rainfall occurs when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses into droplets and falls to the ground. In thunderstorms, the updrafts and downdrafts within the storm cloud cause water droplets and ice crystals to collide and create electrical charges. These charges can then lead to the formation of lightning. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer as lightning can be a combustion of rain and ice.
