Canyons are formed by erosion caused by water or wind, so it is common to find different types of sedimentary rocks such as granite, sandstone, and limestone in canyons. Squid, on the other hand, are marine animals and are unlikely to be found in a canyon, as canyons are typically not connected to bodies of water where squid would reside. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer."
