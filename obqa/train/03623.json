When a flag such as the American flag (commonly referred to as \"Old Glory\") is attached to a flagpole, it is typically raised and lowered using a pulley system. The pulley allows for the flag to be easily moved up and down the pole, causing it to wave in the wind. Option (B) is incorrect because magic does not have any physical basis for causing a flag to wave. Option (C) is unrealistic because it implies that a person is manually climbing the flagpole to make the flag wave. Option (D) is incorrect because birds do not have the physical capabilities to manipulate a flag in such a way."
