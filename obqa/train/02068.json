When plant life decays over a long period of time, it can transform into fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. These fossil fuels can be used to fuel machines like motorcycles. Option (A) is incorrect because nuclear power plants use uranium as fuel, not long decayed plant life. Option (B) is incorrect because dogs do not use plant life as fuel. Option (D) is incorrect because our bodies do not consume plant life as fuel."
