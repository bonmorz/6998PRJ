When acid is spilled on a plant, it can cause damage to the plant's cells and tissues, leading to a chemical reaction that may produce smoke.

Option (D) is incorrect because growth in plants is a result of several factors including sunlight, water, and nutrients, and acid exposure is unlikely to cause significant growth."
