Xylem is a complex tissue in plants that is responsible for the transport of water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. Among the options given, only the saguaro cactus is a plant, and therefore the only organism that uses xylem for materials transport. Liverwort and sphagnum moss are non-vascular plants and do not have xylem. Green algae are not plants and do not have specialized transport tissues like xylem.
