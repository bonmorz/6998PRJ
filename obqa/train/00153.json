When the wheels are squealing, it means that there is a lot of friction between the wheels and the blacktop. This friction works against the motion of the wheels, making it harder for them to move forward. Option (B) is incorrect because friction does not stop motion completely, it just makes it more difficult. Option (C) is also incorrect because friction does not remove forward motion, it just makes it more challenging to maintain it.
