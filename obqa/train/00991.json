When we breathe in oxygen, our body uses it and exhales CO2 as waste. However, if the boy sleeps with heavy blankets over his head, the blankets can trap the exhaled CO2 and prevent fresh oxygen from entering. This can lead to a buildup of CO2 in the area around the boy's face, which can be dangerous and potentially fatal. Option (A) is incorrect because beds themselves do not cause issues with breathing, it is the specific action of covering the head with heavy blankets that is the concern. Option (B) is incorrect because breathing at night is not inherently deadly, but rather the lack of fresh oxygen due to the blankets can be problematic.
