Option (A), the snow on one's car, is likely to be cold rather than hot. Option (C), a rainbow sherbet cone, is frozen dessert and also likely to be cold. Option (D), a cup of iced tea, has ice in it, which suggests that it is cold as well. \n\nThis leaves us with option (B), a recently used iron. An iron is typically used for pressing clothes and it generates heat to remove wrinkles. When an iron is recently used, it retains heat and can be hot to the touch. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer as the recently used iron is likely to be the hottest among the given options."
