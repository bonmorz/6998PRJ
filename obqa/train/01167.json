Option (A) is correct because it states that a light switch turns on lights because of steel inside the wiring. Steel is a good conductor of electricity, so it allows the flow of electric current to power the lights. Option (B) is incorrect because aluminum is also a good conductor of electricity, so it would not cause a toaster to fail. Option (C) is incorrect because a faulty connection would cause a lightbulb to not work, but it is not related to the wiring requiring an electrical conductor. Option (D) is incorrect because a power outage due to an electrical storm is not related to the wiring itself, but rather external factors like lightning strikes."

An electrical conductor is a material that allows the flow of electric current. In this case, we are looking for an example of wiring that requires an electrical conductor.\n\nOption (A) states that a light switch turns on lights because of steel inside the wiring. Steel is a good electrical conductor, so this option is correct. The steel inside the wiring allows the electric current to flow from the switch to the lights, completing the circuit and turning on the lights.\n\nOption (B) states that a toasting fails because it used aluminum. Aluminum is also a good electrical conductor, so this option does not give an example of wiring requiring an electrical conductor.\n\nOption (C) states that a lightbulb burns out because of a faulty connection. This option does not specifically mention the need for an electrical conductor in the wiring, so it is not the correct answer.\n\nOption (D) states that a power outage occurs because of an electrical storm. While an electrical storm can cause a power outage, it does not specifically describe wiring requiring an electrical conductor.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is (A) because it gives an example of wiring where the electrical conductor (steel) is necessary for the flow of electric current."
