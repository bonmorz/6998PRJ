Option (A) is incorrect because simply watching educational programs does not involve active investigation or analysis. Option (B) is also incorrect because while specialists may discuss topics with laymen, this is not the primary way they gather information. Option (D) is incorrect because making notes in books does not necessarily involve actively inspecting and considering information. The correct answer is (C) because specialists actively inspect their surroundings, take notes, and consider their observations in order to better understand the world around them."
