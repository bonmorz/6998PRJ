Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin when it is exposed to sunlight. However, for a person with a vitamin D deficiency who is allergic to sunlight, they cannot rely on sunlight for vitamin D production. Therefore, the best alternative source of vitamin D would be through their diet. Option (D), eating more cheese, is a good choice as cheese is a dietary source of vitamin D. Option (A), looking at pictures, is not a viable solution as it does not provide any vitamin D. Option (B), drinking more water, and option (C), bathing more often, are unrelated to the synthesis or intake of vitamin D."
