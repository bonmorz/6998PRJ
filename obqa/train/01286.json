Option (A) is correct because genes can determine physical traits, such as the appearance of hair. Option (B) is incorrect because genes do not directly cause a baby to become chubby, but rather can influence metabolism and predispose certain individuals to weight gain. Option (C) is incorrect because genes do not directly cause a horse to break its leg, but rather can influence bone strength and susceptibility to injury. Option (D) is incorrect because genes do not directly attack viruses and bacteria, but rather can play a role in the immune response and the body's ability to fight off infections."
