The accurate scenario is that the Earth travels around the Sun. This is known as the heliocentric model, which was proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus in the 16th century and is widely accepted in modern science. Option (A) is incorrect because it suggests a geocentric model, which was the commonly held belief before Copernicus. Option (B) is a distractor.
