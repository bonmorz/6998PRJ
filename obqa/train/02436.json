The warmest part of the year happens when the hemisphere of a region is tilted towards the sun. This is because when a hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, the sunlight hits that hemisphere more directly, causing more heat and warmth. Option (A) is incorrect because the presence of a comet does not directly affect the temperature. Option (B) is incorrect because the visibility of mercury in the sky does not directly correlate with the warmth of the year. Option (D) is also incorrect because when a hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, the sunlight hits at a less direct angle, resulting in cooler temperatures."
