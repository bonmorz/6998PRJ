Option (A) states that if people keep the puppy outside lacking protection, it may be taken away. This is because leaving a puppy outside without proper protection can expose it to various risks such as extreme weather conditions, predators, or accidents. This can be considered neglectful behavior, which may lead to the puppy being taken away by animal welfare authorities.\n\nOptions (B), (C), and (D) all describe positive actions towards the puppy. Playing with it affectionately, feeding it quality food, and giving it clean water are all responsible and caring actions that contribute to the well-being of the puppy. None of these actions would typically lead to the puppy being taken away.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is the correct answer as it identifies a behavior that could result in the removal of the puppy. The other options describe actions that are beneficial to the puppy and would not lead to its removal."

This option does not make sense because playing with a puppy affectionately is generally seen as a positive behavior that promotes bonding and socialization.
