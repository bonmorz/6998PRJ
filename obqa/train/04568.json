Ecologically minded individuals prioritize sustainability, renewable energy, and minimizing negative impacts on the environment. Option (A) windmills, also known as wind turbines, are a source of renewable energy that harnesses the power of the wind to generate electricity. Wind energy is considered clean and sustainable, making it a popular choice among environmentally conscious individuals. Option (B) oil is a non-renewable resource that has significant negative environmental impacts, including air and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and habitat destruction. Option (C) fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a process of extracting natural gas and oil from underground rock formations. Fracking has been associated with various environmental issues, including groundwater pollution and the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Option (D) gas refers to natural gas, which is also a fossil fuel and non-renewable resource that contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.
