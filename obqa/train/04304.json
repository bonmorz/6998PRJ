The process of photosynthesis converts sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen, which allows plants to grow. Option (B) is incorrect because it refers to the Earth's rotation, which is not related to photosynthesis. Option (C) is incorrect because flying in the sky does not involve the conversion of sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose. Option (D) is incorrect because living in caves does not involve the process of photosynthesis. Option (A) is the correct answer as it accurately describes the process of photosynthesis and how plants use it to grow."
