While all of the options have the potential to start a fire, option (A) electricity is the correct answer because it can be generated by lightning strikes. Lightning is a common cause of forest fires, especially in dry and thunderstorm-prone areas. Option (B) is incorrect because while a bird may accidentally start a fire by carrying a flaming object, it is not as common as lightning. Option (C) and option (D) are possible causes of fires, but they are less common than natural sources such as lightning."
