When an octopus wants to hide or escape from predators, it can expel a dark fluid called ink. This ink creates a cloud that helps to obscure the octopus' location and acts as a temporary cover. Options (A) and (D) are incorrect because ink is not used to spread smell or to paint camouflage. Option (B) is also incorrect because octopuses do not specifically hide in dark, inky caves, but rather use their ink as a defense mechanism in various environments."
