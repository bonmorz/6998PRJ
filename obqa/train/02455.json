Therefore, they receive less sunlight compared to locations near the equator. These countries also experience long winter nights when the sun does not rise for extended periods.\n\nMorocco (option B) is closer to the equator and benefits from being in a more tropical region. It receives a higher amount of sunlight throughout the year compared to the other options.
