This is because the water molecules are able to surround and separate the individual carbohydrate molecules, allowing them to disperse evenly throughout the water. Iron (B), oil (C), and plastic (D) do not easily dissolve in water. Iron may rust when exposed to water, but it does not dissolve. Oil and plastic are hydrophobic, meaning they do not mix well with water and do not dissolve in it."

When combined with water, sugar molecules interact with the water molecules, which causes the sugar to dissolve and form a homogenous solution. Iron, oil, and plastic, on the other hand, are not soluble in water. Iron is a metal and does not have the necessary properties to dissolve in water. Oil is non-polar and hydrophobic, meaning it does not mix well with water. Plastic is also non-polar and does not have the necessary properties to dissolve in water."
