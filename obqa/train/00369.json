When a spark grows, it can ignite flammable materials such as bark and canopies of trees, leading to a fire that tears through an area of nature. This is the most logical answer because fires often consume vegetation and spread through forests and mountains. Option (B) is incorrect because a crystal lake is a body of water and is not consumed by fire. Option (C) is unlikely because a snowy mountaintop would have less flammable material to fuel a fire.
