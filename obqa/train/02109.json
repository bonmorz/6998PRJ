Pebbles are not suitable for planting seeds because they lack the necessary nutrients and moisture retention capacity. However, over time, weathering processes like erosion, deposition, and biological activity break down the pebbles into smaller particles, creating soil. Option (B) is incorrect because light rain alone may not provide enough water to break down the pebbles. Option (C) is also incorrect because cloudy days do not directly contribute to the formation of soil. Option (D) is not related to soil formation, as singing does not have any effect on transforming pebbles into soil."
