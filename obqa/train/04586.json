The most likely reason for the baby bear having golden fur is that the gene contributors shared that characteristic. Inheritable traits, such as fur color and length, are passed down from parents to offspring through genes. Option (B) is incorrect because the fact that the baby bear has golden fur does not necessarily mean its parents are polar bears. Option (C) is unrelated to fur color. Option (D) is also incorrect because if the parents all have black fur, it is unlikely that the baby bear would have golden fur."
