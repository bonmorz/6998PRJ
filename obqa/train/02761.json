A chemical change involves a substance undergoing a chemical reaction and forming a new substance with different properties. Option (A) is correct because when milk is turned into yogurt, it undergoes a chemical reaction involving the bacteria in the yogurt culture fermenting the lactose in the milk, leading to structural and chemical changes. Option (B) is incorrect because mixing marbles is a physical change, not a chemical change. Option (C) is a reference to a band and not related to chemical changes.
