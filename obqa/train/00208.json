Huskies are known for their thick double coat, which they shed heavily twice a year. Option (C) is the correct answer because it accurately describes the side effect of having a Husky as a pet- it takes hours to vacuum all of the fur. Option (A) is incorrect because it is not mentioned whether the dog enjoys being washed out or not. Option (B) is subjective and not related to the shedding of fur. Option (D) is incorrect because when a Husky sheds, the fur typically falls off and is not still attached to the skin."
