When large trees are present, they have dense leaves and branches that create a canopy, blocking sunlight from reaching the lower areas beneath them. Option (A) is incorrect because mountains are usually taller than trees and would not be blocked by them. Option (B) is incorrect because trees do not have the ability to block sunlight from reaching oceans. Option (C) is incorrect because trees cannot block sunlight from reaching clouds, as clouds are located higher in the atmosphere."
