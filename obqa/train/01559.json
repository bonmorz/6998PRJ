A windmill converts wind energy into mechanical energy, which in turn can be used to generate electrical energy. This energy can be used to charge electrons, which is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because windmills do not directly convert wind energy into food. Option (B) is also incorrect because windmills do not produce music. Option (C) is incorrect because while windmills can be considered a form of architecture, they do not directly convert wind energy into architecture."
