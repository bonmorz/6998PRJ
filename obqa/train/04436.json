This is an essential process for plant reproduction and the survival of many species. It has a positive impact on nature and the health of the Earth.\n\nOption (D), watered gardens, refers to the act of providing water to gardens or plants. While this is generally beneficial for plant growth, it does not necessarily have a significant impact on nature or the health of the Earth overall.\n\nBased on the negative impact it can have on the environment, heaped refuse (option A) is the correct answer in this context."
