One of the primary goals of a flower is to produce offspring through the process of pollination and fertilization. Option (A) is incorrect because flowers do not produce carbon dioxide, they actually produce oxygen through photosynthesis. Option (B) is incorrect because flowers do not typically \"deroot\" and die, their life cycle includes stages of growth, blooming, and eventually wilting or shedding seeds. Option (D) is incorrect because flowers have evolved to produce offspring, so remaining sterile is not aligned with their reproductive goals."
