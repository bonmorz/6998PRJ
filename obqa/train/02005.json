When a cow eats food, it goes through a series of compartments in its stomach, where it is broken down, dissolved, and further processed. Option (B) is correct because the food is dissolved in the cow's stomach. Option (A) is incorrect because rotting implies decomposition, which is not part of the digestive process. Option (C) is incorrect because melting typically refers to a change in state from solid to liquid, which does not occur in the cow's stomach. Option (D) is incorrect because the food does not grow inside the cow's stomach."
