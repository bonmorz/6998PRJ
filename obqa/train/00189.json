When there is more light in an area, such as from streetlights or buildings, it creates a phenomenon known as light pollution. This excess light makes it more difficult to see the stars, as the brightness from the artificial sources outshines the faint light emitted by the stars. Option (B) is incorrect because rain does not affect star visibility. Option (C) is incorrect because when light is lessened or reduced in an area, it actually makes it easier to see the stars.
