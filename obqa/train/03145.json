Option (C), \"fall apart,\" is a misleading choice as recycling does not involve things falling apart, but rather transforming old materials into new ones. Option (D), \"be destroyed,\" is also incorrect as the purpose of recycling is to prevent destruction by reusing and reducing waste. Only option (B), \"heal,\" aligns with the positive impact of recycling on the environment, as it helps heal and reduce the negative effects of resource consumption and waste production."
