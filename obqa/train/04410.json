Legless creatures that burrow in soil are commonly known as earthworms. Earthworms create a series of small holes in the soil as they burrow, which help with aeration and drainage of the soil. Options (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect because frogs, moles, and salamanders all have legs and do not typically burrow in soil like earthworms do."
