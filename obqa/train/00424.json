Seed dispersal occurs when the plant's seeds are moved away from the parent plant, increasing the chances of the seeds germinating in a new location. Option (A) is the correct answer because when seeds are sold to a person in another country, they are being moved away from the parent plant and potentially dispersed in a new environment. Option (B) is incorrect because genetic modification does not necessarily contribute to seed dispersal. Option (C) is incorrect because seed destruction by radiation does not involve dispersal. Option (D) is incorrect because planting seeds in the same garden does not involve dispersal away from the parent plant."
