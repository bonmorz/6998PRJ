Many animals go through a process called metamorphosis, where they undergo a complete change in appearance during a particular stage of their life cycle. Option (A) correctly identifies this stage as metamorphosing. Option (B) is unrelated to the topic, as metal does not refer to a stage in an animal's life cycle. Option (C) does not make sense in the context of the question. Option (D) is also unrelated, as drawing has no relation to the life cycle of an animal."
