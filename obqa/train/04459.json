When Max mixed the orange flavored powder in water until it was fully dissolved, the water took on the flavor of the orange. Therefore, when his sister tasted it, it would taste like a citrus fruit, option (C). Option (A) is incorrect because it suggests the taste of cola, which is unrelated to the orange flavor. Option (B) suggests the taste of dark chocolate milk, which is also unrelated to the orange flavor. Option (D) suggests a combination of lemon and apple flavors, which is not consistent with the orange flavor that was mixed in the water."

Based on this information, we need to determine what it tasted like. Option (C) states that it tasted like a citrus fruit, which is the correct answer. \n\nStep 1: We need to analyze the information given in the question. Max mixed orange flavored powder in water until it was dissolved. This means that the water absorbed the flavor of the orange powder and became infused with its taste.\n\nStep 2: The question mentions that Max's sister tasted it. It is implied that Max's sister would be able to detect the taste of the orange in the water.\n\nStep 3: Option (A) states that it tasted like cola. There is no mention of cola in the question, so this option can be eliminated.\n\nStep 4: Option (B) states that it tasted like dark chocolate milk. There is no mention of chocolate or milk in the question, so this option can be eliminated.\n\nStep 5: Option (C) states that it tasted like a citrus fruit. This option aligns with the information given in the question, as Max mixed orange flavored powder. Oranges are citrus fruits, so this option is the most likely answer.\n\nStep 6: Option (D) states that it tasted like lemons and apples. While lemons and apples can be citrus fruits, there is no mention of lemons or apples in the question. This option can be eliminated.\n\nStep 7: Considering all the options, option (C) is the best answer. Max mixed orange flavored powder in water, and his sister tasted it and found that it tasted like a citrus fruit."
