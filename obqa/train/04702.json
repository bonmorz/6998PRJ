Option (A) is correct because animals may leave their environment in response to a hurricane or any other natural disaster that poses a threat to their survival.

Hurricanes can cause significant destruction and disruption to an ecosystem, including flooding, strong winds, and destruction of habitats. Animals may be forced to leave their environment to seek safety and find new food and shelter resources. \n\nOption (B) states that temperature would be a reason for animals to leave their environment. Extreme temperatures, such as excessive heat or extreme cold, can indeed cause animals to migrate or seek shelter in different areas. However, this option is not as comprehensive as option (A), as it does not encompass other factors that may cause animals to leave their environment.\n\nOption (C) states that predators would be a reason for animals to leave their environment. While the presence of predators may cause some animals to flee or hide, it does not necessarily mean they would leave their entire environment. Animals may adapt by changing their behaviors or seeking refuge in specific areas within their environment.\n\nOption (D) states that illness would be a reason for animals to leave their environment. Although illness can affect individual animals, it is not typically a reason for animals to leave their entire environment. Sick animals may seek shelter or isolate themselves to recover, but they generally remain in their familiar surroundings.\n\nTherefore, the most comprehensive and accurate answer is option (A) as hurricanes can cause significant disruption to an environment and force animals to leave in search of safety and resources."
