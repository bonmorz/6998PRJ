During photosynthesis, plants require access to sunlight in order to produce energy through the process of photosynthesis. Option (A) suggests that the plant needs access to roofless space, which allows sunlight to reach the plant's leaves for photosynthesis. Options (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because they imply a lack of sunlight or a dark environment, which would prevent or limit photosynthesis."
