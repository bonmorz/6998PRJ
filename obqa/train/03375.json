Windows are made of materials that allow light to pass through, so they do not absorb much light. Space is a vacuum, so it does not contain any matter to absorb light. Glass is a transparent material that allows light to pass through, but it may absorb some light depending on the specific type and thickness of the glass.

Windows can absorb light through the glass and frame. Glass can absorb some light depending on its composition.
