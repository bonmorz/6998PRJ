A closed circuit is one in which there is a complete and uninterrupted path for the flow of electric current. Option (A) is incorrect because a closed circuit can still be turned on or off by a switch that controls the flow of current. Option (C) is incorrect because a closed circuit has a single path for the current to flow.
