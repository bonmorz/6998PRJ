To determine the answer, we need to consider the environmental impact of each type of energy source. \n\nOption (A) Coal is not environmentally friendly. Burning coal releases large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Coal mining also has negative impacts on ecosystems and water quality.\n\nOption (B) Petroleum, or oil, is also not environmentally friendly. The extraction and transportation of oil can lead to oil spills, which can be damaging to marine habitats and wildlife. Burning oil also releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere.\n\nOption (C) Natural gas is often considered a cleaner energy source compared to coal and petroleum. It produces less carbon dioxide and air pollutants when burned. However, the extraction process, such as hydraulic fracturing or fracking, can have negative environmental impacts, such as water pollution and habitat destruction.\n\nOption (D) Sunlight is the most environmentally friendly energy source. Solar energy is renewable and does not produce any air or water pollution during operation. The use of solar panels to capture sunlight for electricity production has minimal impact on the environment. It is a sustainable and clean source of energy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Sunlight because it is the most environmentally friendly type of energy."

The extraction process of natural gas, such as hydraulic fracturing or \"fracking,\" can have negative environmental impacts such as water contamination and habitat disruption.\n\n(D) Sunlight: Sunlight, or solar energy, is the most environmentally friendly option among these choices. Solar energy does not produce greenhouse gas emissions during operation. It utilizes a renewable source of energy, the sun, which is abundant and does not deplete natural resources. Solar panels used to capture solar energy can be installed on rooftops or in large solar farms, minimizing land disruption. While there are some environmental considerations in the production of solar panels, the overall impact is much lower compared to the extraction and burning of fossil fuels.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (D) Sunlight is the most environmentally friendly type of energy."
