Sunlight is present during the day as it is the primary source of light and energy for the Earth. At night, the sun is not visible, and therefore sunlight is not present. Option (A) is incorrect because the moon is not always visible during the day. Option (C) is incorrect because clouds can be present during both the day and night. Option (D) is incorrect because planets can be visible in the night sky."
