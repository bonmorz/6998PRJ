In the desert, water and moisture are very scarce, and cacti have evolved to store water in their stems. This allows them to survive in arid environments where other plants would not be able to. Therefore, the cactus serves as a rare source of moisture in the desert. Option (A) is incorrect because cacti are not typically a food source for animals or humans. Option (B) is also incorrect because cacti do not provide significant shelter compared to other desert flora like trees or bushes. Option (D) is incorrect because cacti do not provide shade due to their spiky and often small structure."
