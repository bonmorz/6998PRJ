A microscope is a tool used to magnify and observe small objects or details that cannot be seen with the naked eye. Option (A) is incorrect because an elephant is too large to be observed with a microscope. Option (B) is incorrect because observing the sun directly can damage the eyes and a microscope is not used for this purpose. Option (C) is incorrect because a mouse eating food would require a different type of observation. Option (D) is the correct answer because a microscope can be used to observe and see the pores in a plant, which are too small to be seen without magnification."
