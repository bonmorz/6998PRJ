Horses do not sweat in the same way humans do - instead, they sweat through sweat glands located in their skin. When a horse is outside alone in the middle of summer on a sunny day in a desert, it will be sweating to regulate its body temperature and cool down. Therefore, the wetness is coming from the horse's sweat glands. Option (A) is incorrect because orange juice has nothing to do with the horse's wetness.
