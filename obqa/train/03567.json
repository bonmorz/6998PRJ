The best reason for squirrels vacating their forest would be if the forest is being harvested for lumber. Squirrels rely on trees for shelter, food, and protection, so if the trees are being cut down, it would make sense for them to leave the forest. Option (A) is incorrect because the presence of chipmunks does not necessarily mean that squirrels would vacate the forest. Option (C) is also incorrect because the abundance of acorns would actually be a reason for squirrels to stay in the forest. Option (D) is not a valid reason and seems to be a humorous distractor."

Option (C) suggests that the abundance of acorns is the reason for vacating, but squirrels typically rely on acorns as a food source, so this option does not make sense. Option (D) suggests that the squirrels want to start a new life, but this is a speculative and subjective reason that cannot be objectively determined. \n\nOption (B) states that the forest is being harvested for lumber. This option provides a concrete reason that directly affects the squirrels' habitat. If the forest is being cut down and trees are being removed for lumber, this would disturb the squirrels' natural habitat and force them to vacate the forest.
