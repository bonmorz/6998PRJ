When a piece of paper falls into a moving river, it will usually be carried along by the current and relocated to a new location downstream. Option (A) is incorrect because paper cannot scream. Option (B) may be misleading, as \"flies\" typically refers to objects that move through the air, not water. Option (C) is unlikely because paper is typically buoyant and will float on the water's surface before eventually becoming waterlogged and sinking. Therefore, option (D) is the correct choice."
