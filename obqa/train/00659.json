Deep sea animals produce light through bioluminescence as a means of catching prey. The light they emit helps to attract smaller organisms, which are then consumed by the deep sea animal. Option (A) is not correct because navigation in the deep sea is primarily achieved through other sensory mechanisms such as echolocation. Option (B) is incorrect because deep sea animals often live in complete darkness and do not require camouflage. Option (C) is also incorrect because deep sea animals do not use light for sexual display as they are often isolated and have other means of reproduction."
