The layers of sediment can compress the tree and preserve its shape, forming future imprints in rock known as petrified wood. Option (B) is a humorous choice, but is not related to fossil formation. Option (C) is a brand of toilet paper and not related to fossil formation. Option (D) is also possible, as fallen trees can wash up on a beach and leave behind footprints, but the question specifies that the tree gets covered in mud and forms something, so the most direct answer is (A)."
