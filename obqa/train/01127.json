In this context, \"physically\" implies a tangible or visual representation of the memories. Options (A), (C), and (D) do not provide a visual representation of memories.\n\nOption (A) suggests bringing a phone, which can capture photos and videos, but it does not guarantee a physical representation of the memories unless the woman chooses to print the photos or videos later.\n\nOption (C) suggests bringing a book, which may help her remember the day if she writes down her experiences or thoughts, but a book does not provide a visual representation of memories.\n\nOption (D) suggests bringing a lunch, which has no relevance to physically looking back over memories.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is (B), bringing a camera. A camera allows the woman to capture visual images of the day, providing a physical representation of her memories that she can look back on whenever she wants."
