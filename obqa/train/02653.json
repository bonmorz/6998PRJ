This is because water, over a long period of time, can wear away the rough edges and surfaces of rocks, resulting in a smoother texture. Option (A) is incorrect because the sound of thunder has no direct impact on the smoothness of rocks. Option (C) is also incorrect because although wind can erode rocks, it typically does not smooth them as much as water does. Option (D) is unrelated to the question and is a distractor answer."

Rocks become smooth through a process called erosion, which is caused by the movement of water or wind over the surface of the rocks.
