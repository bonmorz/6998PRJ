The Gobi Desert is a desert located in Asia, known for its extreme dryness. The arctic tundra, the Salton Sea, and the rain forest all have higher levels of moisture compared to the Gobi Desert. The arctic tundra is characterized by low temperatures and frozen ground, but it still has some moisture due to snow and ice. The Salton Sea is a shallow, saline lake and while it may have some areas of dry land, it doesn't compare to the aridity of a desert. The rain forest, as the name suggests, receives abundant rainfall and is not considered a dry environment. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."
