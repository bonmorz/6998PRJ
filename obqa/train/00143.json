Since the scientist completed his new invention, it suggests that he relied on his observation skills to gather information and make the necessary observations to successfully create the invention. Option (A) is the correct answer because the scientist would thank his powers of observation for helping him complete his invention. Option (B) is incorrect because luck is unrelated to the scientist's abilities and efforts. Option (C) and (D) are unrelated to the completion of the invention and are more personal or emotional aspects."
