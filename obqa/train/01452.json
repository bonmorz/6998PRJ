Option (B) of limiting animal access may seem counterintuitive, as animals are an important part of the ecosystem.

For example, if the person's land is an important habitat for an endangered species, limiting animal access may be necessary to protect their habitat and ensure their survival. \n\nHowever, option (A) of limiting human access is the better choice for doing something great for the environment. By limiting human access to the land, the person can prevent any detrimental human activities such as illegal logging, pollution, or habitat destruction. This can help preserve the natural state of the land and protect any wildlife that may inhabit it. Additionally, by limiting human access, the person can create a nature reserve or conservation area where the land can be managed effectively for environmental benefits, such as reforestation, wildlife conservation, or sustainable agriculture practices. Overall, limiting human access is a more responsible and proactive approach for someone who wants to do something great for the environment."
