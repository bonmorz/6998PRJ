As the water freezes, it creates pressure on the surrounding material, causing it to crack or break apart. This process is repeated over multiple cycles of freezing and thawing, gradually causing the rock or soil to disintegrate. In this case, the freezing and thawing are caused by the cycles of freezing and thawing of water (H2O).
