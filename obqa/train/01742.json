Option (A) states that an ice hockey arena would be a difficult place to play ice hockey, which is incorrect because ice hockey arenas are specifically designed for the game. Option (C) suggests that a frozen pond would be difficult, but it is a common place for recreational ice hockey. Option (D) suggests an ice rink, which is also designed for the game, so it wouldn't be the most difficult place to play. Option (B), the moon, would be the most difficult place to play ice hockey because the lack of atmosphere and extreme cold temperatures would make it impossible to maintain ice for the game. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."
