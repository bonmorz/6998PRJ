An oil slick is the surface on which a braking car would have the most trouble. Oil creates a slippery surface, reducing the friction between the tires and the road surface. This lack of friction makes it difficult for the car to stop quickly and increases the risk of skidding. Option (A) is incorrect because while gravel can reduce traction, it still provides more friction than an oil slick. Option (C) is incorrect because sand can actually provide some traction and help with braking. Option (D) is incorrect because asphalt provides a good surface for braking with sufficient friction."
