Option (D) is also incorrect because while religion can provide comfort and support, it does not provide physical protection or shelter either. Option (C), a tepee, is the best choice because it can provide both protection from the elements and a form of shelter. A tepee is a portable, conical tent traditionally used by Native American tribes that is designed to withstand various weather conditions.
