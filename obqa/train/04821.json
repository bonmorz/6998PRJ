Cooking food involves the application of heat in order to change its chemical composition and make it edible or more palatable. Option (A) is the correct answer because setting food in the sun can generate enough heat to cook it. Option (B) is incorrect because shaking food does not produce heat. Option (C) is incorrect because putting food in the freezer does not involve heat, but rather lowers the temperature. Option (D) is incorrect because running food under water does not involve heat either."
