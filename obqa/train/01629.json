Farmland is generally used for agricultural purposes and is likely to have crops, animals, and some level of wilderness. On the other hand, housing developments are residential areas with a concentration of houses and infrastructure.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because farmland, by definition, is more likely to have crops compared to housing developments.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because housing developments are human-made areas with minimal wilderness compared to farmland, which may have fields, forests, or other natural areas.\n\nOption (C) is correct because housing developments often have artificial lighting, streetlights, and illuminated buildings, which can contribute to light pollution. Farmland, although it may have some lighting for agricultural purposes, is generally less affected by light pollution compared to housing developments.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because farmland is more likely to have a variety of animals compared to housing developments, which are typically designed for human habitation and may have limited wildlife presence."

Farmland is an area where crops are grown, so option (A) is incorrect because an area with housing developments would not have as many crops as a farmland. Option (B) is also incorrect because housing developments typically replace wilderness areas. \n\nThe correct answer is option (C), light pollution. Housing developments usually have a higher concentration of artificial lighting, including streetlights, porch lights, and lighting inside homes. This increased artificial lighting leads to light pollution, which can have negative effects on wildlife, including disruption of their normal behaviors like migration patterns and breeding cycles. Options (D) is also not the best answer because while some animals may still be present in housing developments, their populations tend to be lower compared to farmland areas due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
