Option (B) is the correct answer because head size is a heritable trait that can be influenced by genetic factors. Options (A), (C), and (D) are not directly determined by genetics. Hobbies enjoyed can be influenced by personal interests, number of friends can be influenced by social interactions, and sports played can be influenced by personal preferences and opportunities for participation."
