Gas can be used multiple times in a car as long as there is a sufficient amount in the fuel tank. Option (A) is incorrect because gas can be used multiple times before it runs out. Option (B) is subjective and not a valid reason for conserving gas. Option (C) is partially correct, as the more gas is used, the more it costs to refill the tank, but this is not the primary reason for conserving gas. Option (D) is incorrect because gas does not typically \"mess up\" car engines.
