Anti-bacterial soap can cause more harm than good when used because it contains chemicals, such as triclosan, that can contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. This means that over time, the bacteria become less susceptible to the effects of the soap and can become more difficult to kill. Option (A) and (D) are not related to the potential harm caused by certain products. Option (B) is incorrect because hybrid cars are generally considered to be more environmentally friendly and beneficial than traditional cars due to their lower emissions."

Option (C) is the correct answer because antibacterial soap can actually contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance and disrupt the balance of good bacteria on our skin. This can lead to the growth of harmful bacteria and increase the risk of infections. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because hiking boots are designed to provide support and protection while hiking, and when used properly, they can prevent injuries and provide a safer hiking experience. \n\nOption (B) is incorrect because hybrid cars are typically seen as more environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional gasoline-powered cars. They produce fewer emissions and help reduce air pollution, which is beneficial for the environment and human health. \n\nOption (D) is incorrect because bikes are a mode of transportation that promote physical activity and are generally considered beneficial for health and the environment."
