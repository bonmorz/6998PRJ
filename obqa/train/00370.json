Anteaters primarily eat ants and termites, and they use their long noses and tongues to reach into anthills and termite mounds. Therefore, it is most likely that an anteater would live near an anthill, as it provides a plentiful supply of food. Options (A), (C), and (D) are less likely because they do not typically provide the same food source that an anthill does."

An anteater is a mammal that primarily feeds on ants and termites, so it would most likely live near an anthill where it can easily find and eat its preferred food source. Option (A) is incorrect because while an anteater may occasionally come across ants near a swamp, it is not their primary habitat. Option (C) is also incorrect because anteaters do not typically live near rivers. Option (D) is incorrect because anteaters do not eat bees or live near beehives."
