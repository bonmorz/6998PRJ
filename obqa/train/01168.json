Coconut oil is a solid at room temperature, but it has a relatively low melting point, so it will start to liquify as the temperature rises. Therefore, option (A), which states that the oil changes from solid to wet, is the correct answer. Option (B) is incorrect because as the temperature increases, the oil will become less solid, not harder. Option (C) is incorrect because coconut oil is not prone to rotting.
