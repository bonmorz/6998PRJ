Evaporation is the process by which a liquid, such as water, changes into a gas due to the heat energy from the sun.

As the sun heats up the jars, the Gatorade will evaporate at different rates depending on the liquid level. Option (B) is unrelated to evaporation and more related to politics. Option (C) is impossible as humans cannot physically walk on the sun due to its extremely high temperatures.
