The circulatory system consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. Arteries are a type of blood vessel that carries oxygenated blood away from the heart and distributes it to all parts of the body. Nutrients are transported through the body via the bloodstream, facilitated by the arteries. \n\nOption (B) is incorrect because the lungs are responsible for oxygenating the blood, not for transporting nutrients. Option (C) is incorrect because knees are a joint and have no role in nutrient transportation. Option (D) is incorrect because eyes are sensory organs and not involved in nutrient circulation."
