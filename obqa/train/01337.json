When a person wants to show that they have lost money with their business, they would use a graph that shows ups and downs. The ups and downs on the graph would indicate the fluctuations or changes in the financial status of the business, where ups represent positive financial growth and downs represent financial loss. Option (A) is incorrect because if the graph showed more money, it would indicate financial gain rather than loss. Option (B) is unrelated to the purpose of showing financial loss. Option (C) is unrelated to the purpose of showing financial loss and is just a random element mentioned."
