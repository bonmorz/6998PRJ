In general, smaller and lighter birds are able to fly more easily than larger and heavier birds. Therefore, a bird that weighs twenty pounds will still be able to fly easier than a bird that weighs twenty-four pounds. Option (B) is incorrect because a bird that weighs ten pounds will be lighter and therefore able to fly even easier. Options (C) and (D) are also incorrect because both weights are greater than twenty pounds, making it more difficult for the birds to fly."
