Peonies are flowering plants that rely on pollinators to transfer pollen from the male parts of the flower to the female parts in order to produce seeds and fruits.\n\nOut of the options given, the animal that most commonly interacts with peonies and aids in pollination is a bee. Bees are attracted to the bright colors and sweet scent of peonies, and they collect nectar from the flowers while inadvertently picking up and transferring pollen. As they move from flower to flower, bees help in the cross-pollination process, increasing the chances of successful reproduction in peonies.\n\nOption (A), humans, can also interact with peonies, but their role in pollination is minimal compared to bees. Humans may cultivate peonies and provide the right conditions for them to grow, but they do not play a significant role in pollinating peonies.\n\nOptions (C) and (D), elephants and worms, are not typical pollinators for peonies. While there are rare instances where elephants can help in dispersing seeds, they do not actively interact with peonies for pollination. Similarly, worms do not participate in pollination as they primarily reside in the soil and are not attracted to flowers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) bee."
