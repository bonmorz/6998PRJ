When a circuit is left open, it means there is a break or discontinuity in the circuit, and therefore, electricity cannot flow through it. As a result, when the boy goes to turn on the lights, they will fail to turn on because there is no complete circuit for the electricity to travel through. Option (B) is incorrect because success implies that the lights would turn on, which is not the case. Option (C) is also incorrect because shining implies that the lights are on and producing light, which is not possible with an open circuit.
