Whitetail are commonly found in temperate habitats, such as forests and woodlands. Option (A), the ocean, is incorrect because whitetail are land mammals and do not live in the ocean. Option (C), arctic, is not correct because the cold temperatures of the arctic would not be suitable for whitetail. Option (D), desert, is also incorrect because whitetail prefer habitats with ample vegetation, which is typically not found in deserts. The correct answer is option (B), temperate."
