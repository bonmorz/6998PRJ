Option (D), bread, is the correct answer because many types of bread, especially white and processed bread, contain added sugar. Option (A), meat, is incorrect because meat does not contain sugar unless it has been processed with sweet sauces or marinades. Option (B), eggs, is incorrect because eggs do not contain sugar. Option (C), butter, is incorrect because butter does not contain sugar (although some flavored or sweetened spreads may contain sugar)."
