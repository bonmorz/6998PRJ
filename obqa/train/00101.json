Canyons are typically formed over a long period of time through erosion and are known for their large size and stunning beauty. Option (A) is incorrect because canyons are not typically filled with sand, although there may be some sediment at the bottom. Option (B) is also incorrect because although canyons may be home to some wildlife, they are not specifically known for being filled with local wildlife. Option (C) is incorrect because canyons are not typically dirty and muddy inside. Option (D) is correct because canyons are typically formed by the erosion of stone, resulting in their characteristic appearance."
