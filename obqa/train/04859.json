Chemical reactions typically occur when there is a change in temperature, and option (B) states that upper temperatures are applied slowly. This suggests that increasing the temperature slowly can lead to a chemical reaction. Options (A), (C), and (D) do not provide any relevant information about chemical reactions and are therefore incorrect."

Chemical reactions occur when substances interact and undergo a change, usually resulting in the formation of new substances. Option (B) states that upper temperatures are applied slowly, which can increase the likelihood of a chemical reaction occurring. This is because higher temperatures provide more energy for the reactant molecules, making them move faster and collide more frequently, increasing the chances of successful collisions that lead to a chemical reaction. \n\nThe other options (A, C, and D) are incorrect because they do not relate to the conditions necessary for a chemical reaction. Option (A) mentions steam being removed gently, which is an action after the chemical reaction has occurred and does not affect the reaction itself. Option (C) refers to how deer are fed tenderly, which is unrelated to chemical reactions. Option (D) suggests that bees are introduced carefully, but this does not have any influence on chemical reactions either."
