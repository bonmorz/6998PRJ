When the amount of food decreases, there is a higher level of competition between organisms searching for it. This is because there is less food available, so organisms must compete more aggressively to obtain enough resources to survive. Option (A) is incorrect because there will still be conflict between organisms searching for the limited food. Option (B) is untrue because the amount of conflict will increase with decreased food availability. Option (C) is incorrect because as explained above, the amount of conflict will actually go up.
