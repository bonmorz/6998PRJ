If you mow over a weed, it may temporarily cut the above-ground portion, but the root system remains intact, allowing the weed to grow back. Option (B) is correct because pulling the weed by the root removes the entire plant, preventing it from regrowing. Option (A) is incorrect because weeds do not have emotions.
