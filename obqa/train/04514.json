Atmospheric pressure is influenced by weather conditions, specifically changes in air density. Gale-force winds, which are strong and powerful winds, can cause significant changes in air density and therefore have the greatest impact on a barometer. Thunder (option B) is the result of lightning and does not directly impact air density. Light breezes (option C) may have a minor impact on air density, but not as significant as gale-force winds. Lightning (option D) does not directly impact air density and would not have a significant effect on a barometer."
