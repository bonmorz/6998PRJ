When a baby bird pecks at its shell, it is an instinctive behavior that helps it emerge from the shell and hatch. This is necessary for the bird to enter the world and begin its life. Option (B) is incorrect because hiding is a learned behavior and not instinctive. Option (C) is incorrect because eating is also a learned behavior and not instinctive at this early stage. Option (D) is incorrect because the bird needs to emerge from the shell in order to survive and continue its development."
