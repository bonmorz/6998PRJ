Oceans are bodies of water that are affected by the Earth's rotation, but they do not rotate themselves. \n\nOption (B), winds, do not rotate on their axis either. Winds are movements of air caused by differences in temperature and pressure. \n\nOption (D), people, do not rotate on their axis. People have the ability to rotate themselves, but this is not a characteristic of all people and does not refer to a natural phenomenon."
