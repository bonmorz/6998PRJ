Landslides are the sudden movement of rock, debris, or soil down a slope. As a result, they can indeed affect communities. Here's the breakdown:\n\nOption (A): Cars - While landslides can potentially damage or block roads, which can indirectly impact cars, this answer is not the most accurate as landslides do not directly affect cars.\n\nOption (B): The Sun - Landslides are geological phenomena and have no direct link to the sun. Therefore, this answer is not correct.\n\nOption (C): Wind - Similarly to option (B), landslides are not affected by wind, nor do they have any direct relation to it.\n\nOption (D): Communities - This is the correct answer. Landslides can cause significant damage to communities. They can destroy homes, structures, infrastructure like roads or bridges, and even result in loss of life. They can also disrupt essential services and utilities, affecting the overall functioning of a community.\n\nTo summarize, landslides primarily impact communities through property damage, infrastructure destruction, and potential threat to human lives. The other options, such as cars, the sun, and wind, are not directly associated with landslides."
