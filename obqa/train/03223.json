Option (A), folding, means bending the paper to create multiple layers or creases. Option (B), flattening, means making the paper smooth and removing any creases or wrinkles. Option (C), squashing, means compressing the paper together to create a compact, rounded shape like a ball. Option (D), restoring, means returning the paper to its original state, which is not applicable in this case. The correct answer is (C) squashing because it best describes the action of turning a piece of paper into a ball by compressing it together."
