When standing still on a hilltop, Jane's hat could fly off her head due to the phenomenon known as wind. Wind is caused by uneven heating of the ground, which creates pressure differences and results in air moving from high pressure areas to low pressure areas. Option (A) is incorrect because her head blowing the hat off does not align with the laws of physics. Option (C) is unlikely because it is not a natural behavior for a squirrel to jump up and grab a hat off someone's head.
