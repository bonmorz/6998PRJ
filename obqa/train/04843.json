Option (C), a B52 Bomber, uses aviation fuel, which is a nonrenewable resource, to power its engines. Option (A), wind chimes, do not require any energy source and simply move with the power of the wind. Option (B), a solar-powered car, uses sunlight, a renewable resource, to generate electricity. Option (D), a bicycle, does not require any fuel or energy source other than human power. Therefore, option (C) is the only one that uses a nonrenewable resource."

Nonrenewable resources are resources that cannot be replaced or replenished within a human lifespan. Option (C) is the correct answer because a B52 Bomber uses fossil fuels, which are a nonrenewable resource. Wind chimes (option A) do not use any resources, they simply rely on wind to create sound. Solar-powered cars (option B) use solar energy, which is a renewable resource. A bicycle (option D) does not require any external fuel source, so it does not rely on nonrenewable resources."
