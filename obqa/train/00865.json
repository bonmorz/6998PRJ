The waste product of human respiration is carbon dioxide, which is actually a vital resource for plants like daffodils. Plants undergo a process called photosynthesis where they take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen. So, carbon dioxide, the waste product of human respiration, is actually used by plants for their own respiration. Option (A) is incorrect because pigs do not rely on carbon dioxide as a vital resource. Option (C) is incorrect because oceans do not directly utilize carbon dioxide as a vital resource. Option (D) is incorrect because bees do not rely on carbon dioxide as a vital resource."
