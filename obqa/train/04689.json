In the Northern Hemisphere, winter occurs at the same time as summer in the Southern Hemisphere. During winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the days are shorter and there is less sunlight. In contrast, during winter in the Southern Hemisphere, the days are longer and there is more sunlight. Therefore, option (D) is correct, as it accurately describes the correlation between winter in the Northern Hemisphere and long, sunny days in the Southern Hemisphere. Option (A) is incorrect because the seasons in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are opposite. Option (B) is unrelated to the question and refers to fall days rather than winter. Option (C) is also incorrect because the cold months in the Southern Hemisphere occur during their winter, which is during the Northern Hemisphere's summer."
