Pollution refers to the introduction of harmful substances or contaminants into the environment.\n\nOption (A) is the correct answer because throwing things in the ocean, such as plastic bottles or garbage, can lead to pollution. This is because these items can degrade and release pollutants into the water, harming aquatic life and ecosystems.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because buying a new solar panel is a form of sustainable energy and does not contribute to pollution. In fact, it can help reduce pollution by using renewable energy sources.\n\nOption (C) is also incorrect because biking instead of driving a car reduces pollution. Cars emit carbon dioxide and other pollutants, whereas biking is a more environmentally friendly mode of transportation. Biking helps to reduce air pollution, especially in urban areas.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because using old food as compost for plants is a form of recycling and does not contribute to pollution. Composting can enrich the soil and reduce the need for chemical fertilizers, thus reducing pollution from agricultural practices.\n\nTherefore, (A) throwing things in the ocean is the only option that can contribute to pollution."
