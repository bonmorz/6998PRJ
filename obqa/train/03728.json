As they move, glaciers can create depressions in the landscape called cirques or basins. When these depressions fill with water, it forms glacial lakes or pools. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. Option (B) is incorrect because lions do not interact with glaciers in any way. Option (C) is also incorrect because glaciers are made of ice, which is associated with low temperatures. Option (D) is incorrect because glaciers move very slowly and do not change directions rapidly."
