A leopard seal lives in cold, icy waters and has thicker layers of blubber and skin to provide insulation and protection from the cold. Option (A) is incorrect because birds have feathers for insulation, not thick skin. Option (B) is incorrect because scorpions do not have skin layers like mammals. Option (C) is incorrect because lizards do have scales, but they do not have thick skin like a seal would need in cold waters."

Leopard seals are marine mammals that live in cold Antarctic waters. Thicker layers of skin would best suit them because it provides insulation against the cold temperatures. Option (A) is incorrect because birds have feathers which provide insulation and protection, but not thicker layers of skin. Option (B) is incorrect because scorpions are arachnids and have an exoskeleton, not skin. Option (C) is incorrect because lizards are ectothermic reptiles and rely on behavior, such as basking in the sun, to regulate their body temperature."

A bird typically has feathers, which provide insulation and protection, but they do not have thicker layers of skin. A scorpion has an exoskeleton, which is a hard outer covering, but it does not have thicker layers of skin. A lizard is ectothermic, meaning it relies on external sources of heat to regulate its body temperature. While lizards may have scales for protection, they do not have thick layers of skin. A leopard seal, on the other hand, lives in cold Antarctic waters. To withstand the extreme temperatures, they have a thick layer of blubber under their skin, which acts as insulation. This adaptation allows them to survive in the frigid environment, making (D) the correct answer."
