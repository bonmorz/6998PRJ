When an animal's fur grows thicker, it is usually indicative of the animal preparing for colder weather or colder climates. Option (B) suggests that the hemisphere could be facing away from the sun, meaning that the animal is experiencing cooler temperatures and needs thicker fur for insulation. Option (A) is subjective and not based on scientific information. Option (C) is incorrect because if it were summer, the animal would not need thicker fur. Option (D) is also incorrect because thicker fur is typically a sign of adaptation and preparation for colder conditions, not an indication of dying."
