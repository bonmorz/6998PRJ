Flowers produce nectar, which attracts insects like bees and butterflies. These insects then transfer pollen from one flower to another, enabling the plants to reproduce. In the process, the insects feed on the nectar, thus obtaining sustenance from the flowers. Squirrels, on the other hand, do not directly feed on flowers, so options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect.
