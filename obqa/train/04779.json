Animals with pointed teeth, such as carnivores, are more likely to be hunters because their teeth are designed for tearing and chewing meat. Option (A) is incorrect because a long neck does not necessarily indicate hunting ability. Option (C) is incorrect because dense fur does not determine an animal's hunting behavior. Option (D) is incorrect because webbed feet are typically found in animals that are adapted for swimming, not hunting."

Option (C) is unrelated to predation and is instead a characteristic of some animals living in cold climates. Option (D) is also unrelated to predation and is a characteristic of animals adapted to aquatic environments."
