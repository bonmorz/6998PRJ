The slight angle of the Earth's axis is responsible for the changing seasons and the variation in the amount of solar energy received by different countries. Option (A) is a correct answer because the polar areas, such as the Arctic and Antarctic regions, experience extreme variations in daylight and darkness due to the Earth's axis. Option (B) is incorrect because Mars, being a different planet, does not have a human planet axis. Option (C) is incorrect because the angle of the Earth's axis does not directly affect the political status of countries. Therefore, the correct answer is option (D) because all countries on Earth are affected by the energy allotment received due to the axis tilt."
