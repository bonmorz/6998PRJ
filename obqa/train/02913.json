The animal commonly associated with America is the eagle, as it is a symbol of freedom and appears on the country's seal, flag, and currency. The animal on a one dollar bill is an eagle, specifically a bald eagle. The long eared animal on a cartoon commonly eating a carrot and saying \"What's up doc?\" refers to Bugs Bunny, who is a rabbit. The question is asking which animal would eat a rabbit, and the correct answer is the eagle. Options (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect because they do not match the description of the animal associated with America, and they are not typically depicted eating rabbits."

The long-eared animal on a cartoon commonly eating a carrot and saying \"What's up doc?\" is Bugs Bunny, a famous character from Looney Tunes. In this question, we can infer that the question is asking which animal would eat Bugs Bunny. Since eagles are carnivorous birds, it is reasonable to assume that they would eat small animals like rabbits. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Eagle.
