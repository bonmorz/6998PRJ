To answer this question, we need to have basic knowledge about the purpose of gloves. Gloves are commonly worn to protect the hands, specifically the skin, from various external factors such as cold weather, chemicals, or rough surfaces. They provide a physical barrier between the hand and the external environment, including the nerves in the hand. Therefore, gloves over hands protect the nerves from feeling sensations such as temperature, textures, or pain. Option (A) is incorrect because gloves do not protect the feet. Option (B) is metaphorical and not based on the physical function of gloves. Option (D) is incorrect because gloves do not directly protect the mind."
