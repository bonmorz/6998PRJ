A crack in the sidewalk with vegetation growing from it is an example of weathering. Weathering is the process by which rocks and surfaces are broken down or altered over time due to natural elements such as water, wind, temperature changes, and the growth of plants. In this case, the crack in the sidewalk allows for the growth of vegetation, which can further contribute to the breakdown and erosion of the sidewalk over time.
