Competition occurs when individuals of the same or different species compete for limited resources, such as food. In option (C), the shark and the orca are both competing for the same prey, the tuna. Option (A) describes a giraffe feeding on leaves, but it does not involve competition as it does not mention any other competing individuals. Option (B) describes a bear catching a salmon, but it does not mention any other competing individuals. Option (D) describes a slug eating a blade of grass, but again, it does not involve competition as it does not mention any other competing individuals. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer as it explicitly mentions competing individuals, the shark and the orca."
