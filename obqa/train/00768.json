When a storm moves over the Earth, it typically dumps more rain on areas with more vegetation, such as meadows.

Options (A) and (D) are incorrect because the Arctic and sandy areas typically receive less rainfall. Option (B) is incorrect because deserts are characterized by low vegetation and therefore receive less rainfall."

Storms are typically associated with the movement of air masses, which can carry moisture. When a storm moves over the earth, it will dump more rain on a meadow (option C) because meadows are typically flat, open areas with little obstruction to the movement of air. This allows the storm to unleash its full precipitation potential on the meadow. \n\nOption A, arctic, is incorrect because the arctic is a region characterized by extremely cold temperatures and little precipitation. Storms in the arctic are typically accompanied by snow rather than rain. \n\nOption B, desert, is also incorrect because deserts are characterized by low precipitation and a lack of vegetation. Storms in deserts are typically weak and do not produce a significant amount of rain. \n\nOption D, sandy area, is incorrect because sandy areas do not necessarily have the same characteristics as meadows. Sandy areas can vary in terms of vegetation and topography, which can affect how much rain is received during a storm."
