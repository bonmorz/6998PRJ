Option (C) states that using continuous motion on a device can get a person from point A to point B faster than walking. This is correct because it is referring to using a mode of transportation such as a bicycle, skateboard, or scooter, which allows for continuous motion and can cover greater distances in a shorter amount of time compared to walking. Option (A) is unrelated to transportation. Option (B) suggests a vague and unrealistic method of travel. Option (D) refers to accommodation and not methods of transportation."
