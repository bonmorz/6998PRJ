Bananas, pineapples, and coconuts are tropical fruits that typically grow in warm climates. Option (B) is incorrect because not all islands are warm and not all tropical fruits come from islands. Option (C) is incorrect because although tropical climates do tend to be wet, it is not a defining characteristic of the places where these fruits come from. Option (D) is incorrect because distance from a specific location is not related to the natural habitat of these fruits."
