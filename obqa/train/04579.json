Ligers are a hybrid cross between a male lion and a female tiger and are known to be the largest of all big cat species. However, ligers are often infertile and may have various health issues due to the genetic differences between lions and tigers.\n\nOption (B) states that ligers are less likely to thrive when there is famine. This answer is correct because ligers require an adequate and consistent food supply to meet their nutritional needs. When there is a scarcity of food due to famine, ligers may struggle to find enough prey to survive and continue to thrive.\n\nOn the other hand, options (A), (C), and (D) suggest favorable conditions for ligers. Massive antelope herds, abundant food, and readily available prey would provide ligers with a sufficient food supply and increase their chances of thriving. Thus, options (A), (C), and (D) would be beneficial for ligers rather than inhibiting their ability to thrive."
