When an object appears blue, it is because it reflects or scatters light with a shorter wavelength, which corresponds to the color blue.

Option (C) is incorrect because the sun emits light in a range of wavelengths, including visible light, but it is not specifically related to the color blue. Option (D) is correct because the sea reflects light in a way that makes it appear blue, as water molecules absorb longer wavelengths of light, such as red and orange, and scatter shorter blue wavelengths."
