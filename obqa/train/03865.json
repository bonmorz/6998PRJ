Nectar is a sweet liquid produced by flowers to attract pollinators, such as bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. These pollinators help transfer pollen from the male parts of the flower to the female parts, allowing for successful reproduction of plants. Option (B) is incorrect because while pollinators are indeed animals, the question is asking specifically about what nectar attracts. Option (C) is incorrect because nectar is not used to attract pollinators to the soil. Option (D) is incorrect because hives are structures that house bees, not the pollinators themselves."

Option (B) is incorrect because animals can refer to a wide range of organisms, not all of which are involved in pollination. Option (C) is incorrect because soil does not play a direct role in the attraction of pollinators. Option (D) is incorrect because hives are structures used by certain social insects like bees to live in, but they are not typically associated with the attraction of pollinators."
