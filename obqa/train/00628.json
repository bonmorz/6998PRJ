When polar icecaps melt, it leads to the loss of animal habitats, particularly for species that rely on ice for survival, such as polar bears and seals. Option (A) is incorrect because melting icecaps result in a rise in sea levels, which leads to a loss of landmass for states. Option (B) is not necessarily true because while some species may be able to adapt and roam different areas, many species will lose their habitats and may not be able to survive.
