This results in the lunar cycle, where the moon goes through a series of phases (new moon, first quarter, full moon, third quarter) roughly every 29.5 days. Therefore, option (D) is correct because the moon completes a full rotation around the Earth roughly once every 29.5 days. Option (A) is incorrect because the moon has never crashed into the Earth.
