Option (D) - campfire - is the correct answer because the condor's wing being singed implies that it came into contact with the flames of a campfire. Options (A) and (B) - ice and water - do not cause singeing. Option (C) - electricity - could potentially cause a burn, but the context of the question suggests that the condor was injured by fire."

In this case, the condor screamed in pain, indicating that it experienced physical harm. Option (A), ice, does not typically cause immediate pain to an animal. Option (B), water, is also unlikely to cause immediate pain unless it is extremely hot or boiling. Option (C), electricity, could potentially cause pain, but it is not mentioned in the context of the sentence. Therefore, the most likely answer is option (D), campfire. A campfire produces heat and flames that can cause burns and singe the condor's wing, resulting in pain."
