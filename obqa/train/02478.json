The question implies that a wet globe with an enormous mass is likely to have a stone layer. This can be inferred because a wet globe implies the presence of water, and an enormous mass implies a large size. It is logical to assume that a large, wet globe would have a layer of stone or rock beneath the surface. Option (B) is incorrect because the presence of a sun is unrelated to the characteristics of a wet globe. Option (C) is unrelated and not supported by the given information. Option (D) is also unrelated and not supported by the given information."
