Friction is the force that opposes the motion of two surfaces in contact. Rough surfaces have more irregularities or bumps, which create more surface area and therefore more friction. Smooth surfaces, on the other hand, have fewer irregularities and less surface area, resulting in less friction.\n\nIn this scenario, the unfinished wood is described as rough and unfinished, while the finished wood is described as smooth and polished. Based on our knowledge of friction, we can conclude that the rough wood will generate more heat than the smooth wood when rubbed over the floor. This is because the rough wood has more surface area and will create more friction, which generates heat.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the two pieces of wood will not create the same amount of friction. Option (C) is also incorrect because the rough wood will not move more easily when rubbed over the tile. In fact, it may experience more resistance due to the increased friction. Option (D) is incorrect because it suggests that the finished wood will generate more heat, which is contrary to our understanding that rough surfaces create more friction and therefore more heat."
