When a force acts on an object in the opposite direction that the object is moving, it causes the object's speed to decrease. \n\nOptions (A) and (C) are not relevant to the question as they describe unrelated scenarios. Option (B) states that a car is being pushed in the same direction that it is moving, so it would not cause the object's speed to decrease. \n\nOption (D) is the correct answer because it describes a situation where a car is driving north but strong winds are blowing south.

In option (D), the car is moving in a northern direction, but the strong winds are blowing in the opposite direction, which is southward. This opposing force of the wind acts against the car's forward motion and causes it to slow down. Option (A) is incorrect because the movement of bees flying north and a car driving west are unrelated to each other. Option (B) is incorrect because the person pushing the car in the same direction as its motion would actually increase its speed, not decrease it.
