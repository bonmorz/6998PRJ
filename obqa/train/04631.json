Heat can cause rock to expand and contract, which can lead to the weakening and breaking apart of the rock. Over time, this can lead to erosion, where pieces of the rock crumble away or are worn down by other forces such as wind or water. The other options are not as likely to occur as a result of prolonged heat. Shrinking (option A) is unlikely because heat generally causes objects to expand, not shrink. Breaking (option B) could occur if the rock experiences sudden and extreme heat, but prolonged heat would more likely lead to erosion. Melting (option D) would require extremely high temperatures that are not typically encountered in natural environments."
