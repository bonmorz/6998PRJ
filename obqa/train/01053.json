The expansion of the ice can cause the cracks to widen and eventually lead to the deterioration of the material. Option (A) is correct because it describes the constant need for road repair due to the expansion and contraction of ice. Options (B) and (C) are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the process of ice wedging. Option (D) is irrelevant because it only mentions the temperature of ice and does not explain the process of ice wedging."
