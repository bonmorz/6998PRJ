Mammals have internal fertilization, where the sperm and egg meet inside the female's reproductive system, and the fertilized egg implants itself in the womb for development. Chickens, falcons, and hawks are examples of birds, which lay eggs externally for reproduction. Thus, the answer is (C) lemurs."
