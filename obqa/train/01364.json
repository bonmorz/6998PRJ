Soil is made up of dirt, which contains a variety of microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. These microorganisms play important roles in the decomposition of organic matter and nutrient cycling in the soil. Option (B) is incorrect because microorganisms in the soil are not related to the air. Option (C) is incorrect because lava is molten rock and not relevant to soil composition. Option (D) is incorrect because although soil contains water, the microorganisms are specifically found in the dirt component of the soil."
