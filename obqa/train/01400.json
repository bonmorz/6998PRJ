The winner in a contest based on size and weight would be the object with more mass, as mass determines the gravitational force. Out of the given options, Earth has the most mass and weight, making it the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because while the moon is larger than a pebble or a cat, it has less mass and weight than Earth. Option (C) is incorrect because a pebble is small and has very little mass and weight. Option (D) is incorrect because while a cat may be heavier than a pebble, it still has significantly less mass and weight than Earth."
