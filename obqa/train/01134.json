Organism foods such as plants and animals contain nutrients that originated from the soil. Option (B) is incorrect because although the air contains some elements like carbon and oxygen, it is not a significant source of soil nutrients. Option (C) is incorrect because the barn is not a source of soil nutrients. Option (D) is incorrect because while water can transport nutrients through the soil, it is not a source of soil nutrients itself."

Option (C) is incorrect because while some organic matter in barns may contain nutrients, it is not a general location for soil nutrients.

Soil nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, exist in organic matter, which includes dead plants and animals.
