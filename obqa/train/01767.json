When vinegar (which is acidic) is mixed with baking soda (which is a base), a chemical reaction called neutralization occurs. This reaction produces carbon dioxide gas, which causes fizzing and bubbling. Option (C) is correct because carbonated cola contains carbon dioxide gas, which can cause a similar fizzing reaction. Option (A) is incorrect because adding air does not cause a chemical reaction with vinegar or baking soda. Option (B) is incorrect because bees do not have any relevance to the chemical reaction.
