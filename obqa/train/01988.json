When milk is placed in a chest with a device that removes warm air, the temperature inside the chest decreases. As a result, the milk will eventually solidify and become solid. Option (A) is incorrect because \"quaking\" is not a typical response of milk to changes in temperature. Option (B) is incorrect because \"searing\" refers to the process of cooking meat at high temperatures, which is not applicable to milk.
