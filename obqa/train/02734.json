When something is procreating, it means that it is mature enough or aged enough to reproduce. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) \"aged enough.\" Option (A) is incorrect because being under age implies immaturity and not being able to reproduce. Option (B) is also incorrect because being too old may imply infertility or a decreased ability to reproduce. Option (C) is incorrect because being young typically means that the individual or organism has not reached reproductive maturity yet."
