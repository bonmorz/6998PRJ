Gila monsters are a venomous lizard species found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They primarily live in desert and rocky habitats. Eagles are known predators of small lizards, so it is likely that a gila monster would have to interact negatively with eagles. Trees (option A) are not typically found in the desert habitats where gila monsters live, so they would not be a likely source of negative interaction. Snails (option C) and sharks (option D) are not typically found in the same habitat as gila monsters, so they are not likely sources of negative interaction. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) eagles."

Gila monsters are venomous lizards that typically live in arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.

Option (C) and option (D) can be eliminated. \nHowever, option (B) states that a gila monster will likely have to interact negatively with eagles. Eagles are known to prey on smaller animals, so it is possible for a gila monster to have a negative interaction with an eagle if the eagle attempts to hunt or attack the lizard.

Snails are not part of their diet or significant predators.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because gila monsters are not marine creatures and do not inhabit areas where sharks are present.\n\nOption (B) is the correct answer because eagles are known to be a natural predator of gila monsters. Eagles are capable of swooping down and grabbing a gila monster in their talons. This interaction would likely be negative for the gila monster as it would result in predation and potentially death."

Sharks are marine animals and not found in the desert habitats of gila monsters.\n\nOption (B) is the correct answer because gila monsters may interact negatively with eagles.
