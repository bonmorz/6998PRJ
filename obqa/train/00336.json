The intense brightness of the sun during an eclipse can cause permanent damage to the retinas of the eyes. Looking through a window or using hands to shield the eyes is not sufficient to protect them from the harmful rays of the sun during an eclipse. Taking a photograph may be a secondary consideration, but the most important thing is to prioritize eye safety."
