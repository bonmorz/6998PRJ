Pulling your finger over a guitar string is an example of making music with an instrument. When you pull your finger across a guitar string, it causes the string to vibrate and produce sound, allowing you to create music. Option (A) is incorrect because pulling your finger over a guitar string does not tighten the string. Option (B) is incorrect because you are not stopping a musical sound, but rather creating it. Option (D) is unrelated because it refers to putting a guitar away, which is not related to playing or creating music."
