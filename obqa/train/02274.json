When meat is submerged in lemon juice, the acidic nature of the juice can break down the proteins in the meat. This chemical reaction leads to a change in the composition of the meat, resulting in a tenderizing effect.\n\nOption (A) \"a piece of paper in marbles\" is an example of a physical change. The paper may become crumpled or wrinkled, but the chemical composition of the paper remains the same.\n\nOption (C) \"a blade of grass in sand\" is also an example of a physical change.
