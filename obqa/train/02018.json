This means that the water evaporates from the bodies of water, forms clouds through condensation, and then falls back to the Earth as precipitation, continuing the cycle. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer as it states that the water cycle repeats. Option (A) is incorrect because there is no explosion in the water cycle. Option (B) is incorrect because there is no new step after the last step. Option (D) is incorrect because the water cycle is a continuous process and does not end."
