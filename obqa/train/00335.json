Option (D) correctly states that a lighter object hue can allow for better reflection of light, which can lead to the ability to see yourself in it better. This is because lighter colors reflect more light than darker colors. Option (A) is incorrect because there is an effect of a lighter object hue.

Option (D), the ability to see yourself in it better, is the correct answer. When an object has a lighter hue or color, it tends to reflect more light. This increased reflection makes it easier to see oneself or objects in it, as compared to a darker-colored object. Option (A) is incorrect because there is a correct answer for this question.
