Option (D) is the correct answer because it is well-known that people can have bad reactions to medication or other products obtained from a pharmacy. Pharmacies distribute medications and other healthcare products, and sometimes individuals may experience adverse effects or allergies to certain medications. Option (A) is incorrect because bad reactions to items from a discount store are not as common or specific as reactions to medications from a pharmacy. Option (B) is incorrect because bad reactions to a lawyer would not be a common or expected occurrence. Option (C) is incorrect because bad reactions to items from a catalog are not as common or specific as reactions to medications from a pharmacy."
