Cold-blooded animals, also known as ectotherms, rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. They are unable to generate heat internally like warm-blooded animals (endotherms). Therefore, they thrive in hot climates where they can easily find warmth from the sun or other heat sources. Option (A) is unrelated to the topic of cold-blooded animals in hot areas. Option (B) is not a type of creature. Option (D) is a play on words and not related to the topic. So, the correct answer is option (C) - iguanas, as they are cold-blooded animals commonly found in hot areas."
