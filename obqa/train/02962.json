They are most likely to give a wide berth to a decomposing body. Deer have a keen sense of smell and can detect the scent of a decomposing body, which may signal danger or potential predators. Option (A) is incorrect because deer are often attracted to personal gardens and may cause damage to crops. Option (B) is incorrect because deer are herbivores and may be attracted to fields of alfalfa as a food source. Option (C) is incorrect because deer are often drawn to cool mountain streams for hydration and to access fresh water."

They will typically give a wide berth to anything that may pose a potential threat or danger. A decomposing body emits a strong odor that can attract scavengers and predators, so deer are likely to avoid coming too close to it. Options (A), (B), and (C) are all pleasant and natural environments that deer may not feel threatened by, so they are less likely to give those areas a wide berth. Only option (D) relates to a situation that deer would perceive as potentially dangerous or threatening, and therefore they would be more likely to avoid it."
