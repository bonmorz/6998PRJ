When we think about knobs, bricks, and panels, they are physical objects that cannot be endlessly retrieved. Once they are used or removed, they cannot be retrieved back in the same form. However, droplets are a resource that can continuously be retrieved. For example, in the context of water, when a droplet falls, it can be evaporated and then condensed again as a new droplet, creating a cycle where the droplet can be retrieved repeatedly. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer. Options (A), (B), and (C) do not possess the property of being endlessly retrieved."
