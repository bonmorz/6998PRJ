Cars driving over a stone road throughout a year, especially on hot days and cool nights, can cause the road to break up. The constant pressure and friction from the tires can lead to cracks in the road surface, which can eventually cause the road to break apart. Option (A) is incorrect because roads do not evaporate. Option (B) is incorrect because roads do not burn unless there is an external factor such as a fire. Option (C) is incorrect because roads do not flood, as they are designed to drain water properly."
