Predation occurs when one organism, the predator (in this case, the bird), captures and consumes another organism, the prey (in this case, the lizard). Option (A) is incorrect because symbiotic relationships involve mutually beneficial interactions between different species. Option (B) is incorrect because producers are organisms that can convert sunlight into energy through photosynthesis, and this does not apply to this example. Option (C) is incorrect because parasitic relationships involve one species benefiting at the expense of another species, usually by living inside or on the host organism and taking nutrients from it."
