The Grand Canyon is estimated to have taken millions of years to form through the erosion caused by the Colorado River. Option (A) is incorrect because a few days is not a sufficient amount of time for such a massive geological formation. Option (C) and (D) are incorrect because they do not relate to the formation of the Grand Canyon, but rather to the cost or time duration in a different context. Option (B) is the correct answer as it aligns with the scientific understanding of the formation of the Grand Canyon."
