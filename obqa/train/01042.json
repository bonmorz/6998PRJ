When a person wants to create things using raw materials, they would use materials that are readily available in their natural state. Option (A) is the correct answer because trees are a source of raw materials like wood, which can be used to make books. Option (B) is incorrect because rocks are not made out of wood. Option (C) is nonsensical because corn cannot be made out of dogs. Option (D) is illogical because fur cannot be made out of tablecloths."
