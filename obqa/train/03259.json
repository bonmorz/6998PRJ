If a zebra has more black than white on its body, it means it has more genes for black stripes. When this zebra has a calf, the calf has a higher probability of inheriting the black stripe genes.

Zebras have a pattern of black and white stripes on their bodies, and this pattern is determined by their genes. The genes for stripe color and pattern are passed down from parent to offspring. If a zebra has more black than white on its body, it means that it has more genes for black stripes. When this zebra has a calf, the calf will inherit its parent's genes. Therefore, the calf will also have more black than white on its body, leading to the answer choice (D) that it will be mostly black.
