Scrap yards often deal with large amounts of metal, and powerful magnets that use electricity can be used to separate and lift metal objects. This helps in sorting and processing scrap metal efficiently. Options (A) a grocery store, (B) a gymnasium, and (D) an office do not typically require the use of powerful magnets that use electricity in their day-to-day operations."
