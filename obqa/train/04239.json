When a flat rock is thrown at a low angle and with enough sideways spin, it can skip across the surface of the water multiple times before sinking. This skipping is possible because the flat shape of the rock allows it to interact with the water in a way that creates lift and reduces drag. The closest picnic leisure item that resembles this flat shape is a Frisbee, which is designed to have a curved edge that allows for a similar lift and reduced drag when thrown.
