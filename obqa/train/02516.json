Option (A) is the correct answer because as soon as a leaf is released from the tree, it no longer receives the nutrients and water it needs to survive, and therefore begins to die. Option (B) is incorrect because being eaten does not necessarily mean the beginning of death for a leaf, as it may be part of the natural process of being consumed for nutrients. Option (C) is also incorrect because a leaf is not born but rather grows and develops as part of the tree. Option (D) is incorrect because burning would be an external factor causing the death of a leaf, not the beginning of its natural death process."
