A newt is an example of an organism that experiences a complete metamorphosis, meaning it goes through distinct stages of development. It starts as an egg, hatches into a larva with gills, undergoes metamorphosis into a terrestrial juvenile, and eventually becomes an adult. Throughout these stages, the newt undergoes physical changes such as the development of limbs, loss of gills, and changes in body shape. Option (A) is incorrect because chickens, monkeys, and alligators do not undergo a complete metamorphosis like newts do."

To answer this question, we need some basic knowledge about different animal life cycles. A newt undergoes metamorphosis, where it starts as an aquatic larva, then develops into a terrestrial juvenile, and eventually becomes an adult. These physical changes can be observed throughout the life cycle of a newt. Option (A) is incorrect because chickens do not undergo dramatic physical changes like metamorphosis.
