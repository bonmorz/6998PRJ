Flooding occurs when there is an overflow of water that submerges land that is normally dry. This can happen due to heavy rainfall, melting snow, hurricanes, or tropical storms. Option (D), deluges, refers to heavy rainfall or downpours, which are one of the main causes of flooding. Options (A) and (B), dryness and droughts, are incorrect because they refer to periods of low or no rainfall, which would actually reduce the chances of flooding. Option (C), sunlight, is also incorrect because while sunlight is necessary for the water cycle and evaporation, it is not a direct cause of flooding."
