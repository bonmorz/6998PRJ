Dogs rely heavily on their sense of sight to navigate their surroundings and understand their environment. They use their vision to detect movements, identify objects, and interpret visual cues from their surroundings. Option (A) is incorrect because dogs cannot read. Option (C) is a basic ability that all dogs have, but it is not directly related to their sense of sight. Option (D) is incorrect because hearing is a different sense altogether and does not involve visual perception. Option (B) is the correct answer because it accurately reflects the dog's need to be able to visually sense something."
