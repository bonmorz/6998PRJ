Polar bears are adapted to live in cold environments and are typically found in the Arctic region, which is much closer to one of the Earth's poles than to the equator. Option (A) is incorrect because polar bears need a large, open habitat to roam and hunt. Option (B) is incorrect because polar bears are found in the Arctic, not in reefs in the ocean.
