Cellular respiration is a process in which cells take in oxygen and carbohydrates (such as glucose) and convert them into ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is a form of energy that can be used by the cell. This process allows cells to extract energy from glucose in a more efficient manner than just by simply \"burning\" it. Option (A) is incorrect because it is a subjective opinion and not related to the cellular process described. Option (C) is incorrect because breathing refers to the inhalation and exhalation of air, not the biochemical process happening within cells.
