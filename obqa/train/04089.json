When a vehicle is stalled, it is not in motion, and it requires an external force to get it moving again. This force can come from pushing or pulling the vehicle, or from using another vehicle to tow it.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because slopes alone won't move a stalled vehicle. They may help in providing momentum once the vehicle is already in motion, but they don't provide the initial force needed to overcome the stalling.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because wind is not a reliable or practical force for moving a stalled vehicle. Wind may exert some force on the vehicle, but it would not be significant enough to get it moving again.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because gravity alone won't move a stalled vehicle. Gravity can assist in helping a vehicle move downhill, but it doesn't provide the force required to overcome the stalling.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) force, as it accurately describes the external effort required to relocate a stalled vehicle."
