Carbonated beverages contain dissolved carbon dioxide gas, which forms carbonic acid when it reacts with water. This acid then dissociates into bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) and hydrogen ions (H+), giving the beverage its refreshing fizz. Option (A) is incorrect because steel is not dissolved in carbonated beverages. Option (B) is incorrect because plastids are structures found in plant cells and have no relevance to the composition of carbonated beverages. Option (C) is incorrect because plastic is not dissolved in carbonated beverages."
