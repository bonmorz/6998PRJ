According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the more matter a planet has, the stronger its gravitational pull. As a result, other bodies nearby are more likely to be dragged or pulled towards the planet. Option (A) is incorrect because \"triangling\" is not a term or action related to planetary interactions. Option (B) is incorrect because \"kissing\" is not a term or action related to planetary interactions. Option (C) is incorrect because \"punching\" is not a term or action related to planetary interactions. Only option (D) correctly describes the effect of a planet's mass on other bodies."
