A battery operated vehicle, such as an electric car, does not require petroleum. It is powered by electricity stored in a battery, which is used to run the vehicle. Option (A) is incorrect as battery operated vehicles do require electricity. Option (B) is also incorrect as ions are involved in the movement of electrons within the battery. Option (D) is also incorrect as battery operated vehicles need to be charged in order to replenish the energy in the battery."
