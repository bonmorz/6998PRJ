Human eggs, also known as ova, are least likely to be seen in the wild because human reproduction typically occurs internally, within the human body. Human eggs are released from the ovaries and then fertilized internally, so they are not visible in the wild. Bird eggs, fish eggs, and crocodile eggs are all commonly seen in the wild as part of the reproductive processes of these animals. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."
