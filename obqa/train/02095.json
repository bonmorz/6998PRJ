Option (A) is incorrect because an iris does not need to be dried and preserved. Option (C) is not necessary for the plant's survival. Option (D) may not be suitable as the plant does not need to be buried in snow. Option (B) is the correct answer as it refers to the fact that an iris needs a certain climate to grow and thrive."
