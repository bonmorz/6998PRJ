Penguins are primarily found in colder climates, with some species living in Antarctica. Black and white mammals could refer to a variety of animals, but a common example is zebras, which are found in grasslands or savannahs. Iguanas, on the other hand, are typically found in warmer climates, such as tropical regions. Therefore, a place where penguins exist with pods of black and white mammals would likely be colder and not suitable for iguanas to inhabit. Options (A), (B), and (D) do not provide any relevant information about the suitability of the location for iguanas, so they can be eliminated as well."

Penguins are native to cold climates and are often found in areas with ice and snow. Black and white mammals could refer to animals like orcas or zebras, which have similar coloration. These animals are typically found in different habitats than penguins, such as the ocean or grasslands. Iguanas, on the other hand, are reptiles that prefer warm climates and are not well-suited for cold environments. Therefore, the option (C) \"uninhabitable by iguanas\" is the most accurate choice, as it suggests a cold and inhospitable environment.
