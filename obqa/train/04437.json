This means that the composition and properties of the object change, resulting in different characteristics. Option (A) is incorrect because warmth is a sensation associated with temperature, but it is not a chemical attribute. Option (B) is incorrect because temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles, but it is not a chemical attribute. Option (C) is incorrect because appearance refers to the visual characteristics of an object, but it does not necessarily indicate a chemical change."
