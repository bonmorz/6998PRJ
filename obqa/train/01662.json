When the nervous system sends observations, it does so in the form of electrical signals to the person's flesh or body. These signals travel through neurons and are transmitted to various parts of the body, allowing for communication and coordination. Option (A) is incorrect because the nervous system does not send signals to cell towers. Option (C) is also incorrect because the nervous system does not send signals to computers. Option (D) is unrelated to the nervous system and plugs are not involved in the transmission of electrical signals in the body."
