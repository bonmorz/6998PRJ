Centipedes use shelter, such as cracks in rocks or burrows, to protect themselves from extreme weather conditions. Option (A), a planet, does not use shelter as it is a celestial body. Option (C), a rock, does not have the ability to seek shelter. Option (D), an ocean, is a body of water and does not use shelter either. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) a centipede."
