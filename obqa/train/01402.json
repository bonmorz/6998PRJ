Ecliptical longitude refers to the angular distance of a celestial body along the elliptical path of the sun. When the moon is in ecliptical longitude with the sun, it means that it is aligned with the sun and not visible in the sky. \n\nShortly after this alignment, as the moon starts moving away from the sun, a small sliver of the illuminated side becomes visible, which is known as a waxing crescent. Option (A) is incorrect because a waning crescent would be seen just before the moon aligns with the sun again. Option (C) is incorrect because a waning gibbous would be seen after a full moon. Option (D) is incorrect because a waxing gibbous would be seen after a first quarter moon."

                "content": "To answer this question, we need to understand the different phases of the moon and how they change over time. \n\nWhen the moon is in ecliptical longitude with the Sun, it means that the moon and the Sun are on the same line of longitude in the sky as observed from Earth. \n\nThe phases of the moon are caused by the relative positions of the Earth, moon, and Sun. A waxing crescent occurs when the moon is moving from new moon towards first quarter, and a waning crescent occurs when the moon is moving from last quarter towards new moon. \n\nSince the moon is in ecliptical longitude with the Sun, it means that the moon and Sun are close together in the sky. This is the position that occurs just after the new moon phase. \n\nDuring a new moon phase, the moon is not visible from Earth because the side that is reflecting sunlight is facing away from us. As the days pass, a small sliver of the illuminated side of the moon becomes visible, which is known as a waxing crescent. This is why the correct answer is (B) a waxing crescent. \n\nOption (A) a waning crescent is incorrect because the moon is not in the phase of waning crescent just after the moon is in ecliptical longitude with the Sun. Option (C) a waning gibbous and option (D) a waxing gibbous are also incorrect because these phases occur later in the lunar cycle, and the question asks about the phase shortly after the moon is in ecliptical longitude with the Sun."
