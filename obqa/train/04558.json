Option (A) is the correct answer because many bird species, reptiles, and some insects lay their eggs in nests found in forests. Option (B), space, is incorrect because eggs are not found in outer space. Option (C), lava, is incorrect because eggs cannot survive in extremely hot environments such as lava. Option (D), the ocean, is incorrect because although there are marine animals that lay eggs in the ocean, not all eggs are found there."
