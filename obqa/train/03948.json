Dragonflies are natural predators of mosquitoes, so the presence of many ponds and massive swarms of mosquitoes would provide a plentiful food source for the dragonflies. Therefore, they would experience a sharp increase in available resources. Option (A) is incorrect because dragonflies do not have the ability to convert an area into swampland. Option (C) is incorrect because the abundance of food would actually make the area a suitable habitat for dragonflies. Option (D) is incorrect because the available resources would support an increase in the dragonfly population, rather than a decrease."
