When sliding off concrete and onto gravel, the rough texture of gravel can cause chafing or friction against the skin, resulting in higher levels of discomfort or irritation. Option (A) is incorrect because gravel does not typically produce a shine like concrete. Option (B) is unrelated because value refers to worth or importance, which does not apply in this context.

When an object slides on a surface, the level of friction between the two surfaces affects the outcome. In this case, when sliding off concrete onto gravel, the gravel's rough texture increases the friction between the object and the surface. This increased friction leads to chafing, which is the answer in option (D). Option (A) is incorrect because sliding onto gravel does not typically result in increased shine. Option (B) is incorrect because value is not related to the friction between surfaces. Option (C) is incorrect because longevity is not affected by the friction between surfaces in this context."
