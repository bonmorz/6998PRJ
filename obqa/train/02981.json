When a spoon is placed outside under the sun (our closest star), it would feel warmer to touch. This is because the sun emits heat energy, and when the spoon absorbs this energy, its temperature increases, making it feel warmer to touch. Option (A) is incorrect because the spoon would not shrink due to the heat. Option (C) is incorrect because freezing over refers to the process of turning liquid into solid, which would not happen due to the sun's heat. Option (D) is incorrect because the spoon would not become a gas, as it would require much higher temperatures for that to occur."
