When an animal is more active, they will perspire and lose water through sweating, as well as panting to cool down. Therefore, to stay hydrated and maintain their water balance, they would need to take in more water. Option (A) is incorrect because increased activity leads to an increase in water loss, so the water level would not stay steady. Option (B) is incorrect because increased activity would require more water for hydration, not less. Option (D) is incorrect because increased activity leads to increased sweating and panting, not a decrease."
