Renewable resources are resources that are constantly replenished, such as solar energy, wind energy, or biomass. These resources can be used ad infinitum because they are continuously available. Option (A) is incorrect because renewable resources do not come from fossil fuels, which are non-renewable. Option (B) is incorrect because renewable resources are typically biodegradable and do not take centuries to decompose. Option (D) is incorrect because while it is important to use renewable resources conservatively to ensure their sustainability, they can still be used indefinitely."
