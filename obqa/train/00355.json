This increase in energy causes the temperature of the object to rise. The option (A) correctly states that absorbing sun rays raises the Fahrenheit of an object. Option (B) is incorrect because absorbing sun rays does not lower the Celsius of an object. Option (C) is also incorrect because absorbing sun rays does not cause the object to cool. Option (D) is not a scientifically accurate way to describe the temperature change that occurs when an object absorbs sun rays."
