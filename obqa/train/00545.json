Option (B) is the correct answer because pouring milk into a half cup is an example of measuring the amount of milk left. By comparing the initial volume of milk with the final volume in the half cup, we can collect data on how much milk has been consumed. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because pouring water into a gallon jug does not involve measuring, it is simply transferring water into a different container. Option (C) is also incorrect because assessing whether a blanket is warm enough does not involve measuring, it is a judgment based on personal preference. Option (D) is unrelated to the concept of measuring, as noticing how long a cat's tail is does not involve quantifying or determining the length."
