Some animals, such as mammals, have the ability to perspire or sweat in order to cool down in hot temperatures. Sweating helps to evaporate moisture from their skin, which helps to dissipate heat from their bodies. Option (A) is incorrect because running does not directly help animals regulate their body temperature in hot conditions. Option (B) is incorrect because hunting behavior is not directly related to adjusting to hot temperatures. Option (D) is incorrect because flying is not a behavior that helps animals specifically adjust to hot temperatures."
