By reusing plastic dishware instead of using disposable ones, we reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills or in the environment. \n\nOption (A) - using more Styrofoam - is incorrect because Styrofoam is non-biodegradable and can have harmful environmental effects. \n\nOption (B) - buying more stuff - is not a behavior that promotes environmental conservation. Buying more stuff often leads to more waste generation and resource consumption. \n\nOption (D) - burning more plastic - is also incorrect as burning plastic releases toxic gases and pollutants into the air, which can harm the environment and human health."
