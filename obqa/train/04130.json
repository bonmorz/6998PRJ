Since the dog is getting chubby, it suggests that it is gaining weight. Option (A) can be dismissed because sleepwalking would not directly result in weight gain. Option (B) may seem like a possibility at first, but it is not a logical conclusion because exercise alone does not always lead to weight loss or prevention of weight gain. Option (D) is also not a logical conclusion as the dog would not be gaining weight if it was refusing to eat.\n\nOption (C) is the most reasonable conclusion because overindulging in meals and snacks would result in an increased calorie intake, which can lead to weight gain in dogs. Therefore, John concluded that the dog was overindulging in meals and snacks, leading to its chubby appearance."

In this scenario, John noticed that his dog appeared to be getting chubby. By observing this change in his dog's physical appearance, John can deduce that the most likely explanation is that the dog is overindulging in meals and snacks, as mentioned in option (C). This is because excessive calorie intake without enough exercise can lead to weight gain in both humans and animals. Option (A) is incorrect because sleepwalking does not contribute to weight gain. Option (B) is also incorrect because if the dog were getting more exercise, it would be less likely to become chubby. Option (D) is contradicted by the observation that the dog's appearance is changing and getting chubbier."
