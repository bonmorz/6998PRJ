In winter, the amount of transpiration is generally lower compared to other seasons.

Option (A) is incorrect because in summer, when it is hot, plants tend to transpire more.

Transpiration is the process by which plants release water vapor through their leaves.

Option (A) is incorrect because transpiration rates are typically higher in summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased sunlight. Option (B) is incorrect because transpiration rates can vary depending on the specific conditions in fall. Option (D) is incorrect because transpiration rates can also vary in spring, depending on the specific conditions. In general, winter is the season with the lowest transpiration rates."

Transpiration is the process by which water is lost from the leaves of plants through small openings called stomata. The rate of transpiration is influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and sunlight.\n\nIn winter, transpiration is lower compared to the other seasons. This is because during winter, the air is colder and holds less moisture, which reduces the rate at which water evaporates from the leaves. Additionally, in winter, many plants enter a dormant phase where their growth and metabolic activities slow down. This further reduces the need for transpiration.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because in summer, the air is warmer and holds more moisture, creating favorable conditions for transpiration. Option (B) is incorrect because in fall, the air temperature and moisture levels can vary, but it is generally not as cold as winter, allowing for a higher rate of transpiration. Option (D) is incorrect because in spring, the weather starts to warm up, leading to increased transpiration as plants become more active in their growth and development."
