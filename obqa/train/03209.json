Option (A) is incorrect because \"feathered animal with a beak\" is a vague description and does not specify any specific group of organisms. Option (C) is incorrect because \"modern sport utility vehicle\" is not a living organism. Option (D) is incorrect because planets do not give birth to live young. Option (B) is the correct answer because \"a tail having tree dweller\" could refer to a group of animals known as marsupials, which give birth to live young."
