When an area floods, it means that it is filled with water from a nearby body of water, such as a river or an ocean. When comparing a place of lower elevation to a higher location, the lower elevation location is more affected by the flood.\n\nThis is because water naturally flows downhill, following the path of gravity. Therefore, when there is a flood, the water will naturally flow down to the lower elevation location, causing it to be more flooded compared to the higher location.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because lower elevation locations can indeed flood. Option (C) is incorrect because resistance to flooding is typically greater for higher places, as they are further from the body of water causing the flood. Option (D) is also incorrect because a lower area is not already flooded unless there is an ongoing flood event."
