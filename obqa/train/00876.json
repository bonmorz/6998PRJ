Acid rain is unhealthy because it contains various detrimental particles from the air, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which are released by burning fossil fuels. When these pollutants mix with rainwater, they form sulfuric acid and nitric acid, making the rain acidic. This acidity can cause harm to plants, animals, and humans. It can damage crops and forests, acidify lakes and rivers, and corrode buildings and statues. Additionally, when people are exposed to acid rain through inhalation or skin contact, it can irritate the respiratory system and cause respiratory illnesses. Option (A) is incorrect because drought is not directly caused by acid rain. Option (B) is unrelated as the evaporation rate of acid rain is not a factor in its health effects. Option (D) is incorrect because while acid rain can cause harm to aquatic ecosystems by lowering pH levels, it does not cause algae growth."
