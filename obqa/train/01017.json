Glasses are usually made of a thin and fragile material, such as glass or plastic, and are therefore the easiest thing to break compared to the other options. Notebooks and hardcover books are typically made with more durable materials and a stronger structure, so they are less likely to break easily. A wall is typically made of sturdy construction materials, such as bricks or concrete, and would be more difficult to break compared to glasses. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."

While tearing a page out of a notebook may be easy, breaking the entire notebook may require more effort.\nOption (C) suggests that a wall is the easiest thing to break. However, walls are typically made of sturdy materials such as concrete or bricks and are designed to be structurally stable. Breaking a wall would typically require significant force or specialized tools.\nOption (D) suggests that a hardcover book is the easiest thing to break. However, hardcover books are made to be durable and withstand regular use. Breaking a hardcover book would require intentionally exerting excessive force or damaging it in some way, which is not typical.\nOption (B) suggests that a pair of glasses is the easiest thing to break.
