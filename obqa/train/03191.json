When a person is making laps around a gym, their heart rate increases, causing their heart to start racing. This is a normal response to physical activity as the body works to supply oxygen and nutrients to the muscles. Option (A) is incorrect because laps around a gym have no connection to being born. Option (B) is incorrect because gaining weight is not a direct result of making laps around a gym, although regular exercise can contribute to weight management. Option (D) is incorrect because getting fatter is not a direct result of making laps around a gym, although exercise can help with weight loss and body composition."
