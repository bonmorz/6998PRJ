The only option that has more mass than the moon is your home planet, which could be Earth or any other planet you consider your home. Option (B), Skylab, was a space station that fell to Earth in 1979 and is therefore not relevant to the question. Option (C), the Atlantic ocean, is a large body of water and does not have more mass than the moon. Option (D), Pluto, is a dwarf planet that has significantly less mass than the moon."
