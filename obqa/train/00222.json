When a snail is heated to the point of being burned, it will experience discomfort. The burning sensation will cause the snail to retract into its shell or move away from the heat source in an attempt to protect itself. Option (B) is incorrect because being burned does not energize an organism. Option (C) is unrelated to the effects of being burned.
