Option (C) may provide some shade, but it would be more effective to plant taller trees. Option (D) is incorrect because smaller trees would not provide enough shade to cool the house."

This is because trees provide shade and can block sunlight from directly hitting your house. When trees have a significant height, they can provide more shade and help to lower the overall temperature around your house. \n\nOption B, planting ivy around the trees, may provide some shade, but it is not as effective as planting tall trees. Ivy tends to grow on the surface of trees and may not block sunlight as effectively as a fully grown tree with a large canopy.\n\nOption C, planting shrubs around the foundation, may have some impact on cooling the house, but it won't be as effective as planting tall trees. Shrubs tend to have a smaller size and may not provide enough shade to keep the house significantly cooler.\n\nOption D, planting trees that stay smaller than dogwoods, may not provide enough shade to keep the house cool. It is better to opt for taller trees with a larger canopy that can effectively block sunlight and provide ample shade for the house."
