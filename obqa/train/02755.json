When animals consume these fruits and then excrete the remains as waste, the seeds can be dispersed in different locations, allowing for the potential growth of new plants. Option (B) is the correct answer because poop (or feces) is a waste product that can contain undigested seeds. Option (A) is incorrect because sweat is a bodily fluid produced by sweat glands and does not contain seeds. Option (C) is incorrect because urine is a waste product produced by the kidneys and does not contain seeds. Option (D) is incorrect because blood is a specialized bodily fluid that transports nutrients and does not contain seeds."

Plant seeds are usually contained in the fruits or pods of plants, which are then dispersed through various methods such as being swallowed by an animal and then later excreted as waste. Option (B) is correct because poop is often a result of digestion and includes waste material, which could contain plant seeds. Option (A) is incorrect because sweat is produced by sweat glands in the skin and does not typically contain plant seeds. Option (C) is incorrect because urine is produced in the kidneys and contains waste products of metabolism, not plant seeds.
