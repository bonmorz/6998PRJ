Battery-powered vehicles, such as electric cars, use electricity stored in their batteries to run, resulting in zero emissions at the tailpipe. On the other hand, lawnmowers typically run on gasoline or diesel fuel and emit pollutants like carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Wind turbines and solar power are renewable energy sources that generate electricity without emissions, so they produce less emissions than lawnmowers. However, dragsters are high-performance vehicles that use specially formulated fuels, such as nitromethane, which produce high levels of emissions. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) dragsters, as they generate more emissions compared to battery-powered vehicles."
