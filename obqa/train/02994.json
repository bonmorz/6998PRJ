When the sun heats up the water on the ground, it causes the water molecules to gain energy and turn into water vapor. This water vapor then rises into the atmosphere and eventually cools down to form clouds. Once the clouds become saturated with water vapor, it can lead to precipitation in the form of rain or snow (options B and C). Freezing (option A) refers to the process of water turning into ice and is not directly related to water rising into the sky."

When the sun heats up the surface of the Earth, it causes water molecules to gain enough energy to change from a liquid state to a gas or vapor state. This process is called evaporation.

Option (A), freezing, is incorrect because freezing refers to the process of water changing from a liquid to a solid, not rising into the sky.
