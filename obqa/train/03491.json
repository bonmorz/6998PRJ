Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves and other aerial parts of plants. Option (A) is incorrect because fruit is not involved in transpiration. Option (B) is incorrect because seeds do not participate in transpiration either. Option (D) is incorrect because transpiration occurs in plants, not animals. Only option (C) mentions the flat appendages on organisms that give off oxygen, which is a clear reference to the leaves of plants. Therefore, (C) is the correct answer."
