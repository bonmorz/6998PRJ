Option (C) is the most appropriate answer because consuming bread, specifically complex carbohydrates, provides the body with a source of glucose, which is then broken down into energy. Options (A) and (B) are physical activities and would actually require more energy to perform, rather than provide energy. Option (D) may provide a temporary adrenaline boost, but it does not directly replenish energy stores in the body."

Option (D) suggests running again, which can be helpful for maintaining energy levels during a workout but does not directly provide energy after a workout.
