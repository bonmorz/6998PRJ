When a metal rod sits outside and absorbs a lot of energy from a star (most likely referring to the sun), it heats up and becomes hot. The correct answer is (C) sears. Option (A) is incorrect because crying is not a characteristic of a metal rod. Option (B) is incorrect because wiggling is not a reaction of a metal rod to absorbing energy.
