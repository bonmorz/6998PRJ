Prolonged solar exposure, or being exposed to the sun for a long period of time, provides the heat necessary for water to evaporate and result in a body of water drying up. Option (B) is incorrect because cooking lunch involves the application of heat, but it does not specifically refer to water turning into gas. Option (C) is unrelated to evaporation.
