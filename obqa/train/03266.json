A light drizzle (option A) does not involve any significant wind, so it is not the most windy. A light breeze (option B) may involve some gentle wind, but it is not considered strong or powerful. A powerful front (option C) may bring strong winds, but it does not specify a specific wind speed or intensity. On the other hand, a tremendous hurricane (option D) is known to have extremely high wind speeds, often exceeding 74 miles per hour.
