Fossil fuels are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals that have undergone millions of years of heat and pressure. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) ancient poo, as the organic matter of ancient organisms is a key component of fossil fuels. Options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because they do not represent the organic material necessary for the formation of fossil fuels. Buildings, cars, and silverware are man-made objects and do not contribute to the creation of fossil fuels."
