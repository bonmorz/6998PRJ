Bees are one of the main pollinators of flowers, and flowers will reproduce more if more bees visit them. Bees transfer pollen from the male part of the flower to the female part, allowing for fertilization and reproduction. Option (A) is incorrect because dragonflies are not pollinators of flowers. Option (B) is incorrect because if pollinators visit the flowers sparingly, there would be less opportunity for pollination and reproduction.
