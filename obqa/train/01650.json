Solar energy is derived from the sun and can be converted into electricity through the use of solar panels. \n\nOption (A), using solar energy to power a garden, is possible. Solar panels can be used to generate electricity that can be used to power garden equipment such as lights, pumps, or irrigation systems.\n\nOption (B), using solar energy to power a bike, is also possible. Solar-powered electric bikes exist and can be charged using solar panels.\n\nOption (D), using solar energy to power water pipes, is also possible. Solar panels can be used to generate electricity that can power pumps and systems used for transporting water through pipes.\n\nHowever, option (C), using solar energy to power a coffee grinder, is the most likely correct answer. Solar panels can generate electricity that can power small appliances such as coffee grinders. This can be useful in off-grid situations or for individuals who prefer to use sustainable and renewable energy sources."
