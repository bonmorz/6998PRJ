When the population of an organism decreases to the point that it is considered very likely it will soon reach zero, the organism is considered endangered.

Option (B) is incorrect because near-threatened refers to a species that is not currently threatened, but its population is declining and it may become threatened in the future.

Option (B) \"Near-threatened\" is incorrect because this classification is used when a species is not yet endangered but is likely to become so in the future. Option (C) \"Vulnerable\" is incorrect because this classification is used when a species has a higher risk of becoming endangered in the near future, but is not yet at a critical level."
