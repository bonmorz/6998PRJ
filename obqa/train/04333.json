If a bean is a mile away from where it originated and then develops into a plant that produces more beans, it is reasonable to conclude that the original bean must have been transported from its place of origin to the location where it is currently growing. Option (A) is incorrect because whether the bean was flat or not does not provide any information about its transportation. Option (B) is incorrect because beans are not built in the same sense as constructed objects. Option (C) is unrelated to the concept of transportation."
