Male peacocks have vibrant and elaborate feathers that are used to attract a mate. The attractive display of plumage is a key factor in the peacock's reproductive success. Option (A) is incorrect because sharks rely more on their senses (such as smell) and behaviors to reproduce. Option (B) is incorrect because horses rely more on physical strength and dominance to compete for mates. Option (C) is incorrect because spiders rely more on their ability to produce silk and construct webs to capture prey, rather than on their looks, for reproductive success."

The peacock is known for its elaborate and colorful feathers, which it uses to attract mates during courtship displays. This means that the peacock relies on its looks to attract a mate and reproduce. Options (A), (B), and (C) do not rely primarily on their looks for reproduction. Sharks reproduce through internal fertilization, with males using claspers to transfer sperm to females. Horses reproduce through a combination of visual and olfactory cues, with males and females exhibiting specific behaviors during mating. Spiders use various methods for reproduction, including elaborate courtship rituals and sometimes presenting prey to females as a form of nuptial gift. While looks can play a role in these species, it is not the primary factor for reproduction as it is for the peacock."

The peacock is known for its elaborate and colorful tail feathers, which are used to attract a mate during courtship displays. The peacock's appearance is directly linked to its reproductive success, as females are more likely to choose a mate based on the attractiveness of its plumage. Sharks rely more on their other senses like smell and electroreception to locate mates, horses use a combination of body language and physical fitness to attract mates, and spiders rely on their complex mating behaviors and silk production. However, the peacock's reliance on its looks for reproduction is the most pronounced and well-known among these options."

Option (A), the shark, does not rely on its looks for reproduction as they typically reproduce through internal fertilization. Option (B), the horse, does not rely solely on its looks for reproduction as they primarily reproduce through behaviors such as courtship and mating rituals. Option (C), the spider, may rely on its looks to some extent, but they primarily rely on other factors such as pheromones and vibrations to attract mates. Option (D), the peacock, is known for its elaborate and colorful plumage, which it displays to attract a mate during courtship rituals. Males with the most vibrant and attractive feathers tend to be more successful in attracting a mate, contributing to the peacock's reliance on its looks for reproductive success. Therefore, the correct answer is (D), the peacock."
