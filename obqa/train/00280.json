When the apple tree is chopped down, the birds lose their place to build nests. Option (A) is incorrect because apples can grow on other apple trees, not just the one that was chopped down. Option (B) is unrelated to the presence of the apple tree. Option (C) is incorrect because falling leaves can occur regardless of the presence of the tree.
