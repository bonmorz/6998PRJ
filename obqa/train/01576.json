To answer this question, we need some basic knowledge of planetary science and the criteria for classifying planets. \n\nScientists determine whether previously known planets are still considered planets based on whether they complete rotations. One of the criteria for classifying a celestial body as a planet is that it must orbit around a star and have enough mass to be in hydrostatic equilibrium (meaning it's nearly round). Additionally, a planet must have cleared its orbit of any other debris. If a celestial body meets these criteria and completes rotations, it is still considered a planet. \n\nOption (B) is incorrect because the presence of an atmosphere is not a criteria for classifying planets. Option (C) is incorrect because glowing alone wouldn't be a determining factor for whether a planet is still considered a planet. Option (D) is incorrect because the presence of life is not a criteria for classifying planets, although it is an interesting area of study."
