Sunlight provides energy for plants to grow, which deer consume as food. Additionally, sunlight helps maintain the deer's body temperature and plays a role in the synthesis of Vitamin D in their bodies. Option (B) is incorrect because while iron is a necessary mineral for deer, it is not the only item required for their survival. Option (C) is incorrect because sand does not provide any essential nutrients or resources for a deer's survival. Option (D) is incorrect because a cafeteria is a human construct and not a requirement for a deer's survival."
