In a quiet desert town, there is typically less artificial light and thus less light pollution. As a result, the night sky is darker and clearer, allowing for more stars to be visible. In a big city, there is more artificial light from buildings, cars, and streetlights, which creates light pollution and makes it more difficult to see stars. Option (A) is incorrect because the number of buildings does not directly affect the visibility of stars.

To answer this question, we need to think about the difference in light pollution between a quiet desert town and a big city. In a big city with lots of artificial light sources from buildings and streetlights, it can be difficult to see stars in the night sky. However, in a quiet desert town with less light pollution, there will be fewer artificial lights blocking the view of the stars. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) stars. Options (A), (B), and (C) are not related to the concept of light pollution and do not provide a logical comparison between a desert town and a big city."
