The changing from winter to spring is caused by the position of the Earth in relation to the Sun. Option (A) is incorrect because the moon does not influence the changing of seasons.

The change from winter to spring is primarily caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis relative to its orbit around the sun. This means that as the Earth orbits the sun, different parts of the Earth receive different amounts of sunlight. In the winter, the hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, resulting in less direct sunlight and colder temperatures. In the spring, the hemisphere starts to tilt towards the sun, resulting in more direct sunlight and warmer temperatures. Option (A) is incorrect because the moon does not have a direct effect on the change of seasons. Options (B) and (D) are incorrect because they refer to specific atmospheric phenomena, while the change from winter to spring is primarily caused by the Earth's position relative to the sun. Only option (C), which refers to a star, is unrelated to the change from winter to spring."
