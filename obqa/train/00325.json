When a magnet is placed near certain types of metal or magnetic materials, it will experience a force of attraction towards them. A grey stone, in this case, is likely to contain magnetic minerals, such as magnetite, that make it susceptible to being attracted to the magnet. Option (A) is incorrect because plastic is not typically magnetic. Option (B) is also incorrect because plaster is not magnetic. Option (D) is incorrect because paper is not magnetic."

A magnet typically attracts objects that are made of certain metals, such as iron. However, in this scenario, the student is surprised that the magnet tugs itself towards a grey stone (option C). This may seem counterintuitive because stones are not typically associated with magnetic properties. In this case, the grey stone might contain small amounts of iron minerals or other magnetic materials, which could explain why the magnet is attracted to it. Options (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect because plastic cups, plaster walls, and paper plates are not typically attracted to magnets as they do not contain magnetic materials."
