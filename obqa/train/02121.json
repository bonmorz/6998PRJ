This helps to maintain a stable temperature for the bees inside. \n\nOption (D), a statically charged shirt, is not related to insulation.

Wax has low thermal conductivity, meaning it doesn't readily transfer heat, making it a good insulator. By covering the beehive with wax, the honeycomb structure inside the hive is protected from external temperature fluctuations, helping to maintain a stable environment for the bees inside.
