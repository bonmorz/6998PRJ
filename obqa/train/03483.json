Blizzard conditions, characterized by heavy snowfall, strong winds, and poor visibility, are the most severe weather conditions and would make it extremely difficult for mail carriers to safely travel and deliver mail. Therefore, it is least likely for the mail to arrive during blizzard conditions.
