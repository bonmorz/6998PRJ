The correct answer is (D) the large object that illuminates a night sky, which refers to the moon. The moon is the celestial object closest to Earth and its reflected light is what illuminates the night sky. Option (A) is incorrect because Mercury is actually the planet closest to the Sun, followed by Venus. Option (B) is incorrect because Earth orbits the Sun, not another celestial object. Option (C) is incorrect because the third planet from the Sun is Earth itself."
