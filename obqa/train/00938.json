Option (A) is the correct answer because it provides an example that supports the statement. Thin tires are more likely to pop sooner than thick ones because they have less material to withstand external forces. Option (B) is unrelated because it discusses the health of dogs and does not relate to object resistance. Option (C) is incorrect because it suggests that thin pieces of wood are useful, which does not support the statement.

Thicker objects tend to have stronger resistance because they have more material to absorb and distribute the force.\n\nOption (A) is correct because thin tires tend to pop sooner than thick ones because there is less material to withstand the pressure and force exerted on the tires. Thicker tires can absorb and distribute the force, making them less likely to pop.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because it does not provide evidence of thicker objects having stronger resistance. It is unrelated to the concept being tested.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because thin pieces of wood may be useful for certain purposes, but it does not provide evidence of thicker objects having stronger resistance.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because thinness or thickness of a person's body does not determine how easily they bruise. Bruising is influenced by factors such as skin thickness, blood vessel fragility, and the force exerted on the body, not the thickness of the person."
