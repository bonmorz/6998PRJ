Plants eliminate waste through a process called transpiration, where they release excess water and gases through their leaves.

Bacteria play a crucial role in waste elimination through processes such as decomposition and the breakdown of organic matter. Robots, on the other hand, are machines and do not have biological systems for waste elimination. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer."
