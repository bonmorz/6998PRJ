                "content": "In order to find the answer to this question, we need to understand what sustainable, long-term energy means. Sustainable energy refers to the use of energy sources that can be replenished naturally over time and do not deplete finite resources or harm the environment. Long-term energy refers to sources that can provide a continuous and reliable supply of energy for an extended period.\n\nOption (A) fossil fuels are not considered sustainable because they are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals that took millions of years to become fossilized, and they are not easily replenished. Additionally, their combustion releases greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change.\n\nOption (B) windmills, also known as wind turbines, are considered a sustainable and long-term energy source. They generate electricity by harnessing the power of the wind, which is a renewable resource that will not be depleted as long as the earth's atmosphere exists. Wind energy is clean and does not produce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nOption (C) coal mining refers to the extraction of coal, which is a non-renewable fossil fuel. Like other fossil fuels, coal takes millions of years to be formed, and its combustion releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere.\n\nOption (D) fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a method used to extract natural gas and oil from deep underground. While natural gas can be considered a cleaner-burning fossil fuel compared to coal and oil, the process of fracking has significant environmental concerns. It can contaminate water sources, release methane (a potent greenhouse gas), and cause seismic activity.\n\nBased on this understanding, the correct answer is (B) windmills, as they rely on a renewable resource (wind) and generate clean electricity without depleting finite resources or causing significant harm to the environment."
