Doing chores involves performing tasks and activities that are necessary for maintaining cleanliness and organization in and around the house. Option (A) refers to instinctive behavior, which is behavior that is inherent and natural, rather than learned or acquired through external factors. Therefore, instinctive behavior is approximately opposite to doing chores because it involves natural behaviors that do not require learning or acquisition. Options (B), (C), and (D) are all examples of specific chores, so they are not opposite in acquisition to doing chores."

Doing chores involves acquiring the skill or behavior necessary to complete the tasks. Option (B) and (C) are both related to chores and acquiring the skills to perform specific tasks. Option (D) is also related to chores and acquiring the skill of washing dishes. However, option (A) stands out as the in opposite in acquisition because instinctive behavior refers to behaviors that are innate and do not require any form of learning or acquisition. Therefore, option (A) is the answer because it is approximately opposite in acquisition to doing chores."
