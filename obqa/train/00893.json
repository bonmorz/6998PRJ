Active physical effort, or engaging in regular exercise or physical activity, has a positive impact on body strength. When we engage in physical exercise, our muscles are challenged and stimulated to grow stronger. Option (A) is incorrect because frequent physical contact does not necessarily result in increased body strength. Option (B) is incorrect because irregular body motion does not provide consistent stimulation for muscle growth. Option (C) is incorrect because decreased physical effort leads to muscle atrophy and a decrease in strength."

When we engage in physical activities that require effort, such as exercise and strength training, our muscles are put under stress and they adapt by becoming stronger. Option (A) is incorrect because while physical contact can have benefits in terms of social bonding and emotional well-being, it does not directly impact body strength. Option (B) is incorrect because irregular body motion does not provide consistent and systematic stimulation for muscle growth and strength. Option (C) is incorrect because decreased physical effort would lead to deconditioning and a decrease in body strength."
