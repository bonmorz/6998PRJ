When trying to capture a clear photo of the moon, using a telescopic lens is the best option. A large magnifying glass (option A) may help to magnify the moon, but it would not necessarily result in a clear photo. A telephoto lens (option B) is a type of lens that is often used in wildlife and sports photography but may not be powerful enough for capturing clear photos of the moon. Looking through a microscope (option D) would not be practical or effective for capturing a photo of the moon, as microscopes are used for magnifying small objects."
