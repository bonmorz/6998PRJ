Renewable resources are resources that can be replenished or replaced in a relatively short period of time, usually within a human lifespan. Since renewable resources can be obtained without fear of using up, option (A) is the correct answer. Options (B), (C), and (D) are all incorrect because they imply that the resource is limited or will eventually be depleted, which is contrary to the definition of a renewable resource."
