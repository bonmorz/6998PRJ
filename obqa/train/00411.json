Option (A) is the correct answer because it demonstrates an example of increased demand (the soldiers eating beans) leading to increased production (beans being planted during war).

Option (C) is also incorrect because it does not show increased production in response to increased demand, it simply states that mice are afraid of cats because cats eat mice.
