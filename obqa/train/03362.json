During its life cycle, a frog starts as an egg and then hatches into a tadpole, which is considered the \"baby\" stage of a frog. At this stage, the tadpole has zero legs and uses its tail for swimming. As it undergoes metamorphosis, it develops legs. Therefore, if a frog is considered a baby, it would have zero legs.
