Option (A), craters on Earth's moon, is incorrect because the moon does not have an atmosphere or water, so it would not be suitable for a plant that requires lots of watering. Option (B), a sandy, barren desert, is also incorrect because deserts generally have very little water and would not provide the necessary conditions for a plant that requires lots of watering. Option (D), a large expanse of frozen tundra, is also incorrect because tundras are usually cold and have frozen soil, making it difficult for plants to access water. Therefore, the correct answer is option (C), a lush elm-filled area, because it implies a location with ample water supply, which would be suitable for a plant that requires lots of watering."
