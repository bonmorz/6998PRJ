When looking directly at an eclipse of the sun, it can cause harm to the organic light receptacle, which refers to the eyes. The intense light from the sun during an eclipse can damage the retina and potentially cause permanent vision loss. Option (A) is incorrect because trees are not affected by the direct view of an eclipse. Option (B) and (C) are also incorrect because clouds and rocks are not affected by the light from an eclipse."
