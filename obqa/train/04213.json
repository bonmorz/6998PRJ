Kool-Aid is a flavored drink mix that is typically mixed with water. However, mixing Kool-Aid with seawater would not be recommended because seawater contains a high concentration of salt, which would make the drink unpalatable. \n\nOption (A) is not necessarily something to avoid, as faucet water is typically safe to drink and can be used to mix Kool-Aid. Option (B), well water, can vary in quality depending on the source, but in general, it can be used to mix Kool-Aid if it is clean and safe to drink. Option (D), bottled water, is often a safe and convenient option for mixing Kool-Aid. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) seawater because it is not suitable for mixing Kool-Aid due to its high salt content."
