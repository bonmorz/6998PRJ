Option (C) is the correct answer because it describes the animal as being horned, warm-blooded, hungry, and alive. Horns are a feature of some animals, warm-blooded means the animal regulates its own body temperature, and being hungry and alive are general characteristics of living animals. Option (A) is incorrect because it describes the animal as dead, cold-blooded, and scaly. Cold-blooded and scaly are characteristics of reptiles, not furry creatures. Option (B) is incorrect because it describes the animal as cold, cold-blooded, hungry, and alive, but being cold-blooded contradicts being alive. Option (D) is incorrect because it describes the animal as warm, warm-blooded, and dead, but being dead contradicts being warm-blooded."
