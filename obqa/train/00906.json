Natural resources are materials or substances that occur naturally in the environment and can be utilized by humans. Option (B), briny waves (referring to saltwater waves), is a resource from nature as saltwater can be used for various purposes such as desalination or salt production. Option (A), Styrofoam plates, is incorrect as Styrofoam is a man-made material derived from petroleum. Option (C), window pane, is typically made from glass which is manufactured from sand, but the question is asking for a resource directly from nature. Option (D), nylon pantyhose, is made from synthetic fibers derived from petroleum, making it non-natural."
