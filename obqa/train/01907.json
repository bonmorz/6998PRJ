When a person plays a song on a string instrument, they create vibrations in the strings. These vibrations cause the strings to shudder, producing the sound. Option (A) is incorrect because molding is not related to the production of sound in a string instrument. Option (B) is incorrect because bawling refers to crying loudly and has no relation to the strings. Option (C) is incorrect because tearing implies damage to the strings, which is not what happens when playing a song on a string instrument."
