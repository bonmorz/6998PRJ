This can lead to habitat destruction, pollution, and changes in the balance of organisms in the ecosystem. Option (A) is incorrect because sunbathing is a human activity that does not impact the overall ecosystem. Option (B) is also incorrect because rock climbing, while an activity that may cause some localized disturbance, does not have a widespread impact on an entire ecosystem. Option (D), swimming, is unrelated to ecosystem change."
