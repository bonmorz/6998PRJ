The correct option is (A) because placing plastics in special containers indicates proper recycling. Plastics should be recycled rather than being thrown away or burned, as this helps reduce waste and conserve resources. Options (B), (C), and (D) are all incorrect because they involve improper disposal methods that harm the environment. Leaving plastic on the roadside contributes to litter, burning plastics releases harmful toxins into the air, and throwing away plastic containers instead of recycling them adds to landfill waste."

Option (A) \u2013 placing plastics in special containers \u2013 is the correct answer because it indicates that the person will properly dispose of plastic materials by recycling them. Recycling helps to conserve resources by reducing the need for raw materials and energy in the production of new products. \n\nOptions (B), (C), and (D) are all incorrect because they involve improper methods of disposal. Leaving plastic on the roadside (option B) would contribute to littering and environmental pollution. Burning plastics in their yard (option C) would release harmful chemicals and pollutants into the air. Throwing away plastic containers (option D) without proper recycling or disposal would also contribute to waste and pollution."
