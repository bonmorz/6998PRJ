When the sun comes up, it provides energy in the form of sunlight to the stump. This energy is used by the stump for various processes such as photosynthesis (if it is a plant) or other metabolic activities. Option (A) is incorrect because stumps do not \"blow up\" when the sun comes up. Option (B) is also incorrect because the size of the stump would not change simply due to the sun coming up. Option (C) is incorrect because stumps do not magically grow larger when the sun comes up."
