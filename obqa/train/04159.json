On a day without clouds, the sun is able to shine directly on the puddle, providing ample heat energy that increases the rate of evaporation. The lack of clouds also means that there is less humidity in the air, allowing the water molecules in the puddle to escape more easily. Option (A) is incorrect because on a snowy day, the temperature is likely to be colder and there may be less sunlight, slowing down the evaporation process. Option (C) is also incorrect because clouds can block sunlight and reduce the rate of evaporation. Option (D) is incorrect because a dark day would also have less sunlight, slowing down evaporation."

Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nOn a day without clouds (option B), there would be ample sunlight reaching the puddle, which would increase the rate of evaporation. The lack of clouds also means lower humidity levels, which further aids in faster evaporation. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nOn a cloudy day (option C), the sunlight reaching the puddle would be reduced, slowing down evaporation. Additionally, clouds are often associated with higher humidity levels, which can hinder the evaporation process. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nOn a dark day (option D), there is likely limited or no sunlight reaching the puddle, greatly reducing the evaporation rate. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nIn summary, option B (on a day without clouds) is the correct answer because it provides the most favorable conditions for rapid evaporation, resulting in the puddle getting smaller and disappearing faster."
