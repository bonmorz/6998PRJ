When plants are subjected to intense heat in an incinerator, they would undergo the process of cremation. Cremation refers to the complete burning and reduction of the plant material to ashes. Options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because these terms do not accurately describe what happens to plants in an incinerator. Petrify means to turn into stone, freeze refers to the process of solidifying at low temperatures, and wilt refers to the drooping and drying out of plants due to lack of water."

Option (B) is incorrect because freezing refers to the process of lowering the temperature, which is not applicable in an incinerator.
