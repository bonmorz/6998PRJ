Food competition occurs when different animals compete for the same resources, such as food. In this question, we are looking for a set of animals that do not compete for food.\n\nOption (A), dolphin and fish, is incorrect because dolphins and fish often compete for fish as a food source.\nOption (B), hyena and bear, is incorrect because hyenas and bears both compete for various food sources in their habitats.\nOption (D), eagle and raven, is incorrect because eagles and ravens often compete for carrion (dead animals) as a food source.\n\nOption (C), whale and cat, is the correct answer. Whales and cats do not compete for food as they have different habitats and diets. Whales are marine mammals and mostly feed on plankton and small fish, while cats are terrestrial animals and generally eat small mammals or birds.\n\nTherefore, the set of animals that do not compete for food is a whale and a cat (Option C)."

Dolphins and fish do compete for food in the same aquatic ecosystem. Dolphins are known to feed on various species of fish, so this option is incorrect.\n\nOption (B) states hyena and bear. Hyenas and bears occupy different habitats and have different dietary preferences. While hyenas are scavengers that primarily feed on carrion, bears are omnivores that consume a variety of foods including plants, small animals, and fish. Although they may occasionally encounter one another, they do not directly compete for the same food sources. Therefore, this option is possible.\n\nOption (C) states whale and cat. Whales are massive marine mammals that primarily feed on plankton, krill, and small fish. Cats, on the other hand, are land-dwelling carnivores that hunt small mammals, birds, and occasionally fish. Since their habitats and dietary preferences are completely different, they do not compete for the same food sources. Therefore, this option is possible.\n\nOption (D) states eagle and raven. Eagles and ravens are both birds of prey that often overlap in their habitats and diet preferences. They may compete for similar food sources, such as small mammals, carrion, and even fish. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (C) is the correct answer because whales and cats do not compete for food. They occupy different ecosystems and have different feeding strategies."
