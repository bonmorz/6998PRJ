Some animals, such as certain species of birds and mammals, shed their hair coverings in response to hot or scorching climates. By shedding their hair, they are able to regulate their body temperature more effectively. Option (A) is incorrect because naptime is not related to the shedding of hair coverings. Option (B) is incorrect because lunchtime is not a factor in the shedding of hair. Option (C) is incorrect because mating season does not necessarily affect an animal's decision to shed its hair."
