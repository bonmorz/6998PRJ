Wildfires can actually contribute to the creation of new material in the soil. When a wildfire burns vegetation, it breaks down organic matter and releases nutrients into the soil. This process, known as pyrolysis, converts organic matter into biochar, which is a stable form of carbon that can enrich the soil and improve its fertility. Option (A) is unrelated to soil formation. Option (B) is incorrect because magnetism does not directly contribute to the creation of new material in the soil. Option (D) is incorrect because free radicals are unstable molecules that can cause damage to living organisms and are not involved in soil formation."
