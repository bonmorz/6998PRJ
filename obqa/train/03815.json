Nonrenewable resources are resources that are finite and cannot be replaced once they are used up. \n\nOption (A) - Windmills: Windmills rely on wind energy to generate power. Wind energy is a renewable resource because wind is constantly replenished by natural processes. Therefore, windmills do not rely on nonrenewable resources.\n\nOption (B) - Dams: Dams are used to generate hydropower by capturing the energy from flowing or falling water. While dams can have environmental impacts, such as altering river ecosystems, they do not generally rely on nonrenewable resources. The energy source, water, is renewable as it is part of the natural water cycle.\n\nOption (C) - Solar panels: Solar panels generate electricity using sunlight. Sunlight is a renewable resource as it is constantly available. Therefore, solar panels do not rely on nonrenewable resources.\n\nOption (D) - Cell phones: Cell phones are electronic devices that require energy to function. This energy is typically supplied by batteries. Batteries, especially those used in older cell phone models, often rely on nonrenewable resources such as lithium-ion or nickel-cadmium. These resources need to be mined and are not easily replaced. Therefore, cell phones are the likeliest option to rely on nonrenewable resources.\n\nBased on the information provided, option (D) - cell phones are the likeliest to rely on nonrenewable resources."
