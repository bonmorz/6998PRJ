Fossil fuels, such as gasoline, are derived from ancient organic matter, which includes dinosaur remains. These resources were formed over millions of years and will eventually be depleted, hence the phrase \"someday cease existing.\" Option (B) is incorrect because water power, also known as hydroelectric power, relies on the flow of water and is considered a renewable energy source. Option (C) is also incorrect because solar power comes from the sun, which will continue to exist for billions of years. Option (D) is incorrect because electricity can be generated from a variety of sources, including renewable ones like solar power."
