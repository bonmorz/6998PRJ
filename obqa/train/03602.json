Natural gas, which is primarily composed of methane, is a combustible substance that can be used as a fuel. Option (D) is correct because natural gas can be ignited to produce heat, which can be used to warm the body or provide heat to a space. Option (A) is incorrect because natural gas cannot be used directly for bathing without additional equipment or processes. Option (B) is incorrect because ingesting natural gas can be extremely dangerous and potentially fatal. Option (C) is incorrect because freezing natural gas would not result in ice cubes, as it is a gas at normal temperatures and pressures."
