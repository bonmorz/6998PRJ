Tulips come in a variety of colors due to their genetic makeup. Different genetic combinations determine the pigments present in the petals, which ultimately give the flower its color. Option (A) is incorrect because plants do not experience emotions such as embarrassment. Option (B) is untrue because if the tulip were really yellow, it would not appear red. Option (C) is also incorrect because being sick does not change the genetic makeup of a plant and therefore would not cause a red color."
