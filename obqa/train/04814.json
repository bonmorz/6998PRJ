To safely eat meat, it is necessary to boost its temperature through cooking. Cooking meat at a high enough temperature kills bacteria and other pathogens that may be present, reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses. Option (B) is incorrect because raising its kids has no connection to food safety. Option (C) is unrelated and not a common practice in food preparation.
