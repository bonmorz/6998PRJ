When a negative and a positive charge are joined through a rare metal in a gas-filled globe, it produces incandescence. Incandescence refers to the emission of visible light as a result of high temperatures. Option (A) is incorrect because LED stands for light-emitting diode, which does not produce light through the same method. Option (B) is incorrect because High Pressure Sodium is a type of lighting technology, but it does not involve the specific process described in the question. Option (D) is incorrect because compact fluorescent bulbs use a different method of producing light, involving the excitation of phosphor coating by ultraviolet radiation."
