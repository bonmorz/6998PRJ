Soil is a natural resource that can be replenished and renewed over time through natural processes, such as the decomposition of organic matter. Therefore, it is considered a renewable resource.

In the case of soil, it is a renewable resource because it can be replenished through natural processes like organic matter decomposition, weathering, and geological processes. As long as proper farming practices are followed to maintain soil health, it will continue to be available for plant growth.\n\nOption (B) Abundant Resource refers to a resource that is plentiful or readily available in large quantities. While soil can be abundant depending on the region, this option does not specifically describe the nature of soil as a resource for growing plants.\n\nOption (C) Natural Resource refers to resources that occur naturally in the environment and are used by humans. Since soil is a naturally occurring material that is crucial for plant growth, it can be considered a natural resource.\n\nOption (D) Recycled Resource refers to resources that are reused or repurposed after their initial use. Soil is not typically recycled in the traditional sense, as it undergoes natural processes that replenish its nutrients and composition. So, this option is not applicable.\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, we can conclude that soil is an example of a renewable resource for growing plants."

In the case of soil, although it takes a long time for soil to form, it is considered a renewable resource because it can be replenished through natural processes such as decomposition and weathering.\n\nOption (B) abundant resource: An abundant resource refers to something that is plentiful or in large quantities. While soil may be abundant in some areas, this does not accurately describe soil as a whole.\n\nOption (C) natural resource: A natural resource refers to any material or substance that occurs naturally in the environment and is used by humans. Soil fits this description as it is a natural material that is essential for plant growth.\n\nOption (D) recycled resource: A recycled resource is something that has gone through a process of recycling or reusing. While compost can be made from organic materials, including decomposed plant matter and food waste, and used to improve soil quality, soil itself is not considered a recycled resource.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) renewable resource, as soil can be replenished over time through natural processes."
