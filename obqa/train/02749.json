A plant light is specifically designed to replicate sunlight and provide the necessary light wavelengths for photosynthesis in plants. Option (A) is incorrect because plants do not require comfort like humans or animals do. Option (C) is incorrect because protecting plants from bugs is usually done through other means such as pesticides or physical barriers.

Therefore, the purpose of a plant light is to provide plants with the necessary light energy they need for photosynthesis when natural sunlight is unavailable or insufficient.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because a plant light's purpose is not to comfort plants.
