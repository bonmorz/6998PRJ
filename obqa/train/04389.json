Organisms preserved in sedimentary rock, also known as fossils, are used as a source of fuel. Over millions of years, the remains of plants and animals in sedimentary rock undergo heat and pressure, transforming into fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. These fossil fuels are then used for energy and fuel purposes. Options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because organisms preserved in sedimentary rock are not used for clothing, water, or food."
