Sound waves are mechanical waves that require a medium, such as air or water, to travel through. In this case, the sound of a smack on a wooden board travels through the air, or specifically, the atmosphere. Option (A) is incorrect because sound does not solely travel through oxygen, but through any medium that can transmit the waves. Option (B) is too general and does not provide a specific explanation. Option (C) is true, as vibration is what generates sound waves, but it does not explain why the sound can be heard a mile away. Option (D) is the correct answer, as sound waves generated by the smack vibrate through the atmosphere, allowing it to be heard a mile away."
