Erosion is the process of wearing away or breaking down rocks, soil, or other materials on the Earth's surface. One of the main causes of erosion is the force of wind, referred to as gales in option (C). Wind can carry small particles, such as sand, which can then impact and wear away the surface of rocks or other materials. Option (A) is incorrect because salads do not cause erosion. Option (B) is incorrect because concrete is a human-made material and does not naturally cause erosion. Option (D) is incorrect because cars, likewise, do not naturally cause erosion."
