This process contributes to the components needed to sustain life in the soil. When organic materials decompose, they release nutrients into the soil, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are essential for plant growth. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because decomposition actually enhances the soil's ability to nourish plant life. As organic materials decompose, they release nutrients and organic matter into the soil, which improves its fertility and ability to support plant growth.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because decomposition does not increase the rate of nutrient depletion in the soil. It actually replenishes the nutrient content by releasing nutrients into the soil.\n\nOption (D) is also incorrect because decomposition does not decrease nutrients in the soil. It adds nutrients by breaking down organic materials into simpler forms that can be readily utilized by plants and other organisms."
