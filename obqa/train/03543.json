An unborn boy is more likely to be free of scars compared to the other options. Scars form as a result of injuries or wounds healing, and since an unborn boy has not been exposed to the types of activities or accidents that can cause scarring, they are less likely to have scars. Option (A) is incorrect because pro athletes are prone to injuries that can lead to scars. Option (B) is incorrect because active kids are also likely to experience injuries. Option (C) is incorrect because as people age, they accumulate scars from various injuries and surgeries throughout their lifetime."
