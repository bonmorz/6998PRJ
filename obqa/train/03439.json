The phases of the moon refer to the changing positions of the moon relative to the sun, which result in different portions of the moon's surface being illuminated.

However, this question specifically asks about the appearance of something else that is affected by the phases of the moon. Option (A) is incorrect because the phases of the moon do not affect the appearance of Mars. Option (C) is incorrect because the phases of the moon do not directly change the appearance of the Earth. Option (D) is incorrect because the phases of the moon have no effect on the appearance of the sun. The correct answer, option (B), is the astral night light, referring to how the phases of the moon change the amount and intensity of light it emits during the night."
