Ice wedging is a phenomenon that occurs in colder climates where water seeps into cracks in rocks or soil and freezes, causing the ice to expand and wedge the cracks apart. Over time, this process can lead to the formation of mountainsides with jagged edges and rock formations. Option (A) is incorrect because ice wedging does not create buildings.
