Plants require water (H2O) for various physiological processes such as photosynthesis, nutrient absorption, and transportation of water and nutrients. Option (A) is incorrect because while plants do release oxygen during photosynthesis, they primarily require carbon dioxide, not oxygen. Option (C) is incorrect because while iron (Fe) is a micronutrient required by plants, it is not a primary requirement like water. Option (D) is incorrect because while plants need sunlight for photosynthesis, clouds themselves are not a requirement for plant growth."

Plants require water (H2O) for photosynthesis, nutrient absorption, and transportation of nutrients within the plant. Option (A) is incorrect because plants produce oxygen through photosynthesis, but they do not require it for their own survival. Option (C) is incorrect because iron (Fe) is only required in small amounts by plants as a micronutrient.

Iron (Fe) (option C) is a micronutrient needed in small quantities by plants for proper growth and development, but it is not a primary requirement.

Water, on the other hand, is vital for plant survival and is involved in numerous physiological functions."
