Bears in the arctic can go a long time without eating because they have excess chub, or body fat, which serves as a source of energy during periods when food is scarce. Option (A) and (B) imply that the bear's mental state or determination affects its ability to go without eating, but this is not the case. Option (C) is incorrect because the bear's ability to go without eating is not related to its work or activity level."
