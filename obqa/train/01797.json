                "content": "To answer this question, we need to understand what pollination is and which creatures are involved in this process. Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the male part of a flower to the female part, which enables fertilization and the production of seeds. This process is crucial for the reproduction of flowering plants. Pollinating creatures, such as bees, butterflies, hummingbirds, and certain types of bats, are responsible for transferring the pollen between flowers.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because hyenas do not play a role in pollination. Hyenas are carnivores and do not interact with flowers. Option (B) is also incorrect because lions, as carnivores, are not involved in pollination either. Option (D) is incorrect because while rhinos may eat plants, they do not have a role in pollination.\n\nOption (C) is the correct answer because \"honey makers\" is a term commonly used to refer to bees, which are well-known pollinators. Bees collect nectar from flowers as a source of food, and in the process, they inadvertently carry pollen from one flower to another, facilitating pollination."
