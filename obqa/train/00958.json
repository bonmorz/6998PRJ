Option (D) is the correct answer because a Navy captain would often need to navigate at sea and a compass would be useful in determining direction. Option (A) is incorrect because Captain Planet is a fictional character and does not have practical navigation needs. Option (B) is unrelated because a compass is not typically used by captains of industry. Option (C) is irrelevant because a compass is not typically used in team sports."
