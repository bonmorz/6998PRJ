When a frog is born, it starts its life in the water and has tiny gills that allow it to breathe underwater. However, as it grows and develops into adulthood, it undergoes a process called metamorphosis, where it transitions from living in water to living on land. During this process, it develops lungs and loses its gills, allowing it to breathe air on land. Option (B) is incorrect because lungs are essential for breathing in adulthood. Option (C) and (D) are not related to the natural processes of a frog's life cycle."

Adult frogs have lungs and breathe air instead of extracting oxygen from water like tadpoles do.
