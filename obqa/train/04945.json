Dahlias are flowering plants and can live in specific habitats, such as gardens or fields. Rocks are non-living objects and cannot be considered as living organisms or part of a habitat. Lakes are bodies of water and can contain various organisms, but they are not living things themselves. Shoes are man-made objects and do not have the ability to live in a habitat. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) dahlias."
