Therefore, chuckwallas are able to survive with very limited water resources. \n\nOptions (A), (B), and (C) all live in aquatic environments and require water for survival. Fish live in water and obtain oxygen through their gills, so they need to be in constant contact with water. Frogs have semi-permeable skin and require moist environments to prevent dehydration. Whales are marine mammals that live in oceanic environments and are adapted to living in water. Therefore, option (D), chuckwallas, is the only one that needs sparse water. "
