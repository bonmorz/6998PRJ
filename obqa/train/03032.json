When a river is flowing down the east side of a hill, it means that the water is eroding the land on that side of the hill. This erosion causes the hill to drop sharply in that specific area. Option (A) is incorrect because if the hill dropped at a slow rate, the river would not have enough force to flow down the hill. Option (C) is incorrect because the river is eroding the land on the east side, not the west side. Option (D) is incorrect because the presence of a river indicates that there is a variation in slope."
