A road full of ice can result in slippery conditions, reduced traction, and increased braking distances, which can cause delays and make it difficult for a person to reach their destination on time. Option (A) is incorrect because a clear road path would facilitate smooth travel and potentially help a person reach their destination on time. Option (B) is also incorrect because a dry clear road means good driving conditions with no obstacles. Option (D) is incorrect because a road without hills does not necessarily affect travel time, as it depends on other factors such as traffic, speed limits, and distance."
