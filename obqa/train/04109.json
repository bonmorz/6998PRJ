Tides occur on a daily basis and are not typically associated with a long time period. Lightning occurs in a matter of seconds and is not typically associated with a long time period. Floods can occur in a short time period but can also occur over a longer time period depending on the type of flood. However, rock breaking is a process that occurs over many years due to weathering and erosion. Rocks can break down slowly over time through various processes such as freeze-thaw cycles, exposure to wind and water, and chemical weathering. Thus, option (C) is the correct answer."
