The Earth rotates on its axis, causing different parts of the Earth to face the sun at different times. As the Earth rotates, different countries experience daylight and darkness. This is the reason why at any given time, some countries may be in bed experiencing nighttime, while others are in the middle of the day enjoying the outdoors. Option (A) is incorrect because ocean tides are caused by gravitational forces from the moon and sun, not rotation. Option (B) is unrelated to the rotation of the Earth. Option (D) is close but not the correct answer. While the rotation of the sun does happen, it does not explain why different countries experience different times of day simultaneously. The rotation of the sun is what causes day and night, but it is the rotation of the Earth that leads to different time zones."
