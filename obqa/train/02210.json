We know that on Earth, over 70% of the surface is covered by water in the form of oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers. Therefore, if a planet is wet, it is likely to have more bodies of water than land. Option (B) correctly states that the number of seas will outnumber the amount of land. Option (A) is incorrect because it suggests that land will be dominant over water. Option (C) is incorrect because it suggests that the amount of land will be greater than the amount of water. Option (D) is incorrect because it suggests that the size of seas will be smaller than land, but this is not necessarily true."
