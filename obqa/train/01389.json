As the river rushes, the water exerts force on the pebbles, causing them to rub against one another and become smoother over time. Option (A) is incorrect because the pebbles being wet is not directly related to the rushing of the river. Option (B) is incorrect because the clarity of the pebbles is not mentioned or relevant to the question. Option (C) is incorrect because the pebbles become smoother, not rougher, as a result of the rushing water. Option (D) is the correct answer because the pebbles become velvety or smooth due to the constant rubbing and erosion caused by the rushing river."
