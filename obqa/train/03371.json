Acid rain, which is rain that has a lower pH due to pollution, can cause damage to surfaces including cars. Over time, acid rain can corrode the paintwork on a car, causing the color to fade or change. Option (A) is incorrect because acid rain would not directly affect an indoor pizza. Option (B) is incorrect because acid rain would not directly affect an indoor TV. Option (C) is also incorrect because acid rain would not directly affect the inside of a house unless there are leaks or open windows allowing the rain to enter."
