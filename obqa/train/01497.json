Erosion refers to the process of wearing away and removing rock, soil, and sediment from the land. When a river is eroded, the force of the water flow and the movement of sediment can cause the riverbed and banks to be enlarged and deepened over time. This results in a larger river compared to its original size. Options (B), (C), and (D) are not related to the effects of erosion on a river."

Erosion refers to the process of wearing away or breaking down of rocks and sediment by forces like water, wind, or ice. In the case of a river, erosion can occur when the flowing water picks up and carries sediment, gradually wearing away the riverbed and its banks. This process can enlarge or widen the river over time, resulting in the river channel becoming broader and deeper. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. Option (B) is incorrect because erosion does not directly cause warming of the river. Option (C) is incorrect because erosion does not necessarily increase the height of the river. Option (D) is incorrect because erosion generally results in the opposite - a river becoming larger rather than shrinking."

Erosion involves the wearing away of soil, rock, or sediment by natural processes such as water, wind, or ice. When erosion occurs along a river, it can cause the river to enlarge or widen over time. This is because the eroded material is carried away by the force of the water, causing the riverbed and banks to change shape and size. Options (B), (C), and (D) are all incorrect because warming, heightening, and shrinking are not direct effects of erosion on a river."
