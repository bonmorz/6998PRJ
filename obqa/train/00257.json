Option (A) popcorn is not a natural food for hawks and does not provide the necessary nutrients. Option (B) grass is the diet of herbivores and not suitable for a hawk. Option (C) an apple is a fruit and not a food that hawks would typically eat. Option (D) a bison is a large mammal and would be a suitable prey item for a hawk.
