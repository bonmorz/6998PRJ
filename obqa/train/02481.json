Wolves primarily rely on their snouts to track and locate prey, so losing their snout would make it extremely difficult for them to satisfy their hunger. Option (A) is incorrect because losing their tail would not significantly impact their ability to hunt or feed. Options (B) and (C) are also incorrect because eyebrows and eyelashes are not essential in capturing and eating prey."

The snout of a wolf is responsible for several important functions related to hunting and feeding. It contains the nose, which is the primary sense organ used for detecting prey and tracking scents. Additionally, the snout contains the mouth and teeth, which are necessary for capturing and consuming prey.\n\nOption (A), tail, is not related to a wolf's ability to satisfy hunger as it is mainly used for communication and balance. Option (B), eyebrow, also does not play a significant role in hunting or feeding, as wolves primarily rely on their acute hearing and scent detection rather than vision. Option (C), eyelash, serves to protect the eyes from debris and does not directly impact a wolf's ability to satisfy hunger.\n\nTherefore, losing the snout would significantly impair a wolf's ability to hunt and consume prey, making it hard for them to satisfy hunger. Thus, the correct answer is (D) snout."
