Thunder and lightning are often associated with the presence of a thunderstorm, which typically brings rain. Therefore, it is likely that if there is thunder and lightning, there is a great chance of rain. Option (A) is incorrect because thunder and lightning do not necessarily indicate the presence of acid rain. Option (B) is partially correct, as wind can sometimes indicate a chance of rain, but it is not as specific as the thunder and lightning option. Option (C) is incorrect because fire is not typically associated with rain."

Thunder and lightning are created by the rapid expansion and contraction of air during a thunderstorm, which is often accompanied by rainfall. Option (A) is incorrect because thunder and lightning do not necessarily indicate that there will be acid rain. Acid rain is caused by pollutants in the air, not by thunderstorms. Option (B) is partially true as wind can indicate a chance of rain, but it does not guarantee rainfall. Option (C) is untrue as fire can actually reduce the chances of rain, especially if it is burning vegetation."
