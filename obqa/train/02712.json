A bush fire can break out without human action if there are certain weather conditions that make the environment more susceptible to fire. Option (A) suggests that the mercury read high on the thermometer that day, indicating that it was hot. High temperatures increase the risk of fires as it dries out the vegetation and increases the potential for ignition. Option (B) is incorrect because a cloudy day does not necessarily contribute to the occurrence of bush fires. Option (C) is incorrect because a very rainy day would make it less likely for a fire to break out. Moisture from rain helps to dampen the vegetation and reduces the risk of fire. Option (D) is incorrect because a very cold day would also make it less likely for a fire to break out. Fire requires heat to start and spread, so cold temperatures would inhibit fire activity."
