Electrical insulation is a protective layer or material that prevents electric current from flowing between conductors or components. Ethernet cables are examples of materials used for electrical insulation because they have an outer sheath made of non-conductive material that prevents current leakage. Option (B) is incorrect because stove burners are conductive and not used for insulation. Option (C) is incorrect because movie cameras do not typically have insulation properties. Option (D) is incorrect because air conditioning systems do not serve as insulation."
