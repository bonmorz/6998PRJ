Option (A) is the correct answer because it demonstrates the behavior of kittens grooming their faces, which they learned by watching their mother lick their faces. This behavior is a result of observational learning. Option (B) is incorrect because dogs barking is not solely taught by their parents, but can also be a natural instinct and a means of communication. Option (C) is incorrect because babies crying is a result of various factors and is not solely learned from watching overtired parents cry. Option (D) is incorrect because kittens climbing trees is not specifically learned behavior from watching squirrels, but can be a natural instinct for cats to explore their environment."
