When a gas is vaporized from a surface liquid under increased pressure and higher temperatures, it is in a stage where water molecules are prevented from escaping into the atmosphere. Option (B) correctly describes this stage. Option (A) is incorrect because it refers to the overall process of water cycle, not specifically to the state of the gas.

When a liquid is vaporized from a surface, it means that the liquid is converting into gas form. Under increased pressure and higher temperatures, the gas molecules have more energy and are more likely to escape into the atmosphere. Option (B) is incorrect because it suggests that the water molecules are prevented from escaping, which is not the case during evaporation. Option (C) is incorrect because evaporation is a stage when moisture leaves the surface and enters the atmosphere, not the other way around. Option (D) is incorrect because evaporation can occur multiple times as long as there is a source of liquid and conditions for vaporization. Option (A) correctly explains that evaporation is part of the natural cycle of water, where water replenishes, purifies, and recirculates in nature."
