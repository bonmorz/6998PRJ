While all of the options listed require water to some extent, a lake would rely on rainfall the most to sustain life. \n\nA water feature, such as a fountain or waterfall, does not have a continuous water source and relies on artificial means to supply water. Therefore, it would not be as dependent on rainfall.\n\nA pool is a man-made structure that typically uses treated or chlorinated water. It does not rely on rainfall for its water supply, as it is usually filled and maintained by a combination of tap water and chemicals.\n\nA water park, similar to a pool, typically uses treated water that is continuously circulated and filtered. It is not dependent on rainfall for its water supply.\n\nHowever, a lake is a naturally occurring body of water that relies on rainfall or other water sources like rivers and streams to replenish its water levels. The health and sustainability of a lake's ecosystem and the organisms that rely on it are deeply tied to the availability of rainfall. In times of drought or limited rainfall, a lake can experience lowered water levels and potentially harmful effects on the organisms living within it.\n\nTherefore, the option that would rely on rainfall the most to sustain life is a lake."

Therefore, rainfall is not the primary source of sustenance for a water feature, making option (A) incorrect.\n\nA pool is a contained body of water that is typically treated with chemicals to maintain cleanliness and hygiene. While some pool water may be replenished with rainfall, it primarily relies on other water sources, such as municipal water supplies or well water, to sustain its levels. Therefore, rainfall is not the primary source of sustenance for a pool, making option (B) incorrect.\n\nA water park is a larger recreational facility that includes various water attractions like slides, wave pools, and lazy rivers. Similar to pools, water parks often rely on other water sources, such as municipal supplies, to maintain their operations. While rainfall may contribute to some water replenishment, it is not the primary source. Therefore, rainfall is not the primary source of sustenance for a water park, making option (C) incorrect.\n\nOn the other hand, a lake is a natural or artificially created body of water that receives water primarily from rainfall and other natural sources like rivers or streams. Lakes rely heavily on rainfall to sustain their water levels and provide habitats for various plant and animal species. Option (D) is the correct answer as it correctly identifies that a lake would rely on rainfall the most to sustain life."
