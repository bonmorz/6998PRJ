Based on common sense and basic knowledge of safety precautions, the person would want to have some protection. Option (A) of wanting zero protection is incorrect because it would be unsafe and risky to proceed without any form of protection. Option (C) of wanting naked skin is also incorrect because exposing the skin could potentially lead to harm or injury. Option (D) of wanting bare hands is similar to option (C) and would also not provide adequate protection. \n\nOption (B) of wanting safety goggles is the correct answer because wearing safety goggles would provide protection for the eyes in case of any unexpected reactions or splatters. Safety goggles are a common safety precaution in situations where there is a risk of projectiles, chemicals, or other materials coming into contact with the eyes. Choosing option (B) ensures that the person takes a necessary safety measure to minimize the risk of injury or harm."
