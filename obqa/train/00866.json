Two females, without the involvement of a male, cannot generally produce offspring. Option (A) is incorrect because while females can give birth to children, it requires the involvement of a male.

Option (C) is incorrect because offspring usually refers to the collective term for children, but again, it requires reproduction that involves a male.
