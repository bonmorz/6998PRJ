Option (C) is correct because leaving behind refuse on public beaches, such as litter or trash, contributes to pollution. This pollution can harm wildlife, disrupt ecosystems, and have negative effects on the environment. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because purchasing products made from recycled materials actually helps to reduce pollution. It reduces the demand for new resources and decreases the amount of waste that ends up in landfills.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect because switching to energy-efficient appliances helps to reduce pollution. These appliances use less energy, which leads to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because recycling paper and plastic also helps to reduce pollution. By recycling these materials, we can save energy, conserve resources, and reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills.\n\nOverall, option (C) is the correct answer because leaving refuse on public beaches is a form of pollution that humans contribute to."
