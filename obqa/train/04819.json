This makes sense because if the notebooks are made from paper, then a large number of notebooks being created would require a significant amount of paper. This could lead to deforestation and habitat loss as trees are cut down to produce the paper. \n\nOption (A) stating longer days is unrelated to the creation of notebooks and is not a logical consequence. Option (C) stating lush landscapes is also unrelated because there is no direct correlation between creating notebooks and the appearance of landscapes. Option (D) stating shorter days is also unrelated and does not make logical sense in the context of creating notebooks."
