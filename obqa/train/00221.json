Adaptation refers to the process by which an organism adjusts to its environment to increase its chances of survival. Option (B), wearing sunblock, is an example of adaptation because it is a behavior or action taken to protect oneself from the harmful effects of the sun, which is an environmental factor. Options (A), (C), and (D) are unrelated to adaptation."

Adaptation refers to a characteristic or behavior that helps an organism survive and thrive in its environment. Of the options given, wearing sunblock is the only example that demonstrates adaptation. This is because wearing sunblock helps protect the skin from the harmful effects of sunlight, such as ultraviolet radiation, which can cause sunburn, skin damage, and an increased risk of skin cancer. Eating tacos, reading a book, and drinking water are not examples of adaptations because they do not directly relate to an organism's ability to survive in its environment."
