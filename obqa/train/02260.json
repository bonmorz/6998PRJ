Option (D) is the correct answer because fears and phobias are often learned through past experiences or exposure to traumatic events. If the person has a serious fear of dogs, it is likely that they have had a negative experience or have been taught to fear dogs in their past. Option (A) is not a specific cause and could apply to any fear. Option (B) suggests that the fear is genetic, which is unlikely for a fear of dogs. Option (C) suggests that the fear is uncommon, which is not necessarily the case as many people have fears of certain animals."

A fear of dogs is most likely learned through a negative experience or by observing others. Option (A) is incorrect because being scared is a response to fear, not the cause of the fear itself. Option (B) is possible, as fears can sometimes be inherited, but there is no information given in the question to suggest this. Option (C) is unrelated, as the question is asking about the origin of the fear, not the frequency of it. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the fear was learned."

Option (A), being scared, does not explain why the fear exists in the first place. Option (B), inherited, suggests that the fear is genetic, but there is no evidence or context provided to support this. Option (C), rare, does not provide any explanation for the fear. Option (D), learned, is the most plausible explanation. Fear of dogs is often a learned response, typically as a result of a negative experience or trauma. Therefore, it is likely that the person's fear of dogs is learned and not inherited or rare. As a solution to overcome this fear, they should spend time getting better acquainted with dogs, which can help reduce the fear through exposure therapy and positive experiences."
