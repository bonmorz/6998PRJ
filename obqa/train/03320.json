Chloroplasts in shrubs absorb carbon dioxide from the air and, through the process of photosynthesis, convert it into glucose and oxygen. The oxygen is released into the air, making it breathable for humans and other animals. Option (B) is unrelated to the process of photosynthesis. Option (C) is incorrect because sweat is produced by sweat glands in the skin and is not related to the absorption of carbon dioxide by chloroplasts. Option (D) is incorrect because water is not produced as a direct result of photosynthesis, although water is important for the process to occur."
