Basic knowledge about the corrosive effects of cola can help determine the correct answer. Cola is known to contain acid, particularly phosphoric acid, which can erode or remove layers from the surface of objects. Option (A) is correct because enamel on molars is made of similar materials as the surface of objects that can be corroded by cola. Option (B) is incorrect because spoons are usually made of stainless steel, which is not easily corroded by cola. Option (C) is incorrect because porcelain is a strong and non-corrosive material that would not be affected by cola. Option (D) is also incorrect because the coffee pot is usually made of materials such as glass or stainless steel, which are not easily corroded by cola."
