When a violin is played, the strings are plucked or bowed, causing them to vibrate. These vibrations create sound waves that travel through the air and reach our ears, allowing us to hear the music. Option (A) is incorrect because playing a violin does not create a new word. Option (C) is unrelated to creating sound with a violin. Option (D) is unrelated to playing a violin and is a bodily response to physical exertion. Option (B) is the correct answer as it refers to the vibrations that occur when the strings are played, similar to the vibrations caused by an earthquake."
