Option (D) is the correct answer as it accurately describes what speed measures. Option (A) is incorrect because speed does not measure how fast an object is melting. Option (B) is also incorrect because speed does not measure how fast an object is evaporating. Option (C) is incorrect because speed does not measure how fast an object is rotating."
