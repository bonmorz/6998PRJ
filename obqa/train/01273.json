Plants have a system of tubes called xylem and phloem that transport water and nutrients from the roots to the other parts of the plant. Option (A) is the correct answer because lilies are plants and have this system of tubes. Options (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because they are not living organisms and do not have a system for transporting water and nutrients."
