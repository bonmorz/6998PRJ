Metamorphosis refers to the process of transformation or development from one form to another in an organism's life cycle. In most cases, metamorphosis is not complete until adulthood. The larva stage (option D) is an early stage in the process, followed by pupa or chrysalis, and then adulthood. Option B, embryo, refers to the earliest stage of development and is not specific to metamorphosis. Option C, hatching egg, refers to the hatching of an embryo and is also not specific to metamorphosis. Therefore, option A, adulthood, is the correct answer."

Option (B) embryo is incorrect because it is the stage before the larval stage. Option (C) hatching egg is incorrect because it is the beginning of the larval stage.
