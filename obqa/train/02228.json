When a person yells inside a garage or any enclosed space, the sound waves bounce off the walls and objects in the space and then return to the person's ears. This creates a repetition of the sound, commonly known as an echo. However, since the sound waves lose energy as they bounce around, the echo is usually softer than the original shout. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer. Option (A) is unrelated to the situation and is meant to distract. Option (B) is also unrelated and meant to distract. Option (C) is also unrelated, as the revving of a car engine is not typically associated with an echo."
