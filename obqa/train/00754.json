They attach themselves to larger marine animals, such as sharks or whales, using a specialized suction cup on the top of their head. They then scavenge food scraps and parasites from their host animal. This strategy allows them to obtain their food without actively hunting, catching, or stealing. Option (A) is incorrect because Remora do not actively catch prey. Option (C) is incorrect because they do not actively hunt for food. Option (D) is incorrect because stealing implies taking food from another individual, which is not how Remora obtain their food."
