The tidal range, which is the difference between the high and low tides, needs measurements taken in the morning and evening. This is because the tides are influenced by the gravitational forces of the moon and the sun, and these forces change throughout the day, affecting the height of the tides. Option (A) is incorrect because the coastal range refers to the extent of a coastline and does not require morning and evening measurements. Option (C) is incorrect because the wavelength of a wave can be measured at any time and does not require specific timing. Option (D) is unrelated to tidal patterns and measurement."

The tidal range, which refers to the difference in water level between high tide and low tide, needs measurements taken in the morning and evening. This is because the tides follow a predictable pattern based on the moon's gravitational pull, and it takes approximately 12 hours and 25 minutes for the tide to go from high to low or low to high. Therefore, to accurately measure and track the tidal range, measurements must be taken in both the morning and evening to capture the full tidal cycle."
