This is because bodies of water, such as oceans, lakes, or rivers, release water vapor into the air through a process called evaporation. This water vapor increases the moisture content in the air, leading to a higher humidity level. Option (B) is unrelated to humidity and refers to shooting, likely in the context of photography or firearms. Option (C) is incorrect because as you move further away from a body of water, the humidity levels tend to decrease. Option (D) is unrelated to humidity and refers to the act of laughing."
