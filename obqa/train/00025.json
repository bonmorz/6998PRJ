Every twenty-four hours and fifty minutes, the moon completes one full orbit around the Earth, creating a tidal cycle. The moon's gravitational pull causes bodies of water, such as oceans, to experience a rise and fall in sea levels, creating tides. This phenomenon is known as tidal swelling. Option (B) is incorrect because bodies of water do not float due to the moon's effect. Option (C) is incorrect because bodies of water do not die. Option (D) is incorrect because bodies of water do not burn due to the moon's effect."
