When the earth tilts towards the sun, it results in warmer temperatures and longer days, which are ideal conditions for mowing the lawn. Option (A) is incorrect because frozen glaciers are more likely to be seen during winter when the earth is tilted away from the sun. Option (C) is incorrect because blizzards are associated with cold temperatures, which are more likely to occur when the earth is tilted away from the sun. Option (D) is incorrect because leaves being raked is typically associated with autumn when the leaves fall off the trees, not when the earth tilts towards the sun."

Option (C) may occur in some regions during certain seasons, but it is not the universal result of the tilt. Option (D) is more associated with the fall season when leaves start to fall from trees. Option (B) is the most relevant answer because as the weather gets warmer, people often start mowing their lawns."
