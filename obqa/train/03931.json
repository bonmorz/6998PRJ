The boiling point of water is the temperature at which it changes from a liquid to a gas. The boiling point is primarily determined by the atmospheric pressure, which remains constant in this question. However, the amount of water to be heated is the main factor that determines the time it takes to reach boiling point.\n\nIn this case, the swimming pool will take the longest to reach a boiling point. This is because a swimming pool contains a significantly larger amount of water compared to the other options (tea kettle, fish tank, bath tub). It will take more time and energy to heat up a larger volume of water, so the swimming pool will take the longest to reach a boiling point.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because a tea kettle contains a relatively small amount of water, so it will heat up faster than the swimming pool. Option (B) is incorrect because a fish tank is typically smaller than a swimming pool, so it will also heat up faster. Option (D) is incorrect because a bath tub is larger than a tea kettle and fish tank, but smaller than a swimming pool, so it will heat up faster than the swimming pool but slower than options A and B."

The boiling point of a liquid depends on its specific heat capacity and the amount of energy needed to convert it to a gas state. Larger bodies of liquid, like swimming pools, have a higher heat capacity and therefore require more energy to reach their boiling point compared to smaller bodies of liquid like tea kettles or fish tanks. Therefore, the swimming pool will take the longest to reach a boiling point. Options (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect because they refer to smaller bodies of liquid that require less energy to reach their boiling point."

This is because a larger volume of water requires more heat energy to increase its temperature.\n\nOn the other hand, options (A), (B), and (D) have smaller volumes and are more likely to heat up faster. A tea kettle usually contains a smaller amount of water, a fish tank is smaller in volume, and a bath tub typically holds less water compared to a swimming pool.
