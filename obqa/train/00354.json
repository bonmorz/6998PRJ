In this scenario, a person can use a cylinder with unit markings to measure the volume accurately. \n\nHere's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Obtain a cylindrical container, such as a measuring cup or a graduated cylinder, which has unit markings along its side.\n\n2. Ensure that the container is clean and dry to avoid any contamination or inaccurate measurements.\n\n3. Place the container on a level surface to ensure a proper measurement.\n\n4. Slowly pour the fruit wine into the cylinder, making sure to pour it carefully to avoid spillage or overflow.\n\n5. Take note of the level of the wine on the unit markings of the cylinder.\n\n6. Read the measurement by considering the bottom of the curved surface of the liquid (also known as the meniscus). This is typically the lowest point of the curved surface.\n\n7. Use the unit markings on the cylinder to determine the volume of the fruit wine. The unit markings could be in milliliters (ml), liters (L), or any other unit of volume, depending on the cylinder used.\n\n8. Record the measured volume, considering the appropriate decimal places based on the unit markings.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because none of the given options are true.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect as a tape measure is used to measure length or distance, not volume.\n\nOption (D) is also incorrect as a thermometer is used to measure temperature, not volume."
