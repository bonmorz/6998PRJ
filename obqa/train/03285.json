                "content": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand what has a positive impact on the environment. Option (A), building large numbers of cars, has a negative impact on the environment because it contributes to air pollution and increases carbon emissions. Option (B), contaminating the ground with poisonous substances, is also harmful to the environment and can lead to soil pollution and contamination of groundwater. Option (C), dumping toxic waste in the ocean, is extremely detrimental to marine ecosystems and can lead to the death of marine life. \n\nThe correct answer is option (D), making sure trash is reused for new purposes. Recycling and reusing trash helps reduce the amount of waste that goes into landfills, conserves natural resources, and decreases the demand for raw materials. Recycling also helps reduce pollution and energy consumption associated with the production of new goods. Overall, reusing trash for new purposes is a positive step towards protecting and preserving the environment."

Option (A), building large numbers of cars, is unlikely to have a positive impact on the environment as it contributes to air pollution, reliance on fossil fuels, and increased traffic congestion. Option (B), contaminating the ground with poisonous substances, is harmful to both the environment and human health. Option (C), dumping toxic waste in the ocean, causes severe damage to marine ecosystems and can result in the death of aquatic life.\n\nThat leaves us with option (D), making sure trash is reused for new purposes. This option has a positive impact on the environment as it promotes recycling and reducing waste. By reusing trash for new purposes, we can reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills or incinerators, conserving resources and reducing pollution. Recycling also helps to conserve energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the manufacturing of new products. Overall, ensuring that trash is reused for new purposes is an environmentally responsible action."
