Option (B) car engines are typically made of various metals such as iron, aluminum, and steel, which are not minerals. Option (C) alcohol is a chemical compound composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms and does not contain minerals. Option (D) electricity is not made of minerals but is the flow of electrons through a conductor. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer as Stonehenge is made of minerals."
