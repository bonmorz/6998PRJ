When a car is moving southwest at high speeds, it will experience wind blowing in the opposite direction (southwest) due to its own movement. This can create an additional force called wind resistance, which opposes the car's motion and can slow it down.\n\nOption (C) is the correct answer because wind blowing in the opposite direction of the car's movement will slow down the car's speed. The other options are incorrect. Option (A) suggests that the wind will break the car's speed, but this is not a commonly used term and does not accurately describe the situation. Option (B) suggests that the car's speed will stall, but this is not a likely outcome. Option (D) suggests that the wind will heighten the car's speed, which is incorrect because the opposing force of the wind will actually slow it down."
