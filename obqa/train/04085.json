Stonefish have the ability to blend in with their surroundings due to their mottled appearance and rough texture, making them nearly invisible when stationary. Option (A) is incorrect because bald eagles are not known for being invisible and are easily recognizable due to their distinctive appearance. Option (C) is also incorrect because cows are large and not known for being invisible. Option (D) is incorrect because hippos are also large and easily visible in their natural habitats."
