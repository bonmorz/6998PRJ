Genetic material is composed of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) which are located in the cells of the body. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because the epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin and does not play a role in genetic inheritance. Option (B) is incorrect because platelets are involved in blood clotting, not genetic transfer. Option (C) is incorrect because plasma is the liquid component of blood and does not contain genetic material."
