A reusable product is one that can be used multiple times, reducing the need for disposable products. Option (A) is incorrect because a plastic cup is generally considered to be disposable. Option (B) is also incorrect because although a soda can can be recycled, it is not typically reused for its original purpose. Option (D) is incorrect because a trash bag is designed to be used once and then discarded. Option (C) is the correct answer because a steel cup can be used multiple times, washed, and reused instead of being thrown away."
