In biology, a membrane is made up of many individual molecules working together to create a barrier that allows certain substances to pass through. The membrane itself has properties and functions that are greater than the individual molecules. \n\nOption (A), a car, does not fulfill the requirement because while a car is made up of many parts working together, it is not necessarily greater than the sum of its parts. Option (C), fire, can be seen as an example of synergy because it is a chemical reaction that occurs when fuel, heat, and oxygen combine. The reaction produces more heat, light, and carbon dioxide than the individual components. However, it is not an item that supports other items. Option (D), a truck, is similar to a car and does not fulfill the requirement of being greater than the sum of its parts. Therefore, the correct answer is (B), membrane."

Options (A) and (D) are incorrect because cars and trucks are individual vehicles, and while they may have multiple parts, they do not work together in large numbers.
