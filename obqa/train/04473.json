One of the main factors that can decrease visibility while driving is bad weather conditions. Local forecasts provide information about the weather conditions in a specific area, including rain, fog, snow, or other factors that can reduce visibility. Option (B) is incorrect because while bad roads can affect driving conditions, they do not specifically decrease visibility. Option (C) is incorrect because music does not have a direct effect on visibility. Option (D) is incorrect because while trees can obstruct visibility in certain situations, they do not always have a negative impact on visibility while driving."
