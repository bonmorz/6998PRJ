They are most likely in flight during this time, as they travel to their wintering grounds. Option (A) is incorrect because nesting typically occurs in the spring when geese are preparing to lay eggs. Option (B) is incorrect because hibernation is a behavior commonly associated with mammals, not birds. Option (D) is incorrect because geese lay their eggs in the spring, not the autumn."
