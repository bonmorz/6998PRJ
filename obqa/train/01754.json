However, in the southern hemisphere, December falls during the summer season. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) division, which refers to the division of the Earth into northern and southern hemispheres. Option (A) is incorrect because it is too broad and encompasses both the northern and southern hemisphere states. Options (C) and (D) are specific locations within a country or region and do not encompass the entire southern hemisphere."
