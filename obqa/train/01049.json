An oil field would be a source of raw materials because it contains crude oil, which is a primary material used to produce various products, such as gasoline, plastics, and lubricants. Options (A), (B), and (C) are not sources of raw materials. A power plant generates electricity, but it does not produce raw materials. A factory is a facility where raw materials are transformed into finished products, so it is not a source of raw materials. A shopping mall is a place where retail stores are located and goods are sold, so it is not a source of raw materials."
