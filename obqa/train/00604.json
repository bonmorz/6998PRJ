The varying number of body parts in different species is attributed to inherited characteristics, meaning it is determined by genetic factors that are passed down from parents to offspring. Option (A) is incorrect because survival is a general concept that applies to all living organisms, not specifically to the number of body parts. Option (B) is incorrect because environmental growth does not determine the number of body parts in a species.

The varying numbers of body parts in different species, such as arachnids and humans, can be attributed to inherited characteristics. Inherited characteristics are traits that are passed down from one generation to the next through genes. These traits determine the physical characteristics and structures of an organism, including the number of body parts. Option (A) is incorrect because while having body parts may aid in survival, the number of body parts itself is not directly connected to survival. Option (B) is not relevant to the question as it does not explain the varying numbers of body parts. Option (D) is also incorrect because developmental abilities do not determine the number of body parts in different species, but rather the genetic information inherited from previous generations."

Option (A) is incorrect because survival is a broad concept that encompasses various aspects of an organism's ability to stay alive and reproduce, but it does not specifically explain why different species have different numbers of body parts. Option (B) is incorrect because environmental growth refers to the physical growth and development of an organism in response to environmental factors and does not specifically explain the variations in body parts.
