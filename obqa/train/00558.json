Animals that build structures for their own species to live in are typically considered more advanced and intelligent. This behavior is most commonly observed in primates, such as chimpanzees and gorillas, who build nests or use caves as shelter. Option (A) is incorrect because while some rodents may build burrows, they do not build structures specifically for their own species. Option (B) is incorrect because reptiles do not exhibit this behavior.

Animals that build structures called houses for their own species to live in are usually primates. Primates, such as certain species of apes and monkeys, are known to build nests or use other forms of shelter for protection and comfort. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because rodents, such as mice and rats, typically do not build structures like houses. They may create burrows or tunnels, but these are not considered houses. \n\nOption (B) is incorrect because reptiles, such as snakes and lizards, do not build structures for their own species to live in. They rely on natural environments like caves, burrows, or vegetation for shelter. \n\nOption (C) is incorrect because carnivores, which are meat-eating animals, do not typically build houses. They may use existing structures or take shelter in caves, but they do not construct houses. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (D) - primate."
