The Sahara desert, located in North Africa, receives the most sunlight among the given options. This is because it is situated closer to the Earth's equator, where sunlight directly hits the surface for a longer duration and at a more perpendicular angle. Northern Canada and northern Russia, being closer to the poles, receive less sunlight due to the tilt of the Earth's axis. The Brazilian rainforest, although receiving a significant amount of sunlight, does not receive as much as the Sahara."
