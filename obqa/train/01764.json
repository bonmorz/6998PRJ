A flexible container is one that can change its shape or size without breaking or permanently deforming. Option (C) of play dough fits this description as it can easily be molded and reshaped into different forms without breaking. Options (A) (car), (B) (bird), and (D) (building) do not fit the criteria of a flexible container as they do not have the ability to change their shape or size without breaking or undergoing significant structural changes."

A flexible container is one that can change its shape without breaking or losing its functionality. Option (C), play dough, fits this definition because it can be molded into different shapes without breaking. Option (A), a car, is not a flexible container because it is a rigid structure and cannot change its shape. Option (B), a bird, is a living organism and not a container. Option (D), a building, is also not a container as it is a fixed structure and cannot change its shape. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) play dough."
