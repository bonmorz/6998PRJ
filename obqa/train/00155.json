A renewable resource is a resource that can be replenished or replaced naturally, so that it is not depleted over time. Of the options given, only option (C) is a potential example of a renewable resource. Murky river fluid is likely referring to water, which is a renewable resource because it goes through the water cycle and is constantly replenished through rainfall. \n\nOption (A) - colored pencils - are not a renewable resource because they are made from wood. Although wood is technically a natural resource, it is not considered renewable if it is not managed sustainably and replaced at the same rate it is consumed.\n\nOption (B) - snow cones - are not a renewable resource because snow is not available year-round and depends on weather conditions. It cannot be easily replenished.\n\nOption (D) - fresh flounder - is not a renewable resource because it is a type of fish. Fish populations can become depleted if overfished, and it takes time for them to replenish their numbers through natural reproduction."

This can be achieved by implementing proper treatment methods to filter and purify the water, making it safe and usable for various purposes.
