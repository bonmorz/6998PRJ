Therefore, it is not the correct answer.\n\n(B) Play doh is a modeling compound that can be molded into different shapes. While its volume can be changed by manipulating it, once it is left undisturbed, it will generally maintain its shape and volume. Therefore, it is also not the correct answer.\n\n(C) Food, in general, can have varying volumes depending on its composition and preparation. For example, cooked pasta may expand in volume compared to its uncooked form. However, many types of food can still have relatively constant volumes, especially if they are contained within a closed container. Therefore, it is less likely to be the correct answer.\n\n(D) Car exhaust refers to the gases that are emitted from the combustion of fuel in a car's engine. These gases, such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and water vapor, are highly dynamic and can expand or contract depending on the temperature and pressure conditions. Therefore, car exhaust is the least likely to have a constant volume, making it the correct answer.\n\nIn summary, based on our knowledge of the properties of different substances, car exhaust is the substance that is least likely to have a constant volume."
