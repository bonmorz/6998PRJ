Copper is a good conductor of heat, so using a copper burner would result in more efficient heat transfer to the pot of water and the twisty noodles. This would make it easier to bring the water to a boil and cook the noodles. Option (A) is incorrect because rubber is not a good conductor of heat, so it would not efficiently heat the pot of water. Option (C) and (D) are also incorrect because wood and plastic are not good conductors of heat and would not efficiently transfer heat to the pot of water."
