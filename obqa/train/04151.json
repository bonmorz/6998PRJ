As the resistance to something increases, it becomes more difficult to perform the task. Therefore, the ease of doing that task will plummet, meaning it will decrease significantly. Option (A) is incorrect because as resistance increases, the ease does not rise. Option (B) is incorrect because \"fly\" does not accurately describe the relationship between resistance and ease. Option (D) is incorrect because \"soar\" implies an increase in ease, which is opposite to what happens when resistance increases."
