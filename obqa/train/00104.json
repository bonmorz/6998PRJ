Iron nails are commonly used for various construction purposes and are strong enough to be driven into different materials with a hammer. \n\nOption (B) states a metal nail. Since metal is a broader term and can refer to a variety of materials, it is not specific enough to determine its suitability for driving in with a hammer. However, many metal nails, such as those made of steel, are also suitable for hammering.\n\nOption (C) states a steel nail. Steel nails are known for their strength and durability, making them ideal for driving in with a hammer.\n\nConsidering the properties of each option, we can conclude that all of these objects would make an ideal object to drive in with a hammer. Therefore, the answer is (D)."
