Metamorphosis refers to the process of a drastic physical transformation or change in an organism's life cycle. Option (A) suggests a live insect, which is the likeliest to undergo metamorphosis. Insects such as butterflies, beetles, and moths undergo metamorphosis as they transition from their larval stage (caterpillar or grub) to their adult stage (butterfly or beetle). Option (B) suggests a human, which does not have a natural metamorphosis process like insects do. Option (C) suggests a plant, which does not typically undergo metamorphosis like insects. Option (D) suggests a dead butterfly, which has already gone through metamorphosis during its life cycle, but does not have the capacity to metamorphose again as it is deceased. Therefore, the likeliest organism to metamorphose is a live insect."

Metamorphosis is a biological process where an organism undergoes a distinct change in its form and structure as it develops. Insects, such as butterflies, go through complete metamorphosis which includes distinct stages like larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult. Therefore, it is most likely that a live insect would undergo metamorphosis. The other options, a human, a plant, and a dead butterfly, do not typically undergo metamorphosis in the same way as insects."
