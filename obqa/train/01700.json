Mating allows for reproduction and the production of offspring, which can contribute to population growth. \n\nOption (C), more food, would likely have a positive effect on the population rather than causing a decrease. If there is an abundance of food available, it can support a larger population of animals. \n\nOption (D), growth, is not specific enough to determine whether it would cause an increase or decrease in population. Growth could refer to the growth of individuals within the population or the growth of the population as a whole. Without more information, we cannot determine the effect on population size. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) construction activity, as it can lead to a decrease in an animal species' population by negatively impacting their habitat."
