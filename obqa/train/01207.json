When something is condensed, it means that it has undergone a phase change from a gas to a liquid state. It does not necessarily mean that it becomes wetter, but rather that the particles have come closer together and formed a liquid. Option (A) is the correct answer. Option (B) is incorrect because a liquid lake is different from the concept of condensation. Option (C) is incorrect because becoming molten liquid refers to melting, not condensation. Option (D) is incorrect because being damp inside is not directly related to condensation."

When something is condensed, it means that it has changed from a gas or vapor form to a liquid or solid form. Option (A) is correct because condensation often involves the release of heat, which can cause moisture to form and make the substance wetter. Option (B) is incorrect because a liquid lake is not necessarily condensed. Option (C) is incorrect because becoming molten liquid refers to the process of melting, not condensation. Option (D) is incorrect because dampness is not always associated with condensation, and condensation can occur without any moisture being present."
