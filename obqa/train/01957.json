Sand clay, option (A), can be considered an inexhaustible resource because it is constantly being produced through natural weathering processes and can be found in abundance around the world. \n\nOption (B), fossil fuels, is incorrect because fossil fuels are finite resources that are formed over millions of years and will eventually run out. \n\nOption (C), cars, is incorrect because cars are not a resource but rather a man-made object that relies on resources such as fuel, metals, and plastics to function. \n\nOption (D), metals, can also be incorrect depending on the specific type of metal. While some metals are abundant and can be recycled, others are finite resources that can be depleted if not managed sustainably. Therefore, it is safest to choose option (A) as the answer."
