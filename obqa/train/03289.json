When a lake is fully drained and evaporated, it means that all the water has evaporated into the air. Therefore, there is no water left in the lake, so the correct answer is (B) the lake will be gone. Option (A) is incorrect because if the lake is fully drained and evaporated, there is no water in it to be full. Option (C) is incorrect because moisture refers to the presence of water, which does not exist if the lake is fully evaporated. Option (D) is incorrect because being wet means being covered or saturated with water, which does not apply if the lake is fully evaporated."
