When a sound is produced, such as the vibrations of a cello, those sound waves travel through the air and reach the ear. The ear then detects these sound waves and converts them into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain as sound. Option (B) is incorrect because taste testing does not involve sound. Option (C) is incorrect because a silent movie does not have sound. Option (D) is incorrect because a comic book does not produce sound."
