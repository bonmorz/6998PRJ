Sparrows build their homes, or nests, in specific locations that provide suitable shelter and resources. By observing where a sparrow frequently consumes food, such as seeds or insects, a person can deduce the general area where the sparrow's nest is likely to be located. Option (A) is incorrect because looking at a sparrow's face does not provide any information about its nest location. Option (B) is also incorrect because a detailed map does not reveal specific nest locations. Option (C) is untrue because a sparrow's birthplace does not determine where it builds its nest."
