Option (C) is the correct answer because a bamboo stalk, like any other plant, needs soil to anchor its roots and extract nutrients for growth. Option (A) is incorrect because a planter is a container that can hold soil, but it does not necessarily need soil itself. Option (B) is incorrect because a painted house is not a living organism and does not need soil. Option (D) is incorrect because an industrial plant refers to a factory or manufacturing facility and is not related to plants or soil."
