Option (A) suggests using your feet to pedal somewhere, which would imply using a bicycle or walking. Bicycles and walking are both environmentally friendly modes of transportation because they do not produce carbon emissions. Option (B) suggests using a sedan, which can vary in terms of environmental friendliness depending on its fuel efficiency and emissions. Option (C) suggests putting the pedal to the metal in a truck, which is not environmentally friendly because trucks tend to have lower fuel efficiency and produce higher levels of carbon emissions. Option (D) suggests riding a motorcycle, which can vary in terms of environmental friendliness depending on its emissions and fuel efficiency. However, compared to a sedan or truck, motorcycles generally have a smaller carbon footprint and can be considered more environmentally friendly.
