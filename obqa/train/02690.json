Option (C) is incorrect because conception refers to the beginning of pregnancy, which occurs before birth. Option (D) is incorrect because fetus development refers to the time when the person was still in the womb, and the scar would not have been acquired during this period."

This can happen due to a variety of reasons, such as injuries, surgeries, or infections. As the question specifies that the scar is on the face, it suggests that the person obtained the scar after they were born. Option (A) is therefore the correct answer.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because it suggests that the scar formed at the time of delivery, which is highly unlikely. Scarring typically occurs after a wound has formed and begins to heal, which would not happen during the process of being born.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because scars cannot form at the time of conception. Conception refers to the fertilization of an egg and the start of pregnancy, which occurs internally within the body and would not result in any external scars.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the development of a fetus occurs within the womb and does not involve any external scars. Scarring can only occur in the outer layers of the skin, not during early stages of fetal development."
