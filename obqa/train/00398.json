Dogwoods and oaks are both native tree species that provide many environmental benefits such as oxygen production, wildlife habitat, and soil stabilization. Options (A), (B), and (C) are all harmful to the environment. Cutting down trees and shrubs reduces the amount of greenery and can lead to habitat destruction. Driving a gas guzzling car contributes to air pollution and increases carbon emissions. Using Styrofoam plates and cups generates non-biodegradable waste that can harm wildlife and pollute the environment."
