Option (A) is correct because many creatures, including humans and animals, use sound as a means of communication. They produce sounds through vocal cords, vocalizations, or other means to convey messages, warnings, or mating calls. Option (B) is incorrect because plants do not have vocal cords or means of producing sound. Option (C) is incorrect because water does not produce sounds for communication. Option (D) is incorrect because planets do not have the ability to produce or receive sound for communication."
