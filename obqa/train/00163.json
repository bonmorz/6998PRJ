Butter is commonly stored in containers made of plastic or glass.\n\nOption (C) tea is typically housed in paper or cardboard packaging. While tea infusers or tea pots may be made of metal, the question is asking about the housing of the item itself.\n\nOption (D) syrup is commonly housed in plastic or glass containers. Similar to tea, syrup may be served or poured using objects made of metal, but the housing of the syrup itself is not made of metal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B) cola. Cola refers to carbonated beverages such as Coca-Cola or Pepsi, which are typically packaged in aluminum cans or glass bottles. Both of these materials contain metal."
