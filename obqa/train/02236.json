Option (A) is the correct answer because it suggests that a lumber company has removed some trees from the forest, allowing more sunlight to penetrate through the gaps in the canopy.

Option (C) is incorrect because it suggests a literal piece of the sun has been placed on the forest floor, which is not possible.
