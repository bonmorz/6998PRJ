Chloroplasts are the organelles responsible for photosynthesis in plant cells. They contain chlorophyll which gives plants their green color.

They are also commonly found in fruit cells, stem cells, and petal cells (option D). However, chloroplasts are rarely found in root hair cells (option A) because these cells are specialized for absorbing water and nutrients from the soil, rather than for photosynthesis. Option B is incorrect because chloroplasts are found in eukaryotic plant cells, which have a distinct nucleus, rather than in prokaryotic cells."
