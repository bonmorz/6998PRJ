When faced with a predator like an orca, a squid would push water out of its body as a defensive strategy. Squids have special organs called siphons, which they use to forcefully expel water and propel themselves away from danger. This is called jet propulsion and allows the squid to swiftly escape from the orca. Options (B), (C), and (D) do not possess this specific adaptation and would have different defensive mechanisms to evade predators."
