A consumer is an organism that obtains its energy and nutrients by consuming other organisms. They are unable to produce their own sustenance, meaning they cannot create their own food. Option (A) and (B) are incorrect because consumers are capable of producing offspring or children. Option (C) is also incorrect because while emotions are a characteristic of some organisms, it is not directly related to the ability to produce sustenance."

A consumer, in this context, refers to an organism that consumes other organisms for energy and nutrients.

This distinguishes them from producers, which are organisms that can produce their own food. Option (A) is incorrect because while consumers may produce offspring, this is not the main characteristic that distinguishes them from producers.
