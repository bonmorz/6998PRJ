Light travels at a speed of approximately 186,282 miles per second or 299,792 kilometers per second. \n\nThe order of the planets from the sun is: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto, although traditionally classified as a planet, is now considered a dwarf planet.\n\nSince the question asks about the \"final time length\" for light from the sun to arrive, we need to consider the time it takes for light to reach each planet and choose the planet that is furthest from the sun.\n\nBased on this information, we can rule out options (A), (B), and (D) since none of them are the furthest planet from the sun. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Pluto."

The light from the sun travels at a constant speed of approximately 299,792 kilometers per second.
