If a raptor loses weight, it will have an easier time circling high up in the air. This is because a lighter weight reduces the amount of effort needed for flight, allowing the raptor to remain in the air for longer periods of time while searching for prey. Option (A) is incorrect because eating a goldfish cracker does not require any specific weight loss. Option (B) is unrelated to the behavior of raptors and is not supported by any evidence.
