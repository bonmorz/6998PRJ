Anthracite is a type of coal that is known for its high carbon content and low impurity levels. Burning anthracite coal releases a significant amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change and air pollution. Therefore, using less anthracite coal would have a positive impact on the ecosystem by reducing carbon emissions and air pollution. The other options are not directly related to the environmental impact of anthracite coal. Option (A) is unrelated to coal consumption. Option (C) and (D) may be indirectly affected by the reduced use of coal, but they are not the primary focus of the question."

Option (C) is incorrect because coal plants are the entities that use anthracite, so using less of it would not have a positive impact on them. Option (D) is also incorrect because electric companies may use a variety of energy sources, and while using less anthracite may impact their operations, it does not have a direct positive impact on them."
