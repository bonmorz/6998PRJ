One basic characteristic of living things is the ability to carry out respiration, which involves the exchange of gases (usually oxygen and carbon dioxide) to obtain energy.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because crying is a specific response in humans and some animals, but it is not a universal characteristic of all living organisms. Option (C) is incorrect because doing magic is not a characteristic of living organisms, but rather a fictional or supernatural ability. Option (D) is incorrect because walking on a rope is a specific skill that only certain organisms, such as trained circus performers, can do, and it is not a universal characteristic of all living organisms."
