Amphibians are ectothermic, meaning their body temperature is regulated by external heat sources. Their body temperature typically matches the temperature of their surroundings, which can be cooler than warm-blooded animals. Option (B) is correct because amphibians typically have cooler blood compared to warm-blooded animals. Options (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect because they describe temperatures that are either warmer or hotter than what is typically associated with amphibians."
