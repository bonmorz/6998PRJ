When the sun is straight above us, it is typically around noon, which is the time when people often take a break from work or have their lunch break. Option (A) is incorrect because we usually wake up before the sun is straight above us. Option (B) is incorrect because people typically start work before noon.

Option (D) is also incorrect because the time of going home can vary and may or may not coincide with the sun being directly above.
