Option (A) a chipmunk is correct because chipmunks are known for their behavior of collecting and storing food, such as acorns and seeds, in burrows or other underground caches. This behavior is called hoarding and helps them survive during periods when food is scarce, such as the winter. Option (B) a cactus is incorrect because cacti are plants and do not have the ability to hoard food. Option (C) a chihuahua is incorrect because chihuahuas are domesticated dogs and rely on their owners for sustenance rather than hoarding food. Option (D) a cat is also incorrect because while cats may hunt and catch their own food, they do not typically hoard it away for future use."
