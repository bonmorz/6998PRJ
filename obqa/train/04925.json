Option (A) can be eliminated because having a clear sky with no clouds would typically result in bright sunlight. Option (B) can also be eliminated because if the sun is shining, it would illuminate the sky rather than causing darkness. Option (D) is similar to option (A) and can be eliminated for the same reason.\n\nOption (C), \"it's about to storm,\" is the most viable reason for the darkness. Before a storm, thick clouds can gather and block sunlight, creating darkness even in the afternoon. This phenomenon is often observed before heavy rain or thunderstorms. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer as it provides a reasonable explanation for the dark sky despite it being afternoon on a summer's day."

The question states that it is only afternoon on a summer's day, so we can assume that the sun should be shining and the sky should be relatively bright.\n\nOption (A) states that the sky lacks clouds. If the sky lacks clouds, it means that there is no obstruction between the sun and the ground. Therefore, the sunlight should be able to reach the ground and it should not be dark overhead. This option is incorrect.\n\nOption (B) states that the sun is shining. Since it is only afternoon on a summer's day, we can assume that the sun is indeed shining. However, this option does not explain why it is dark overhead. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.\n\nOption (D) states that clouds are completely absent. If there are no clouds in the sky, it means that there is no obstruction to the sunlight. Therefore, the sunlight should be able to reach the ground and it should not be dark overhead. This option is incorrect.\n\nOption (C) states that it is about to storm. In some cases, dark clouds can move in before a storm, blocking the sunlight and causing it to be dark even though it is only afternoon. This option provides a viable reason for the darkness overhead on a summer's day. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer.\n\nIt is important to note that while this explanation provides a logical reasoning for the given scenario, actual weather conditions and the presence of storms can be influenced by various factors and may vary in reality."
