When invasive plants are introduced to an ecosystem, they often have no natural predators or competitors and can therefore rapidly reproduce and spread. This can lead to overpopulation of the invasive species, which can outcompete and displace native plants and disrupt the balance of the ecosystem. Option (B) is incorrect because the presence of invasive plants does not directly affect weather patterns. Option (C) is incorrect because rashes are not a direct consequence of invasive plants.
