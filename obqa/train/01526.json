Trains have the potential to transport large quantities of goods efficiently, reducing the need for multiple individual vehicles. Mail trucks and motorcycles are usually smaller and consume less fuel compared to larger vehicles like garbage trucks."

Garbage trucks are the correct answer because they transport waste to landfills, which can release harmful gases and contaminate soil and water. Trains, mail trucks, and motorcycles do not necessarily have a negative impact on the environment. Trains are often considered a more environmentally friendly mode of transportation compared to cars because they can carry a larger number of passengers or goods at once, reducing overall emissions. Mail trucks and motorcycles, on their own, do not have inherent negative impacts on the environment. The correct answer is (A) garbage trucks because they are directly involved in the disposal of waste, which can harm the environment if not managed properly."

Option (A) states that garbage trucks go to a place that has a negative impact on the environment. This is likely the correct answer because garbage trucks are responsible for transporting waste to landfills, which can have significant environmental consequences due to pollution and methane gas emissions. Option (B) suggests that trains have a negative impact on the environment, but this is not necessarily true as trains are generally considered a more environmentally friendly mode of transportation compared to cars or airplanes. Option (C) suggests that mail trucks have a negative impact, but this is also not necessarily true as mail trucks are typically smaller and have lower emissions compared to other vehicles. Option (D) states that motorcycles have a negative impact, but this is not entirely accurate as motorcycles, if properly maintained and operated, can be more fuel-efficient and have lower emissions compared to cars. Overall, option (A) is the most appropriate choice based on the given information."
