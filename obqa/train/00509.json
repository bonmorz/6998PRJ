When it is sleeting outdoors, it means that the precipitation is in the form of small ice pellets or frozen raindrops. This occurs when raindrops pass through a layer of freezing air and solidify before reaching the ground. Option (A) is incorrect because the precipitation did not melt, but instead solidified. Option (B) is incorrect because evaporation refers to the process of liquid water turning into water vapor, which is not relevant to sleeting. Option (D) is incorrect because rain refers to liquid water falling from the clouds, whereas sleet is frozen precipitation."
