In this case, a deer munching grass is an example of a consumer because it is directly obtaining energy by consuming plant material. Option (B) is incorrect because plants are producers, not consumers. Option (C) is a correct answer because a squirrel eating a bug is also an example of a consumer. However, option (A) is more applicable since it is a clearer example of a consumer. Option (D) is incorrect because a wolf eating a deer is an example of a predator-prey relationship rather than a consumer."
