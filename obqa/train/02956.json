Combustion involves the chemical reaction between oxygen and the material, resulting in the release of heat and light.\n\nOption (B) oil and water mixing is not a chemical reaction. It is a physical process called emulsification, where the oil and water form a mixture. The molecules of oil and water do not undergo any chemical changes.\n\nOption (C) steel and iron is not a chemical reaction. Steel is an alloy made primarily of iron and carbon. When steel and iron come into contact, there may be physical changes (such as rusting), but there is no chemical reaction occurring.\n\nOption (D) play dog is not a chemical reaction.
