If the soil in a village seems to be nutrient deficient, it is likely because there has been too much cultivation. Continuous cultivation without proper soil management practices can lead to nutrient depletion, as crops continuously extract nutrients from the soil without enough replenishment. Option (A) is incorrect because soil cannot feel emotions like anger. Option (B) is unlikely to be the cause unless the dogs are digging up the soil and causing disruption. Option (C) is not a scientifically supported explanation for nutrient deficiency in soil."
