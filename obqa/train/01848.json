The answer is (D) coastal water. \n\nCoastal water contains a higher concentration of salt compared to other types of water such as river water, swamp water, or lake water. This higher concentration of salt lowers the freezing point of the water, making it more difficult for it to freeze compared to the other types of water.\n\nWhen water freezes into ice, the molecules slow down and arrange themselves into a crystalline structure. This happens when the temperature of the water reaches its freezing point, which is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) for pure water.\n\nHowever, when there are impurities present in the water, such as salt in coastal water, the freezing point is lowered. This means that coastal water requires a lower temperature to freeze compared to pure water. As a result, when the temperature is low but still above the freezing point of the coastal water, it will remain in its liquid form, while the other types of water, with their lower salt concentrations, will freeze and turn into ice.\n\nTherefore, ice made from coastal water would melt when the others stay frozen because the freezing point of coastal water is lower due to the presence of salt."
