Options (A), (B), and (C) are states that are not typically associated with arid climates and often receive more rainfall than Arizona."

New York is situated in the northeastern part of the United States and also experiences moderate to high levels of rainfall due to the presence of the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. Florida, located in the Southeast, is known for its humid and subtropical climate, which leads to frequent rain showers and thunderstorms.\n\nOn the other hand, Arizona is positioned in the southwestern region, characterized by a desert climate. Deserts typically have low rainfall due to their geographical features such as mountains blocking moisture-laden air, resulting in arid conditions. Arizona, known for its hot and dry climate, receives relatively less rainfall compared to the other three states.\n\nTherefore, the state that would receive the least amount of rainfall is Arizona."
