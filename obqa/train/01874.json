The longer you drive away from your house, the smaller it will eventually look.

Option (A) is incorrect because the appearance of a house being \"dead\" is not related to the distance at which it is viewed. Option (B) is also incorrect because as we move away from an object, it appears smaller, not larger. Option (D) is unrelated and does not pertain to the visual perception of objects."
