A river can push tin cans down its path because it has motion. The flowing water exerts a force on the tin cans, causing them to move downstream. Option (B) is incorrect because being wet is a characteristic of water, not a reason why it can push objects. Option (C) is unrelated to the ability of a river to push objects. Option (D) may be true in the sense that the force exerted by the flowing water can be strong enough to move objects, but it is not the primary reason why a river can push tin cans.
