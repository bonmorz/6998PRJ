Dogs have a keen sense of smell and hearing, which allow them to sense and locate their prey. Option (A) is incorrect because while hunting, a dog's focus is on locating and catching prey, not on drinking. Option (B) is unrelated to hunting and is not mentioned in the question prompt. Option (D) is unrelated to hunting as well and suggests a desire to play rather than hunt. Only option (C) mentions the ability of a hunting dog to tell where its victim, or prey, is located."
