When the power cable of a game console is attached to the wall, electricity flows from the wall, through the power cable, and into the game console. Option (A) is incorrect because the plug is where the power cable is connected to the wall, but it does not receive the electricity. Option (B) is also incorrect because the power cable is simply the conduit for the electricity. Option (C) is incorrect because the electricity does not stay in the wall, but rather flows through it to reach the game console."
