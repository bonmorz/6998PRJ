Migration refers to the movement of a group of animals from one place to another, typically in search of better resources or climate. Option (A) is the correct answer because robins flying from Minneapolis to Miami is a seasonal movement that many bird species undertake to follow food sources and warmer weather. Option (B) is incorrect because geese flying to bother people in a park is not a migration behavior, but rather a nuisance. Option (C) is incorrect because moving bison to a different pasture is not a long-distance movement characteristic of migration. Option (D) is incorrect because mice running from a fox is a form of escape, not migration."
