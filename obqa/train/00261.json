An electrical insulator is a material that does not allow the flow of electric current. Metal (option A) is incorrect because it is a good conductor of electricity. Cement (option B) is also incorrect because it contains conductive materials and can conduct electricity. Stone (option C) is incorrect because some types of stone, such as quartz, can conduct electricity. Brick (option D) is the correct answer because it is made of non-conductive materials like clay and shale, and therefore acts as an insulator."
