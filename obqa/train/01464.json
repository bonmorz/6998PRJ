This means that there needs to be a continuous path for the electric current to flow from the power source to the light bulb and back to the power source. Option (B) is incorrect because if the light is unplugged, it is not connected to the power source and the circuit is not complete. Option (C) is incorrect because the destruction of the house would likely lead to a loss of power, making it impossible to turn the light on.
