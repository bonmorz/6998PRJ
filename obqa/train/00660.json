When the cup is placed on a heated plate, the plate transfers heat to the cup, helping to maintain its temperature. Option (A) is incorrect because cooking coffee in the oven would make it too hot and potentially ruin the coffee. Option (B) is also incorrect because using a torch would likely burn the coffee and the cup. Option (C) may initially warm up the coffee, but once the sun goes away, the coffee will cool down. Using a heated plate is the most effective and controlled method to keep a cup of coffee warm."

This is because a heated plate provides gentle and consistent warmth that can keep the coffee at a desired temperature for a longer period of time.
