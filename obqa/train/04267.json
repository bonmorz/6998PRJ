When a person is stranded on a desert for a week without clothes, they are likely to perish. This is because exposure to extreme temperatures, dehydration, lack of shelter, and other survival necessities can lead to death. Option (A) is incorrect because evaporation refers to the process of converting a liquid into vapor, it is not relevant to the scenario. Option (B) is unlikely because deserts are typically characterized by arid landscapes with little vegetation. Option (C) is also unlikely because deserts can have extreme temperatures during the day and freezing temperatures at night, but without clothes, a person is not protected from these temperature extremes."

If someone is stranded in a desert without clothes for a week, they are likely to perish, or die, due to a combination of factors. Without protection from the sun, they would be exposed to extreme heat and risk dehydration and heatstroke. Without clothing, they would also be vulnerable to injuries from the environment, such as cuts and scrapes from sharp rocks or thorny plants. Additionally, without food and water, their bodies would not be able to sustain themselves, leading to starvation and further dehydration. Options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the conditions and challenges one would face when stranded in a desert without clothes."

If someone is stranded in a desert without clothes, they would be exposed to extreme heat during the day and cold temperatures at night.

Option (A) is incorrect because while sweat does evaporate from the body, it does not result in complete evaporation.

Option (C) is unlikely because deserts typically have extreme temperatures during the day and can be cold at night, but freezing temperatures are not typically associated with deserts.
