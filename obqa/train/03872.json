Electric wires are designed to conduct electricity and it is important to avoid making contact with them to prevent electric shock. Options (A), (B), and (C) all involve materials that are good conductors of electricity, which means they would increase the risk of electric shock. Option (D), on the other hand, suggests wrapping the electric wire in thick cotton. Cotton is a poor conductor of electricity, so it would provide insulation and decrease the risk of electric shock."
