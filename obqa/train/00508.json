When a baseball is hit with a bat, the particles (atoms and molecules) of the ball vibrate. This is because the impact of the bat transfers energy to the ball, causing its particles to vibrate. Option (A) is also correct as the ball can fly after being hit, but option (B) is a more accurate and immediate response to the impact. Option (C) is incorrect as particles do not have the ability to talk. Option (D) is incorrect because the ball does not roll in this context; rolling refers to the movement of a ball on a surface, not the immediate result of being hit."
