Special plant tissues, specifically the xylem and phloem, are responsible for transporting water, nutrients, and other essential substances throughout the plant. Option (A) is incorrect because dirt is not transported within the plant. Option (C) is incorrect because animals are not transported within the plant; they may interact with the plant externally, but they do not travel through the plant's tissues. Option (D) is incorrect because rage is an emotion and cannot be physically transported through plant tissues."
