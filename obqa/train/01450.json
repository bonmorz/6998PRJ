A tumbler is a machine that uses friction to wear down the rock and give it a weathered appearance. Option (A) is incorrect because simply putting the rock in a bag will not cause weathering. Option (B) is incorrect because putting the rock in a yard will not cause weathering unless there are specific weathering agents present (such as rain, wind, etc.). Option (C) is incorrect because putting the rock in a dish will not cause any weathering."
