When two objects with different temperatures come into contact, heat can transfer from the warmer object to the cooler object. Holding hands involves direct contact between two individuals, and if one person's hands are warmer than the other's, heat will transfer from one person to the other. Option (A) is incorrect because a cold shower does not provide a source of heat. Option (C) is incorrect because holding ice will actually result in heat transferring from your hands to the ice, making your hands colder.
