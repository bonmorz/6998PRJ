Option (A) states that driving gas guzzlers, which refers to vehicles that consume large amounts of fuel, has a negative impact on the environment as it contributes to air pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases. Option (C) states that littering has a negative impact as it pollutes the environment and harms wildlife. Option (D) suggests that unchecked consumerism, or excessive consumption without regard for sustainability, also has a negative impact on the environment as it leads to overconsumption and depletion of resources.\n\nIn contrast, option (B) states that canvas grocery sacks have a positive impact on the environment. This is because canvas bags are reusable and can replace single-use plastic bags that contribute to plastic pollution and harm marine life. By using canvas bags, fewer single-use plastics are being produced and discarded, leading to a reduction in waste and pollution. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer as it has a positive impact on the environment."

Option (C), littering, also has a negative impact on the environment because it contributes to pollution and can harm wildlife. Option (D), unchecked consumerism, can lead to excessive resource consumption and environmental degradation.\n\nOption (B), canvas grocery sacks, is the correct answer because they have a positive impact on the environment. Canvas grocery sacks are reusable, reducing the need for single-use plastic bags. Plastic bags are a significant source of pollution, and by using canvas sacks instead, we can reduce plastic waste and the energy required to produce them. Reusable bags also help to conserve resources and reduce the carbon footprint associated with bag production and disposal."

Option (C) is incorrect because littering is harmful to the environment as it can lead to pollution and ecological damage. Option (D) is also incorrect because unchecked consumerism refers to excessive and unsustainable consumption, which can contribute to resource depletion and environmental degradation.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B) - canvas grocery sacks. Canvas grocery sacks are reusable and eco-friendly alternatives to single-use plastic bags. By using canvas grocery sacks, it reduces the need for plastic bags, which helps to reduce plastic pollution and its impact on marine life and ecosystems. Canvas grocery sacks can be used repeatedly and are more sustainable, making them a positive choice for the environment."
