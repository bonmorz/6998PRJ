Option (C), using a table lamp, provides artificial light that can serve as a substitute for sunlight. Option (A), throwing the seeds away, is incorrect because it does not promote growth. Option (B), telling the plants to grow up, is not a practical or effective method for promoting growth. Option (D), mowing down the grass to nothingness, can actually hinder seed growth by removing necessary nutrients and creating a harsh environment for the seeds."
