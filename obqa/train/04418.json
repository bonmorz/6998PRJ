Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another. The degree to which a material refracts light depends on its refractive index. The refractive index of a material is a measure of how much the speed of light is reduced when it passes through that particular material. The greater the refractive index, the more the light is bent.\n\nIn this case, a cardboard box would least refract light among the given options. Cardboard is made of paper, which has a relatively low refractive index. When light passes through a cardboard box, the bending or refraction of light is minimal because the refractive index of cardboard is closer to that of air. \n\nOn the other hand, a bottle, a gem, and a diamond have different compositions that can result in higher refractive indices. Therefore, they would have a greater ability to refract light compared to a cardboard box."

Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one material to another.
