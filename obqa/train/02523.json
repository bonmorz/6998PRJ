When two objects are in contact, heat will transfer from the object with higher temperature to the object with lower temperature until they reach thermal equilibrium. In this case, the hot tea has a higher temperature than the iced tea. Therefore, heat will transfer from the hot tea to the iced tea, causing the hot tea to become colder and the iced tea to become warmer. Option (A) is incorrect because it is unrelated to the question. Option (C) is incorrect because the iced tea will become warmer, not colder. Option (D) is unrelated to the question and is a play on words."
