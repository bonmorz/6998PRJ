When someone is starving, they require food that can provide them with essential nutrients and calories to sustain their body. A coconut is a good option because it contains both water and meat. Coconut water is rich in electrolytes and can help prevent dehydration, while coconut meat is a good source of carbohydrates, healthy fats, and some minerals. Option (A) is incorrect because while water is essential for hydration, it does not provide the necessary nutrients for long-term sustenance. Options (B) and (C) are not viable options as apple stems and a dried leaf do not contain enough calories or nutrients to save someone who is starving."
