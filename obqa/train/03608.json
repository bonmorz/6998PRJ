Many species, such as birds and certain marine animals, have small amounts of magnetite in their bodies which helps them navigate during their migrations. Magnetite acts like a compass needle, aligning with the Earth's magnetic field and helping these animals stay on their migratory paths. Option (A) is incorrect because hibernation is a period of inactivity and does not involve navigation. Option (C) is incorrect because metamorphosis is the process of going through a transformation, such as a butterfly emerging from a cocoon, and does not involve navigation.
