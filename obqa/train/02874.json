When a person needs to relocate a light to another room without physically leaving that room, they can redirect the light using reflections. By placing a mirror or reflective surface in the original room and angling it in such a way that it reflects the light towards the desired room, the person can effectively \"move\" the light without physically relocating it.

Option (B) is irrelevant and destructive, as throwing the light in the yard has nothing to do with relocating it.
