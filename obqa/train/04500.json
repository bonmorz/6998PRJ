A willow, like any other plant, is able to make its own energy through the process of photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose, which is a form of energy that plants can use for their own growth and development. Option (A) is incorrect because plants cannot create rain. Option (C) is partially correct, as plants use sunlight during photosynthesis, but they do not create sunshine. Option (D) is incorrect because plants cannot create snow."
