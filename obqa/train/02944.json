Water treatment processes typically remove harmful substances such as feces, dirt, and mercury from the water. Harmless dissolved rocks, on the other hand, are not harmful and can remain in the water even after treatment. Option (A) is incorrect because feces are typically removed during water treatment. Option (B) is incorrect because dirt is also typically removed during water treatment. Option (D) is incorrect because mercury is a harmful substance and would not be present in water after treatment."
