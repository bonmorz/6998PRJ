Old age typically refers to the final stages of life, and it is more likely for adults to die of old age compared to children, infants, or even high-school students. While it is possible for people of any age to pass away due to various reasons, adults, who have already lived a substantial portion of their expected lifespan, are more likely to experience the effects of aging and eventually pass away from natural causes."

Therefore, adults are most likely to die of old age as they have reached a more advanced stage in their life expectancy compared to children, infants, and high-school students. Option (B) is incorrect because children have not reached adulthood and therefore cannot die of old age. Option (C) is incorrect because infants have not yet reached adulthood either. Option (D) is incorrect because reasonable high-school students are still young and have not yet reached adulthood."

Generally, adults are more likely to die of old age compared to children, infants, or high-school students. As individuals age, their bodies go through physiological changes and are more prone to age-related diseases and conditions. Children and infants have a longer life expectancy compared to adults because they are in a stage of rapid growth and development. High-school students, while they may be reasonably healthy, still have a longer life expectancy compared to adults as they have not yet reached the stage of life where age-related health issues become more common. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely answer based on general knowledge of aging and life expectancy."
