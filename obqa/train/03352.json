Some animals have certain behaviors that are innate and do not require any prior exposure or learning. These behaviors are built into their genetic makeup and are passed down from generation to generation. They are crucial life actions that are necessary for survival. Option (B) and (C) are incorrect because animals do not learn these behaviors in school or at a special training school. Option (D) is incorrect because animals do not possess magical powers, their behaviors are based on biological mechanisms."

These instincts are passed down through generations and are crucial for the animal's survival and reproduction. Option (B) is incorrect because animals do not go to school to learn these behaviors.

The correct answer is (A), \"it is built into their very being.\" This answer is based on the concept of instinct, which is an innate and fixed pattern of behavior in animals. \n\nAnimals are born with certain instincts that allow them to perform essential life actions without prior exposure or training. These instincts are genetic and are passed down from generation to generation. They are built into the animals' DNA and are a result of evolution and natural selection.\n\nInstincts help animals survive and reproduce by ensuring that they can perform necessary behaviors without having to learn them. For example, baby birds instinctively know how to open their mouths and beg for food when their parents approach the nest. They do not need to be taught this behavior, as it is instinctual.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because animals do not attend school and therefore cannot be taught in a formal education setting. Option (C) is also incorrect because animals do not attend special schools for training. Option (D), having magical powers, is not a scientifically supported explanation for how animals know these crucial life actions."
