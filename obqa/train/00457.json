Extensive logging activity involves cutting down trees, which can have negative consequences for the forest and its biodiversity. Logging removes the habitat and food sources for many different species of animals, resulting in a decrease in the overall biodiversity of the forest. Option (A) is incorrect because logging does not directly affect the water content of a forest. Option (B) is also incorrect because logging does not remove soil from a forest. Option (C) is incorrect because logging activity does not reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in a forest; in fact, it may release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere due to the burning or decay of felled trees."
