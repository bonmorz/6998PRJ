When syrup, which is typically non-flammable, is added to vodka, the flammable portion of the vodka will rise to the top. This is because alcohol, which is the flammable component of vodka, is less dense than syrup. Therefore, it floats on top of the syrup. Option (B) is incorrect because the flammable portion does not fall. Option (C) is incorrect because sinking implies movement downwards, which is not the case. Option (D) is incorrect because settling implies the flammable portion is moving downwards and becoming more consolidated, which is not the case."
