The webbing helps to distribute their weight and provides better traction on water, making it easier for them to move quickly across the surface. Option (B) is incorrect because a tail does not help with running across a pond. Option (C) is incorrect because although flamingos have wings, they are not used for running across water. Option (D) is incorrect because a beak also does not assist with running across a pond."

Flamingos have webbed feet, which means that their toes are connected by a thin membrane of skin. This webbing increases the surface area of their feet, allowing them to distribute their weight more evenly and effectively distribute force when moving across water. This adaptation helps them to stay balanced and prevent sinking when running across a pond.\n\nOptions (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because they do not provide the same advantages as webbed feet when it comes to running across a pond. A tail is not directly related to their ability to run across water, and wings are more useful for flying rather than running across a pond. A beak is used for feeding and is not a factor in their ability to traverse water."
