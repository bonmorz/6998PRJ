Option (B) is the correct answer because it describes a toddler banging with a stick while their parent hammers. This behavior is something that the child learns through observation and imitation of their parent. Option (A) is incorrect because it describes an inherited characteristic, not a learned one. Option (C) is incorrect because freckles are typically a result of genetics and not something that is learned.
