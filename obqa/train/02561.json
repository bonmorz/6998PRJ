Crude oil is a fossil fuel, formed over millions of years from the remains of ancient plants and animals. Therefore, to produce gasoline, raw materials such as fossilized matter are necessary. Option (A) is incorrect because although air is necessary for combustion, it is not a raw material in the production of gasoline. Option (B) is incorrect because water is not involved in the formation of gasoline. Option (C) is incorrect because sand is not a raw material in gasoline production."
