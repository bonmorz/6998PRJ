This is true because while biofuels do release CO2 when burned, they are considered better for the environment compared to fossil fuels like oil due to their lower carbon footprint.\n\nOption (B) states that biofuel is without flaws. This is not true because like any energy source, biofuel has its drawbacks and limitations. For example, it can require large amounts of land and water for production, which can lead to deforestation and water depletion.\n\nOption (C) states that biofuel can single-handedly end CO2 production. This is not true because while biofuels can help reduce CO2 emissions, they alone cannot completely eliminate CO2 production. Other efforts, such as renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures, are needed to achieve significant reductions in CO2 emissions.\n\nOption (D) states that biofuel is perfect for the environment. This is also not true because while biofuels have environmental benefits compared to fossil fuels, they are not without their challenges. Issues such as land use change, competition with food production, and potential increase in water usage need to be carefully managed.\n\nTherefore, the only true statement is option (A), which correctly acknowledges that biofuel releases CO2 but is considered better for the environment than oil."
