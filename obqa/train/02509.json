Sleeping for nine hours allows for proper rest and recovery, which can contribute to a higher quality of life. Option (A) states that a doctor sleeps six hours daily, which is still adequate but less than the nurse. Option (C) states that a student sleeps two hours daily, which is significantly less than the recommended amount and can have negative effects on various aspects of life, such as concentration, learning, and overall health. Option (D) states that a teacher sleeps five hours daily, which is also less than the recommended amount and may lead to decreased energy and productivity throughout the day. Therefore, option (B) is the most optimal choice for individuals with the best quality of life in terms of sleep duration."
