The building of a hotel typically involves clearing land and disrupting habitats, which can lead to the destruction of many species. Option (A) is incorrect because acclimation refers to the process of adjusting to a new environment, which may or may not happen depending on the species. Option (B) is unrelated to the negative impact of construction on biodiversity. Option (C) is not necessarily true and depends on the intentions and actions of the hotel builders, but generally, construction does not involve purposely hunting species. Option (D) is the most accurate answer as it reflects the negative consequences that often occur when construction disrupts natural habitats."
