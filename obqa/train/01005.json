At high elevations, water is more likely to flow downhill and away, reducing the risk of flooding. However, at low elevations, water will naturally accumulate and have a higher chance of causing flooding. Therefore, option (A) is correct as it states that water damage will be more apparent at low elevations. Option (B) is incorrect because flood damage will not decrease at low elevations. Option (C) is also incorrect because flooding will actually be more of a risk at low elevations. Finally, option (D) is unrelated to the question as it mentions nothing about the cleanliness of floodwater."
