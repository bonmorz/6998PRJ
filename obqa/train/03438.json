Animals need water to survive, so if there is less to drink, they will likely have less access to water. Option (A) is incorrect because if the park is becoming more arid, it is likely that the available resources are diminishing, which would not support an increase in the animal population. Option (B) is incorrect because in an arid environment, there would likely be less food available as well. Option (D) is not related to the environmental conditions and is unrelated to the behavior of animals in an arid park."
