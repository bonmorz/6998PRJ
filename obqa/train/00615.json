Predators typically live near their future prey in the same environment. This allows them to have easier access to food and increases their chances of capturing their prey. Option (B) is not always true because predators can obtain water from various sources and it is not necessarily a requirement for them to live near it. Option (C) is incorrect because predators do not typically live near their offspring, as they often leave their young in separate areas or nests. Option (D) is sometimes true, as some predators may have dens or shelter in their environment, but it is not always the case. The main factor that determines where predators live is the availability of their prey."

They can travel to different locations to drink water. \n\nOption (C) is incorrect because predators do not typically live near their offspring. Predators often abandon their offspring once they are old enough to fend for themselves. \n\nOption (D) is incorrect because predators do not always live in dens.
