When a storm moves over the earth, it typically drops more rain on areas with vegetation, such as meadows. This is because vegetation creates moisture and helps to condense the water vapor in the air, leading to more precipitation. Option (B) is incorrect because sandy areas do not usually have much vegetation, so they do not receive as much rainfall. Option (C) is incorrect because the arctic is typically cold and covered in ice, so there is less opportunity for rain. Option (D) is incorrect because deserts are known for their lack of rainfall."

Meadows, which are flat areas covered with grass and other vegetation, are generally able to accumulate and retain water better than other areas. Sandy areas, like deserts, tend to have low water retention capabilities and may not receive as much rain. The arctic is a cold region covered in ice and snow, so it is unlikely to receive significant amounts of rain. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely choice.

Storms typically form when warm air rises into cooler regions and condenses into clouds. As the air rises, it cools and releases moisture, leading to precipitation in the form of rain. \n\nA meadow, which is typically an open area with vegetation, is more likely to receive more rain during a storm. This is because the presence of vegetation increases evaporation, which in turn increases humidity in the surrounding air. The higher humidity levels provide more moisture for the storm to pick up and release as rain. \n\nOption (B) is incorrect because a sandy area may not have enough vegetation to contribute to increased evaporation and humidity. Option (C) is also incorrect because the arctic region is often cold and has less moisture available for precipitation. Option (D) is incorrect because a desert usually has very little vegetation and experiences low evaporation rates, resulting in less moisture available for rainfall."
