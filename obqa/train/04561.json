Option (D), ice precipitation, is the correct answer because ice can freeze on the windshield and cause it to crack or shatter. When ice accumulates on a windshield, it adds weight and can create stress on the glass, leading to cracks. Options (A), condensation, and (C), clouds, do not directly cause cracks in windshields. Option (B), a gentle breeze, does not have enough force to crack a windshield."

Ice precipitation, such as hail or freezing rain, can cause cracks in windshields. When ice falls or forms on a windshield, it can create enough force and pressure to crack the glass.
