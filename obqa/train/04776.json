Desalination is the process of removing salt and other minerals from seawater to make it usable for drinking or irrigation purposes. This process typically involves the use of membranes or reverse osmosis to separate the salt from the water.\n\nWhile desalination can provide a source of freshwater for human use, it can have negative impacts on nearby fish and marine habitats. The process often involves the intake of seawater, and during this intake, fish and other marine organisms can be harmed or killed by being trapped or crushed. Additionally, the discharged brine or salt concentrate that is a byproduct of desalination can be harmful to marine life if not properly managed. The high salinity levels can negatively affect fish and other organisms that rely on specific salinity levels for survival.\n\nOptions (A), (B), and (C) are all incorrect because desalinating water from the ocean does not directly benefit nearby fish. Option (D) is the correct choice because the process of desalination can have a negative impact on fish habitats if not properly managed."
