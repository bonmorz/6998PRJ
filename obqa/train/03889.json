When an animal starts eating fewer calories than it is used to, it will eventually experience weight loss and its body may shrink. This is because the animal's body will start to utilize stored energy, such as fat reserves, to make up for the deficit in calories. Option (A) is incorrect because eating fewer calories does not cause an animal to float. Option (B) is incorrect because flying requires energy expenditure, not weight loss. Option (D) is incorrect because eating fewer calories would not cause an animal to get bigger."

When an animal starts eating fewer calories than it is used to, its body will eventually shrink. This is because the body needs a certain amount of energy to function properly, and if it does not receive enough calories, it will start to break down its stores of fat and muscle to obtain energy. As a result, the animal's body will become smaller. Option (A) is incorrect because floating is unrelated to calorie intake. Option (B) is incorrect because flying is a specific ability that not all animals have. Option (D) is incorrect because if an animal is eating fewer calories, it will not be able to gain weight and get bigger."
