Wheat is considered the first staple in the human diet because it was one of the first crops to be domesticated and cultivated by early civilizations in ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq). It played a crucial role in the development of settled agriculture and the rise of complex societies. Barley, corn, and rice were also important staple crops in different regions and time periods, but they were not the first staple in human diets."

Wheat was the first staple crop in the human diet, dating back to around 10,000 years ago during the transition to agriculture in the Fertile Crescent. Barley was also one of the earliest cultivated crops, but it was primarily used for brewing beer rather than as a staple food. Corn, or maize, was domesticated in Mesoamerica and became a major staple crop in the Americas, but it was not the first staple in the human diet. Rice was first cultivated in China around 9,000 years ago, but it was not the first staple. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) wheat."
