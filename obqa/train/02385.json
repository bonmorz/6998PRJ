This is a correct answer because tobacco is not edible and provides no nutritional value, while cocoa is not a staple crop and does not provide enough sustenance to sustain a population during a famine. \n\nOption (B) suggests corn and peas, but both corn and peas are staple crops that provide both carbohydrates and protein, making them valuable food sources during a famine. \n\nOption (C) suggests wheat and rice, which are both staple crops and provide essential nutrients, making them good choices to rely on during a famine. \n\nOption (D) suggests melon and beans. Melons are not very nutrient-dense and primarily consist of water, so they would not be a reliable crop during a famine. However, beans are a good source of protein and other nutrients, making them a valuable crop choice during a famine. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) tobacco and cocoa, as these crops do not provide sufficient sustenance during a famine."

This is the correct answer. \n\nExplanation: \n1. Tobacco does not provide any significant nutritional value. It is primarily grown for smoking and has no substantial benefits in terms of providing essential nutrients or sustenance.\n2. Cocoa, although it is used to make chocolate, is not a crop that provides a substantial amount of calories or nutrients. It is more commonly used for flavoring and in confectionery products, rather than as a primary food source. In a famine situation, where there is a lack of food, cocoa would not be a suitable crop to rely on.\n\nNow let us consider the other options: \n\nOption (B) suggests that corn and peas are crops that humans would likely avoid in a famine. This is incorrect. \n1. Corn is a staple crop in many parts of the world and provides a good source of carbohydrates and some essential nutrients. It can be used to make flour, cornmeal, or cornstarch, which can then be used to make various food products.\n2. Peas, while not as calorie-dense as other crops, are still a good source of protein, fiber, and various vitamins and minerals. They can provide essential nutrients in a famine situation.\n\nOption (C) states that wheat and rice would likely be avoided in a famine. This is incorrect. \n1. Wheat is a staple crop and is widely consumed in various forms, such as bread, pasta, and pastries. It is a good source of carbohydrates and some essential nutrients.\n2. Rice is another staple crop and is a primary food source for many communities around the world. It provides carbohydrates and is easily digestible, making it a suitable crop for sustaining populations during a famine.\n\nOption (D) suggests that melon and beans would likely be avoided in a famine. This is incorrect. \n1. While melons have high water content and are not as calorie-dense as some other crops, they still provide hydration and some essential vitamins and minerals.\n2. Beans, on the other hand, are an excellent source of plant-based protein, fiber, and various other essential nutrients. They would be beneficial in a famine situation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) tobacco and cocoa, as these two crops do not provide substantial nutritional value and would likely be avoided in a famine."
