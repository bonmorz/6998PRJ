A naval mine is an explosive device designed to destroy naval vessels. It can cause significant damage and potentially kill any organism in its vicinity. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.\n\nOption (B) suggests that a short drizzle is likeliest to harm an organism. However, a short drizzle is typically a light rain shower and does not pose any significant harm to organisms. It may even be beneficial for plants and animals.\n\nOption (C) states that eating a meal is likeliest to harm an organism. This is incorrect because eating a meal is a necessary process for organisms to obtain nutrition and sustain their health. While overeating or consuming unhealthy foods can have negative effects, in general, eating a meal is not harmful.\n\nOption (D) suggests that a light breeze is likeliest to harm an organism. A light breeze is generally not harmful and can even provide refreshing relief on a hot day. It may slightly affect small organisms or delicate structures, but it is unlikely to cause significant harm.\n\nBased on this assessment, option (A) - a naval mine - is the likeliest to harm an organism."

Eating a meal is a necessary activity for organisms to obtain nutrients and energy. While there may be instances where certain foods can be harmful (such as toxic or spoiled food), in general, eating a meal is not harmful.\n\nOption (D) is a light breeze.
