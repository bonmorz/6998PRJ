The question is asking about something that can change forms, and what might cause it to gain that ability. Option (C) is the best answer because temperature changes can cause certain substances to change from one form to another. For example, water can change from a solid (ice) to a liquid (water) to a gas (steam) depending on the temperature. Option (A) is unrelated to the concept of changing forms.
