Kickball is the correct answer because it is a sport in which players kick a large inflated ball with their feet to advance bases and score runs. Option (A) is incorrect because in baseball, players primarily use a bat to hit a ball, not their feet. Option (C) is incorrect because in golf, players use clubs to hit a small ball, not their feet. Option (D) is incorrect because hockey involves using a stick to hit a puck, not the foot."

A foot uses force on spheres in sports like kickball, where players kick the ball using their feet. This applies force to the ball to make it move. In baseball, the ball is thrown and hit with a bat, so the foot is not directly involved in applying force to the ball. In golf, the ball is struck with a golf club, not with the foot. In hockey, the ball (or puck) is typically pushed with a stick, not with the foot. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."
