Humans cry when they are born, horses can walk when they are born, and birds can chirp when born because of instinctive behavior. Instincts are innate behaviors that animals are born with, and they do not need to learn them from their parents or from watching TV (option A). While learning from their parents can play a role in animal behavior, the ability to cry, walk, or chirp is not dependent on this (option B). Option D, school, is not relevant to the question as it refers to a human learning institution and does not explain the behavior of animals when they are born. Therefore, option C, instinctive behavior, is the correct answer."
