Reproduction is the process by which an organism passes genetic information from itself to its offspring or younglings. Option (A) is incorrect because genetic information is not passed to the feet of an organism. Option (B) is unrelated to reproduction and refers to financial support for children. Option (C) is also incorrect because genetic information is not passed specifically to the brain, but rather to the entire offspring. Only option (D) is a correct and relevant answer."

Reproduction refers to the process by which organisms produce offspring. The term \"younglings\" refers to the offspring or young of an organism.

Option (A) is incorrect as genetic information is not passed to an organism's feet. Option (B) is not related to reproduction and is a term used in legal matters regarding financial support for children.
