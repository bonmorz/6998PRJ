This question requires knowledge about the cardiovascular system and the body's response to physical activity. During exercise, the body requires more oxygen and nutrients to be delivered to the muscles. To meet this demand, the heart beats faster and pumps more blood, resulting in an increased heart rate. Option (A) is incorrect because the heart rate does not remain the same during vigorous exercise. Option (C) is incorrect because the heart rate does not decrease. Option (D) is incorrect because the heart does not stop beating during exercise."
