Hawks are known to eat a variety of prey, but geckos are one of the common prey items for certain species of hawks. Option (A) is incorrect because although some hawks may eat eggs, it is not a general characteristic of their diet. Option (B) is incorrect because hawks do not typically prey on eagles.
