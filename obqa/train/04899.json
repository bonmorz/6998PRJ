Option (A) is incorrect because breath does not contain energy directly, but it can release energy through the process of respiration. Option (B) is incorrect because breath does not primarily consist of chemical substances, although there may be some trace chemicals present. Option (D) is incorrect because breath does not typically contain cells, as cells are the building blocks of living organisms and are not typically present in breath."
