In areas with low rainfall, plants that are adapted to desert environments are more likely to thrive. Cacti are well-suited for these conditions because they have developed special adaptations, such as long roots to reach water deep underground, and the ability to store water in their stems. Sunflowers, rose bushes, and palm trees are not typically adapted to low rainfall areas and would struggle to survive in such conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) cacti."
