They can detect the scent of food from a distance and follow it to the source. Option (B) is incorrect because neon signs are a human invention and not used by animals to find food. Option (C) is also incorrect as constellations have no relevance to the search for food by animals. Option (D) is partially correct as some animals use mating calls to attract mates, but it is unrelated to finding food sources."
