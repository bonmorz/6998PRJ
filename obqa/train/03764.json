Plants require sunlight for photosynthesis, which is the process that allows them to produce food and grow. If sunlight is not available, they can be provided with artificial light sources to simulate sunlight. Option (B) is the correct answer because a flashlight can emit a bright light that can mimic the intensity of sunlight. Option (A) is incorrect because love cannot provide the necessary light energy. Option (C) is incorrect because breathing does not generate light. Option (D) is incorrect because water is essential for plant growth but does not provide the necessary light energy."
