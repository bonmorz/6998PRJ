When the owner of the pony dies and the pony is unable to fend for itself, it dies because it does not have access to food (nutriment). Option (A) is incorrect because there is no mention of the pony being elderly. Option (B) is unlikely to be the cause of death as boredom does not directly cause death. Option (C) is a vague statement and not a direct cause of death. Option (D) is the correct answer because without proper nutrition, the pony cannot survive."
