When sound waves encounter an obstacle, such as a canyon wall, they will reflect off the surface, causing an echo. This phenomenon is known as sound reflection.

Option (C) is incorrect because sound waves can travel through water in the ocean, but they do not reflect off the surface of the water. Option (D) is incorrect because a vacuum does not contain any air or matter for sound waves to travel through, so they cannot reflect off any surfaces."
