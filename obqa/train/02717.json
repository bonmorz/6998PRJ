Option (C) is incorrect because power plants do not play a role in the growth of plants. Option (D) is incorrect because plant toys do not provide the necessary components for photosynthesis. Option (B) is the correct answer because local flora refers to the surrounding plant life, which can provide competition and resources necessary for growth."

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen. This process is essential for plant growth because glucose serves as the plant's source of energy, allowing it to carry out all its metabolic functions.\n\nOption (A) is partially correct because sunlight is needed for photosynthesis to occur. However, sunlight alone is not enough for plant growth; the plant also requires other essential nutrients and water.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because power plants are not involved in the process of photosynthesis. Power plants generate electricity for human use, but they do not contribute to plant growth.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because plant toys are not living organisms and do not require photosynthesis for growth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) local flora. Local flora refers to the native plant species found in a particular region. These plants rely on photosynthesis to grow and develop, using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce the energy and nutrients needed for their growth."
