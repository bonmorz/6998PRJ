Friction is a force that opposes motion, so if you wanted to slow down a subject, you would want to increase the friction acting upon it. Option (A) suggests embracing the subject, which would increase the friction due to the contact between your body and the subject. Option (B) suggests throwing the subject, which would not necessarily increase friction unless it encounters resistance in the air or upon landing. Option (C) suggests pushing the subject, which could increase or decrease friction depending on the surface and the direction of the push. Option (D) suggests rolling the subject, which would decrease friction because rolling reduces the surface area of contact between the subject and the ground, resulting in less friction."

By embracing or holding onto a subject, you are increasing the friction between you and the subject. This increased friction will cause the subject to slow down.
