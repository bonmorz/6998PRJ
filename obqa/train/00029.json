This reaction changes the composition and properties of the milk, resulting in a new substance. \n\nOption (A), flour added to salt, is a physical change, not a chemical change. Mixing flour and salt does not result in the formation of new substances; it only combines two separate substances without altering their chemical compositions.\n\nOption (B), milk added to water, is also a physical change. Mixing milk and water does not result in any chemical reactions or the formation of new substances. The milk and water can be easily separated without any chemical changes occurring.\n\nOption (C), corn added to soup, is a physical change as well. Adding corn to soup does not involve any chemical reactions. The corn retains its chemical composition and properties, and it can easily be removed from the soup without altering its chemical nature."
