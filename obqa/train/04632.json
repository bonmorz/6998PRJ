The high levels of sunlight in the Caribbean region result in increased exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In response to this UV radiation, the body produces more melanin, a pigment that gives color to the skin. Melanin helps to protect the skin from the harmful effects of UV radiation by absorbing and dispersing it. This is why individuals with darker skin tones have a higher natural sun protection factor (SPF) compared to those with lighter skin tones. Options (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect and not supported by scientific evidence. Unicorns, lack of nutrients, and camouflage are not factors that influence skin tone in humans."
