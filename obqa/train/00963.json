When light passes through a material, such as a diamond, it can change direction due to the change in speed. This phenomenon is known as refraction. \n\nWhen sunlight passes through a diamond, which has a high refractive index, the light is refracted and split into its constituent colors, creating a beautiful display of colors known as a rainbow. This occurs because each color of light has a different wavelength, and when the light enters the diamond, the different colors are bent at different angles due to their different wavelengths. As a result, the light spreads out into its individual colors.\n\nOption (A), shining a light at a mirror, is incorrect because a mirror does not cause this specific phenomenon. It reflects the light, but it does not split it into different colors. Option (B), letting sunlight hit a broken mirror, is also incorrect because a broken mirror does not have any specific effect on the splitting of light. Option (D), shining a flashlight at broken glass on the floor, is similarly incorrect because broken glass does not have the same refractive properties as a diamond.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option (C), setting a diamond outside on a bright day, as diamonds have a high refractive index and can cause sunlight to split into different colors due to refraction."
