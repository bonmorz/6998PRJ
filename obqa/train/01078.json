This is because shorter showers require less water to be heated and used, reducing overall water usage. Option (A) is incorrect because taking shorter showers actually decreases water usage. Option (C) is also incorrect because it suggests an increase in water consumption, which is the opposite of what happens with shorter showers. Option (D) is unrelated to water usage and refers to the potential strain on a water heater, which is not relevant to the question."
