Electric cars run on electricity, so they can receive energy at a power outlet, an electric station, or a charging station. However, they will have difficulty receiving energy at a gasoline station because gasoline stations are designed to provide fuel for traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, not electricity for electric cars. Option (D) is incorrect because gasoline is not a suitable energy source for electric cars."
