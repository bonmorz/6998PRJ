Option (C) - dumpyards, also known as landfills or garbage dumps, have a negative impact on the environment. Landfills are places where waste is disposed of, often resulting in pollution of groundwater, soil, and air. They can emit methane gas, a potent greenhouse gas, and toxins that can harm both human and animal health. Options (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect because plants, recycling plants, and oceans do not have a negative impact on the environment. In fact, plants play a vital role in oxygen production and carbon dioxide absorption, recycling plants promote eco-friendly waste management, and oceans serve as a vital ecosystem."

They help to reduce waste and conserve resources by processing and reusing materials.\n\nOption (C) - Dumpyards: Dumpyards, also known as landfills, have a significant negative impact on the environment. This is because landfills are often poorly managed and can result in pollution of soil, water, and air. They contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and can contaminate nearby ecosystems.\n\nOption (D) - Oceans: While oceans can be impacted by pollution and human activities such as overfishing, they are not inherently negative for the environment. Oceans are crucial for maintaining biodiversity and regulating the Earth's climate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) dumpyards, as they can have a negative impact on the environment."
