When a place becomes chilly, animals may experience cooler temperatures and as a response to this, their bodies may retain more water to prevent dehydration. Sweating (option A) is the body's response to overheating and losing heat, not appropriate for a chilly environment. Losing more water (option B) and needing more hydration (option C) would be more relevant to a hotter environment, as water loss through sweat and increased water intake would be necessary to cool down the body. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer for a chilly environment."
