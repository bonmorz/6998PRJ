Among the options given, only option (C) \"apes\" falls under the category of animals that bears may consume. Option (A) \"plants\" is partially correct but doesn't encompass the full range of bear diet. Option (B) \"eukaryotes\" is a broad category that includes many different types of organisms, so it is not specific enough to be the correct answer. Option (D) \"amoebas\" is incorrect because amoebas are single-celled organisms and not a likely food source for bears."
