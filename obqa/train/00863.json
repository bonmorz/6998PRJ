Pollination is the process by which pollen from the male part of a flower is transferred to the female part of the flower, resulting in fertilization and the production of seeds. This process is crucial for the reproduction of many plants, including crops.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because although flowers rely on pollination for reproduction, the question specifically asks about a percentage. Option (B) is incorrect because people do not directly depend on pollination for anything. Option (D) is incorrect because while bees are important pollinators, the question asks about the percentage of something that depends on pollination, not the percentage of something that is responsible for pollination.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) crops. Pollination is essential for the production of fruits, vegetables, and grains. Without proper pollination, the yields of these crops would be significantly reduced, impacting food production and supply. Approximately 35 percent of crops depend on pollination to ensure successful reproduction and harvest."
