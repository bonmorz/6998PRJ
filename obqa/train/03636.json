Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and certain types of algae and bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. These organisms, collectively known as flora, have specialized cells called chloroplasts that contain the pigment chlorophyll, which is responsible for capturing sunlight during photosynthesis. Option (A) is incorrect because animals do not have the ability to perform photosynthesis. Option (B) is incorrect because inorganic minerals do not have cells. Option (D) is a general term for various small animals and does not specify any particular type of organism capable of photosynthesis."
