Option (B) is the correct answer because natural geological processes, such as erosion, weathering, and volcanic activity, can form geological features like mountains, valleys, caves, and canyons. These features are made up of lifeless matter, such as rocks and minerals. Option (A) is incorrect because animals are living organisms, not geological formations. Option (C) is incorrect because air flow is not formed by geological processes, but rather by atmospheric conditions and weather patterns. Option (D) is incorrect because companies are not formed by geological processes, but rather by human activities and organizational structures."

Natural geological processes refer to the forces that shape the Earth's surface, such as tectonic activity, erosion, and weathering. These processes are responsible for the formation of geological features like mountains, valleys, caves, and rocks. These features are considered lifeless matter as they do not possess biological functions or characteristics. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because animals are not formed by geological processes but rather through biological reproduction and development. Option (C) is incorrect because air flow is not a geological feature but a result of atmospheric conditions and weather patterns. Option (D) is incorrect because companies are not formed through geological processes, but through human organization and economic activities."
