Thermal energy insulators are materials that have low thermal conductivity, meaning they do not conduct heat well. Similarly, good electrical insulators are materials that have high electrical resistance, meaning they do not conduct electricity well. The rubber sandwiched between two iron slabs is a good example because rubber is both a good thermal insulator and a good electrical insulator. Option (A) is incorrect because metallic rocks on the ground are good thermal conductors, but not necessarily good electrical insulators. Option (B) is incorrect because a fan on the ceiling is not necessarily a good thermal or electrical insulator. Option (D) is incorrect because metal knives for sale are usually good thermal conductors and not good electrical insulators."
