When the digestive system is working, it is involved in breaking down food into smaller particles and dismantling nutrients. Option (A) is incorrect because the fact that the digestive system is working does not mean it is bad to eat. Option (C) is incorrect because food being cleared out refers to the process of elimination, which happens after digestion. Option (D) is not related to the functioning of the digestive system, as it is a time for eating rather than a description of the system's function."
