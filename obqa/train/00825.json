When rain pours on a road and freezes overnight, the temperature causes the water to expand as it turns into ice. This expansion exerts pressure on the road surface and can cause cracks to form. Option (A) is correct because freezing rain can lead to cracking in roads. Option (B) is incorrect because freezing rain does not cause the road to swell.
