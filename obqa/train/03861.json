As the man drives away from his dog, the distance between them is increasing. In a rearview mirror, objects that are further away appear smaller, which is why the dog progressively appears smaller.

When the man drives away from his dog, the distance between them is increasing. This means that the dog is getting smaller in the rear-view mirror because it is moving further away from the mirror and the observer. Option (A) is incorrect because evaporating refers to a substance changing from a liquid to a gas, which is not relevant in this scenario. Option (B) is incorrect because the question states that the dog is progressively getting smaller, indicating that the distance is increasing. Option (C) is also incorrect for the same reason. Option (D) is the correct answer because the distance between the man and the dog is increasing as the man drives away."
