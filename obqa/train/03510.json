Earthquakes typically last for a very short duration, usually a matter of seconds or minutes. However, even within that short duration, they can cause significant devastation to buildings, infrastructure, and human lives. Option (A) and Option (C) suggest longer durations for earthquakes, which is incorrect. Option (D) suggests a shorter duration than Option (B), which is also incorrect. Therefore, Option (B) is the correct answer as it accurately reflects the short duration of earthquakes and their potential for devastation."
