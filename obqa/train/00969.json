During the night, temperatures in the desert can drop significantly, causing animals to feel cold. As a result, they may shiver in order to generate heat and maintain their body temperature. Option (A) is incorrect because running is not a direct response to nighttime in the desert. Option (B) is also incorrect because jumping is not a typical behavior associated with the effects of nighttime. Option (C) is partially correct, as animals may indeed get thirsty in the desert, but this is not specifically caused by nighttime."

During nighttime in the desert, temperatures can drop significantly due to the lack of sunlight and heat-absorbing materials like vegetation and water. This can lead to cold temperatures that may cause animals to shiver, as shivering is a response to help generate body heat and maintain their core temperature.\n\nOption (A), \"run,\" is not necessarily related to nighttime in the desert as animals may run for various reasons and not specifically due to the time of day. Option (B), \"jump,\" is also unrelated to nighttime in the desert and may vary depending on the behavior and characteristics of the specific animal. Option (C), \"get thirsty,\" is an incorrect answer because nighttime in the desert does not directly cause animals to become thirsty; thirst is generally a result of the lack of water availability in the desert environment, regardless of the time of day."
