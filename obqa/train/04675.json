Chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis, which is the process of converting sunlight into energy for the plant. The flatter the surface of the tree part containing chloroplasts, the more surface area is available for sunlight absorption. More surface area means more chloroplasts and more efficient photosynthesis, resulting in increased absorption of light and energy. Option (A) is incorrect because the shape of the chloroplasts does not directly affect their color. Option (C) is unrelated to the function of chloroplasts. Option (D) is a distractor and not related to the topic."
