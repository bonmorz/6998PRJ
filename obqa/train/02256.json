Therefore, it is not the correct answer.\n\nOption (C) driving is the correct answer. When we drive vehicles that run on fossil fuels, such as gasoline or diesel, they emit carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and other pollutants into the air. These emissions contribute to air pollution and have a negative impact on the environment. Therefore, driving causes the most pollution compared to the other options.\n\nOption (D) walking does not cause any emissions, as it is solely powered by human locomotion.
