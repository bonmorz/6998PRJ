We know that the Earth takes approximately 24 hours to complete one full rotation, so option (A) is incorrect since it would require 48 hours for two days to pass. Option (B) is also incorrect since it would require 7 days for a week to go by. Option (C) is incorrect because the Earth's rotation does not need to slow down in order to complete one cycle. Therefore, the correct answer is option (D), which states that a seventh of a week must pass. Since there are 7 days in a week, a seventh of a week is equivalent to one day, which aligns with the time it takes for the Earth to complete one rotation."
