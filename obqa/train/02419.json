Erosion refers to the process of wearing away and carrying away soil, rocks, and other materials from the Earth's surface. The most significant factor in causing erosion is the force of water.\n\nIn this question, a babbling brook refers to a small and gentle flowing stream, which may contribute to some erosion but not as much as a larger body of water. Option (A) is less likely to cause significant erosion compared to the other options.\n\nA stagnant pond, on the other hand, does not have any significant flowing water, so it is unlikely to cause much erosion. Option (C) is less likely to cause erosion compared to the other options.\n\nA light breeze is a movement of air but does not have the force of water. While wind erosion is a real phenomenon, it is generally not as significant as water erosion. Option (D) is less likely to cause erosion compared to the other options.\n\nA mighty river, however, has a strong and continuous flow of water, which can exert a significant force on the soil and rocks it encounters. Over time, this can lead to substantial erosion. Option (B) is the most likely to cause the most erosion out of the given options.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) a mighty river."
