Chemical splashing in an experiment can be dangerous, messy, and sometimes even playful, depending on the context. However, in the context of laboratory safety, the answer is that it can be safe. Proper lab protocols, such as wearing protective clothing and eyewear, using appropriate containment measures, and following correct handling procedures, can minimize or prevent the dangers associated with chemical splashing. Option (A) is incorrect because without proper precautions, chemical splashing can indeed be dangerous. Option (C) is partially correct because chemical splashing can be messy, but this is not the main focus or concern when discussing safety. Option (D) is incorrect because while there may be playful aspects to certain experiments, it is not the main consideration when discussing chemical splashing and laboratory safety."
