This is why highly polished surfaces appear shiny. Option (A) is incorrect because an absorbent material would not have a highly polished surface. Option (C) is incorrect because shadows are formed when light is blocked by an object, not attracted to it. Option (D) is incorrect because shattering is not a property of a highly polished surface, but rather a result of extreme force or pressure."
