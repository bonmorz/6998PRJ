The hours of light and dark being equal is typically a sign that the equinox has occurred, which marks the transition from summer to fall.

Option (B) states that it will be around thirteen weeks or so, which aligns with the timeframe between the equinox and the arrival of winter. Option (A) is incorrect because it suggests a duration of just over a year, which is too long. Option (C) is a play on words referencing George R.R. Martin and his book series \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" (which inspired the TV show \"Game of Thrones\"), and is not related to the changing seasons. Option (D) references Groundhog Day, which occurs in February and is traditionally believed to predict the arrival of spring, not winter. Therefore, Option (B) is the correct answer."

Given that it has been twelve weeks since the person put on shorts, and they notice the hours of light and dark are equal, it suggests that they are experiencing the fall equinox. If the fall equinox has just occurred and the person is looking for how long until winter, it would be roughly thirteen weeks or so.
