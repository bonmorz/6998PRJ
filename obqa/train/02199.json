Option (C) is the correct answer because to make food ready for human consumption, we typically need to cook it. Cooking involves applying heat to the food, often using a stove, to create chemical reactions that break down proteins, carbohydrates, and other molecules, making the food easier to digest and safer to eat. Option (A) is incorrect because throwing food into the ocean does not make it ready for consumption. Option (B) is incorrect because stomping on food with your feet would likely contaminate it and make it unsafe to eat. Option (D) is unrelated to food preparation and not a step in making food ready for human consumption."
