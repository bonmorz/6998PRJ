During this process, water evaporates from bodies of water such as lakes and forms clouds, which eventually precipitate and return to the Earth as rain or snow. Option (C) indicates the formation of a cloud from a lake, which is part of the water cycle. Option (A) refers to a physical change of state in water, but it does not specifically relate to the water cycle. Option (B) is the result of human activity and not a natural process in the water cycle. Option (D) is also a human activity and does not describe a natural process in the water cycle."
