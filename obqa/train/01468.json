Geese, along with many other migrating animals, use the Earth's magnetic patterns to navigate and find their way. They have the ability to sense the Earth's magnetic field and use it as a compass to guide their migration. Option (A) is incorrect because there is no mention of \"World's great patterns\" being used by geese to navigate. Option (C) is incorrect because the goose does not have a map initially. Option (D) is incorrect because while a compass points north, it does not provide the specific information needed for the goose to find its way to warmer states."
