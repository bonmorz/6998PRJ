Eagles are carnivorous birds, and they primarily hunt and feed on small mammals like rodents. Option (A) is incorrect because eagles do not eat beans. Option (B) is plausible because eagles also eat fish, but it is not the main source of their nutrients. Option (C) is incorrect because deer are too large for eagles to hunt and catch. Option (D) is the correct answer because eagles frequently hunt and feed on rodents for their nutrients."
