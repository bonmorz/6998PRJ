Malnourishment refers to a lack of proper nutrition, which can result from an inadequate intake of essential nutrients. Option (A) states that the hamster was malnourished because there was a depletion in the corn supply. This implies that the hamster did not have access to enough corn, which is likely a key component of its diet. \n\nOptions (B), (C), and (D) do not provide valid reasons for the hamster being malnourished. Option (B) suggests that the hamster intentionally went on a hunger strike, but hunger strikes are typically a conscious and deliberate act done by individuals for specific reasons, which is unlikely in the case of a hamster. Option (C) suggests mouth paralysis, which would prevent normal eating, but this is not a common cause of malnutrition in hamsters. Option (D) implies that the hamster was waiting for a key to access its food, but this is not a valid reason for malnourishment and lacks biological plausibility.\n\nTherefore, the most likely reason for the hamster being malnourished is the depletion in the corn supply, as stated in option (A)."
