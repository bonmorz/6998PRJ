A microscope is a scientific instrument used to view objects that are too small to be seen by the naked eye. Option (D) is the correct answer because a microscope is commonly used to study and observe microscopic organisms and structures in sea life. Option (A) is incorrect because giraffes are much larger than the magnification capabilities of a microscope. Options (B) and (C) are also incorrect because trees and butterflies can be observed without the need for a microscope."
