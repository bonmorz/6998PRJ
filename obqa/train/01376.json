Carnivores are animals that primarily eat other animals, while omnivores are animals that eat both plants and animals. Since carnivores devour omnivores, it implies that they eat animals that also eat plants. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) flora, which refers to plants. \n\nOption (B) rocks is incorrect because rocks are not consumed as a food source by any animal. Option (C) crustaceans refers to a specific group of animals and is not a general category of animals, so it does not accurately reflect what omnivores eat. Option (D) sand is also incorrect because sand is not consumed as a food source by either carnivores or omnivores."
