When salt is added to a solid, it typically functions as a desiccant, meaning it absorbs moisture and reduces the humidity around the solid. This can affect the hardening process of certain substances, such as concrete, by decreasing the energy or heat needed for the solid to harden. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the addition of salt does not have a direct impact on the light emitted by a solid. Option (B) is also incorrect because salt does not affect the sound emitted by a solid. Option (D) is unrelated to the effects of salt on solids."
