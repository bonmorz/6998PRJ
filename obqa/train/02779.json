During photosynthesis, plants produce sugar as a source of energy for themselves. This sugar provides the plants with sustenance, allowing them to grow, develop, and carry out essential life processes. Option (A) is incorrect because plants do not produce sugar to support \"babies\" in the way that humans do. Option (B) is incorrect because love handles are a term for excess fat, which is not related to the production of sugar in plants. Option (C) is incorrect because the term \"belly\" does not accurately describe the purpose of the sugar produced during photosynthesis."
