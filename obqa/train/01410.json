When heavy rains occur in a particular location over a long period of time, the water from the small creek can accumulate and contribute to the formation of a rushing river. In addition to the larger water source, there can also be greater amounts of sediment and debris carried by the water, which can lead to the formation of a deeper and wider river channel. Option (A) is incorrect because rock fights are unrelated to the formation of rivers. Option (C) and (D) are not related to the situation described in the question. Option (B) is the correct answer because the presence of a larger water source can support the existence of larger animal populations, such as sheep herds, due to the availability of water for drinking and grazing."
