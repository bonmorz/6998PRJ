Metals are considered nonrenewable resources because they are finite and can be depleted. Recycling metals helps to reduce the need for mining new ores, conserves natural resources, and reduces the environmental impact associated with metal production. Option (A) is incorrect because the danger of producing metals is not the primary reason for recycling them. Options (C) and (D) are partially true, as mining can be challenging and metals can be expensive, but they do not capture the main reason for recycling metals, which is their nonrenewable nature."
