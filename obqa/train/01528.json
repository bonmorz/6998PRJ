Option (A) is the correct answer because puppies often learn through observation and imitation. If the puppy's mother went through the doggy door, the puppy would likely observe her and learn how to do it. Option (B) is incorrect because puppies are not capable of reading. Option (C) is also incorrect because puppies do not attend school. Option (D) is possible, but unlikely, as puppies do not typically have the cognitive ability to make complex plans."
