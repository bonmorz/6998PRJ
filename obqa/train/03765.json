Organic manure is typically made from natural materials that can decompose and provide nutrients to plants. Option (C), a family of raccoons, is not a material and therefore does not make sense in the context of the question. Options (A) and (B) both mention plastic, which is not organic and does not decompose in the same way as natural materials. Option (D), a plastic water bottle, is also not organic and cannot be used as manure. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) as it is the only option that refers to a natural material that can decompose and contribute to the organic matter in soil."
