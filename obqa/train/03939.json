If more people choose to bike instead of drive cars, it will reduce air pollution since bikes do not emit harmful gases like cars do. Consequently, it will be easier to breathe and the air quality will improve. Option (A) is incorrect because if more people bike instead of drive, there will be less demand for cars, not more. Option (B) is unrelated to the question and not a direct result of more people biking. Option (D) is also incorrect because the question specifically asks what will happen if more people bike, so the assumption is that more people will indeed ride bikes."
