Animal competition refers to the struggle between individuals or species for resources such as food, mates, or territory. Option (A) is the correct answer because it describes competition between wolves and bears for the same resource - salmon. Option (B) describes fast swimming, which could be a form of competition, but it does not specifically involve two different species competing for resources. Option (C) describes two different species living in the same habitat, but it does not specify any competition between them. Option (D) describes a symbiotic relationship between an oxpecker bird and a rhino, where the bird helps remove parasites from the rhino's skin, which is not a clear example of competition."
