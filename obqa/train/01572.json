When a rock from deep down in the Earth's crust becomes less hot, it undergoes a process called cooling and solidification. As it cools, the minerals in the rock start to crystallize and form solid structures. Therefore, the correct answer is option (C) minerals. Option (A) is incorrect because vitamins are organic compounds found in living organisms, not rocks. Option (B) is not directly related to the cooling process of rocks, as cracks can occur due to various factors. Option (D) is also not directly related to the cooling process of rocks, as holes can form in rocks through weathering and erosion."

Option (A) is incorrect because vitamins are organic compounds found in living organisms, not created by rock formation. Option (B) is partially correct, as cooling and solidifying of rock can sometimes result in cracks, but it is not the main outcome. Option (D) is incorrect because holes are not typically formed as a result of rock cooling and solidifying."

When rocks from deep down in the Earth become less hot, they undergo processes such as cooling and solidification. As they cool, they can form minerals through various chemical reactions.
