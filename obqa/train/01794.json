A flood plain is a flat, low-lying area adjacent to a river or stream that is periodically flooded. This allows for the deposition of sediment, creating fertile soil for agriculture. Option (A) is incorrect because a large salt-water ocean is not a level area near a steady flow of water. Option (B) is incorrect because a mountain peak is a high point, not a level area. Option (C) is incorrect because a fjord is a narrow, deep inlet of the sea surrounded by steep cliffs, not a level area."
