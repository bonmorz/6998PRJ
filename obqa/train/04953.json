Brewer's yeast, option (A), is a unicellular organism that can survive and function without the help of other cells. It has all the necessary cellular components to carry out vital functions such as metabolism, reproduction, and response to stimuli. Options (B) air, (C) sand, and (D) sugar are all non-living entities and do not exhibit cellular structure or function, therefore they cannot survive without the help of other cells."
