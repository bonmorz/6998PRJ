After a wildfire, many plants and animals may have been killed or their habitats destroyed. The surviving creatures will need to find new homes in order to survive and establish themselves in the altered landscape. Option (B) is incorrect because the question does not specifically mention food as a concern for the surviving creatures. Option (C) is not explicitly mentioned in the question and cannot be assumed to be a priority for the surviving creatures. Option (D) is also not mentioned in the question and cannot be assumed to be a necessary action for the surviving creatures."
