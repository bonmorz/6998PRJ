After a long, hard workout, professionals often consume protein to aid in muscle recovery. Protein provides the building blocks necessary for repairing and building muscle tissue. Option (A) is also a valid choice as electrolytes, which include sodium, potassium, and magnesium, are important for hydration and muscle function. However, protein is specifically mentioned as the preferred choice for muscle healing. Option (C) is incorrect as consuming sugar after a workout does not directly aid in muscle recovery. Option (D) is somewhat related as carbohydrates are important for replenishing glycogen stores in the muscles, but protein is a more targeted choice for muscle repair."

Option (C) is not optimal because sugar does not provide the necessary nutrients for muscle repair. Option (D) is also not as ideal as protein because while carbohydrates are important for energy replenishment after a workout, they do not directly aid in muscle recovery."
