Weathering is the process by which rocks and other surfaces are broken down and worn away by natural elements such as wind, water, and temperature changes. This process can lead to the formation of holes and depressions in pathways and other surfaces. Option (A) is incorrect because the construction of submarines is unrelated to weathering. Option (B) is unrelated as well, as weathering does not directly relate to bike racing. Option (D) is also unrelated, as the height of houses is not influenced by weathering."
