Typically, birds construct their nests using various materials such as sticks, twigs, grass, and leaves. Option (A) is the correct answer because sticks are commonly used by many bird species to create a safe and stable structure for their eggs. Option (B) is incorrect because gum is not a material used by birds for nest construction. Option (C) is also incorrect because although some birds may use small rocks in their nests for additional stability, they are not the primary material used. Option (D) is incorrect because tape is not a natural material and is not used by birds for nest construction."
