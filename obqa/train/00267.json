Using a metal kitchen tool, such as a grater or a knife, on a block of cheese will create small pieces of cheese. Metal tools are typically used to cut or grate cheese, resulting in it being broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Option (A) is incorrect because using a metal tool on cheese does not create milk. Option (B) is incorrect because using a metal tool on cheese does not create blue cheese - blue cheese is a specific type of cheese that is made through a different process. Option (C) is incorrect because using a metal tool on cheese does not immediately melt it - melting requires heat."
