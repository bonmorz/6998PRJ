Crop rotation refers to the practice of growing different crops in the same field in successive seasons. By switching crops on a continual basis, farmers can reduce the risk of pests and diseases that may specifically target certain crops. Additionally, different crops have different nutrient requirements, and by rotating crops, farmers can prevent the depletion of specific nutrients from the soil. This ensures that the soil remains fertile and provides crops with a balanced supply of essential nutrients, including vitamins.

The correct answer is (D) - crops need to be switched on a continual basis for more wanted vitamins.\n\nExplanation: Crop rotation is important because different crops have different nutrient requirements. By switching crops, the nutrients in the soil are replenished and balanced. Each crop takes up specific nutrients from the soil, and constantly planting the same crop can deplete those nutrients. By rotating crops, farmers can ensure that the soil remains fertile and provides the necessary vitamins and minerals for healthy plant growth.\n\nOption (A) - the animal habitats - is incorrect because crop rotation is not primarily done for the benefit of animal habitats. While crop rotation can have positive effects on the overall ecosystem, the primary focus is on maintaining soil health and crop productivity.\n\nOption (B) - for more pests - is also incorrect. Crop rotation can actually help reduce pest problems. Different pests prefer different crops, so by rotating crops, farmers can disrupt the life cycles of pests, making it harder for them to establish and thrive. This can help reduce pest populations and the need for pesticides.\n\nOption (C) - bees and birds - is not directly related to the need for crop rotation. While crop rotation can have indirect positive effects on pollinators like bees and birds by supporting a diverse ecosystem, this is not the main reason for rotating crops.\n\nOverall, the correct answer is (D) because crop rotation is necessary to maintain soil fertility and ensure that crops receive a balanced and adequate supply of essential vitamins and minerals."
