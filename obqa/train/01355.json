According to Newton's first law of motion, an object in motion will continue moving at a constant speed and direction unless acted upon by an external force. When a force acts on an object in the opposite direction that it is moving, it causes the object's speed to decrease. This is commonly referred to as \"braking\" in the context of motion. Option (A) is the correct answer because it describes the motion of an object moving forward. Options (B), (C), and (D) describe different directions of motion but are not related to the concept of an object's speed decreasing due to an opposing force."
