Skin is a common body covering for animals, but in the context of the question, it is not specific enough to be the correct answer. Scales are typically found on reptiles, not animals that cluck. Fur is a body covering for mammals, but chickens do not have fur. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) feathers."
