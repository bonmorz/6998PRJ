We know that a hundred bees swarm a pink rose and a dozen bees swarm a yellow lily. Bees play a crucial role in pollination, which leads to the production of offspring for plants. Since there are more bees swarming the pink rose, it is likely to have more pollination and therefore more offspring than the yellow lily. Option (A) correctly states that the rose will have more offspring. Option (B) is incorrect because the number of bees does not determine whether the lily will be lifted from the ground. Option (D) is incorrect because there is no indication that the lily will be consumed and wilt. Thus, the correct answer is (C) - the lily will have fewer offspring than the rose."

Bees are important pollinators and their activity helps in fertilizing flowers and enabling them to produce offspring (seeds or fruits). When a larger number of bees visit a flower, there is a higher chance of successful pollination and therefore, more offspring being produced.\n\nIn this scenario, if a hundred bees swarm a pink rose and only a dozen bees swarm a yellow lily, it is likely that the pink rose will have more offspring. The larger number of bees visiting the rose increases the chances of successful pollination and seed production.\n\nSo, option (A) is incorrect because the rose is expected to have more offspring than the lily. Option (B) is incorrect because the number of bees swarming a flower doesn't have any impact on the weight or lifting force on the flower. Option (D) is incorrect because being consumed and wilting has no correlation with the number of bees swarming a flower.\n\nTherefore, option (C) is the correct answer, as the yellow lily is expected to have fewer offspring than the pink rose due to the smaller number of bees visiting it."
