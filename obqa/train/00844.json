This increased movement leads to the water evaporating more quickly, causing it to lose volume as moisture is pulled into the air. Option (A) is incorrect because if heat is added, the water will not maintain its exact volume. Option (B) is also incorrect because although water levels in a container may rise as it expands when heated, this is not the result of moisture being held in the water. Option (C) is incorrect because boiling occurs at a specific temperature and is not solely dependent on the addition of heat."
