Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and other aspects of the Earth's climate. It is primarily caused by the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily from human activities.\n\nOption (A) Earth Day is the correct answer because it represents a global initiative to bring awareness to environmental issues and promote sustainable practices. Earth Day is celebrated on April 22nd each year and encourages individuals and communities to take actions that can lessen the impact of climate change. This can include activities such as planting trees, promoting renewable energy sources, reducing waste, and advocating for policy changes to address environmental issues.\n\nOptions (B), (C), and (D) - hurricanes, tsunamis, and wildfires - are all natural disasters that can be influenced by climate change but are not actions that can actively lessen its impact. While climate change can potentially increase the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events like hurricanes and wildfires, these events themselves do not directly address the root causes or mitigate the impact of climate change.\n\nTherefore, the most effective action to lessen the impact of climate change would be participating in initiatives like Earth Day that raise awareness and promote actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, conserve resources, and protect the environment."
