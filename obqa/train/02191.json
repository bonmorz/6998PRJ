Talc is a mineral commonly found in talc deposits, and it is not related to the growth of strawberries or the stomachs of sharks. Therefore, option (A) and option (C) can be eliminated.\n\nThe question states that the area of dirt contains large amounts of talc. This suggests that talc is present in the soil or rocks in that specific area. This does not imply that talc can be found in underwater caves in France, so option (D) can also be eliminated.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B) - talc can be found in strawberries that grow in the area with the dirt containing large amounts of talc. This is because the roots of the strawberry plants absorb nutrients and minerals from the soil, including talc if it is present in the soil."
