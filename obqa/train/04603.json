Inherited traits are those that are passed down from parents to offspring through genes, while acquired traits are those that are acquired or learned during an individual's lifetime.\n\nOption (A), wealth, is typically acquired and not inherited. While individuals may inherit money or assets from their parents, wealth itself is not a genetic trait.\n\nOption (B), height, is predominantly determined by a combination of genetic factors. While nutrition and other environmental factors can influence growth and development, the potential for height is largely determined by an individual's genes.\n\nOption (C), prison time served, is not inherited. It is an acquired trait that results from an individual's actions and interactions with the legal system.\n\nOption (D), wisdom, is not solely inherited. While certain personality traits and cognitive abilities may have a genetic component, wisdom is often acquired through life experiences, learning, and personal growth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) height, as it is predominantly an inherited trait."
