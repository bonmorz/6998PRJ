Competition among lions is fierce when the antelopes, which are their prey, are scarce or in low numbers. Lions rely on hunting antelopes to obtain food, so when there are fewer antelopes available, lions have to compete for the limited resources. Option (A) is incorrect because the presence of new prey species may actually alleviate competition among lions, as they now have additional food sources. Option (B) is incorrect because a decrease in the lion population would likely decrease competition, not increase it. Option (C) is incorrect because having a plethora of prey choices may also reduce competition among lions, as there is more prey available for each individual."
