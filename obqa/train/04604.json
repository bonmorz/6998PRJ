Option (B) is incorrect because vaccination at an early age actually reduces the risk of getting smallpox. Option (C) is incorrect because it is essentially the same as option (B), just rephrased.

Smallpox is a highly contagious and potentially deadly disease caused by the variola virus. The primary mode of transmission is through respiratory droplets from infected individuals. \n\nOption (B) and (C) are incorrect because vaccination is actually one of the most effective ways to prevent smallpox. Vaccination helps to build immunity and protect children from getting infected. Getting vaccinated at an early age helps to ensure that they are protected before potential exposure.\n\nOption (D) is also incorrect because understanding basic science does not directly determine the likelihood of a child getting smallpox. However, it is worth mentioning that having an understanding of basic science may lead to making informed decisions about vaccination.\n\nOption (A) is the correct answer. It suggests that if parents base their medical decisions on advice from \"has-been adult entertainers,\" it is likely they are not seeking reliable or accurate information regarding smallpox vaccination. This would increase the child's likelihood of getting smallpox because they may miss out on necessary prevention measures.\n\nIn summary, option (A) is the correct answer because it suggests a lack of reliable medical advice, which could potentially result in children not receiving proper vaccination and thus being more likely to contract smallpox."

This is because vaccination is a crucial method of prevention against smallpox, and if parents do not follow proper medical advice and choose not to vaccinate their children, they are more susceptible to contracting the disease. Option (B) is incorrect because undergoing vaccination at an early age is the recommended practice for preventing smallpox. Option (C) is similar to option (B) and also correct since early vaccination is effective against smallpox. Option (D) is also correct as having parents who understand basic science will likely lead to them making informed decisions about vaccination and disease prevention.
