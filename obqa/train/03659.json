If birds are singing, the sun is shining, and temperatures are high, it suggests a warm and sunny day. In such conditions, the daylight would be longer because the sun is out for a longer duration. Therefore, option (B) \"luminescence is long\" is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because if the sun is shining, daylight is typically longer. Option (C) is unrelated to the given information and is a misleading option. Option (D) is incorrect because high temperatures and the sun shining suggest warm weather, not freezing nights."
