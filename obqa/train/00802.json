While collecting nectar, bees inadvertently gather pollen grains on their bodies, which then gets transferred to other flowers as they move from one flower to another. This process is called pollination. As the bees move from flower to flower, they help in the transfer of pollen and assist in plant reproduction. Bees gathering nectar is the activity that can lead to animal gathering seeds.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because bees do not make nectar, they collect it from flowers. Option (B) is incorrect because bees make honey from the nectar they collect, but it is not directly related to seed gathering. Option (C) is incorrect because bees stinging humans has no direct relationship with seed gathering."
