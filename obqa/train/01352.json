During photosynthesis, plants convert carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into sugars, specifically glucose, which serves as food for the plant. Option (A) is incorrect because photosynthesis does not convert carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into dirt. Option (B) is incorrect because sunlight is one of the ingredients needed for photosynthesis, not the end product. Option (C) is incorrect because photosynthesis does not produce mental energy, but rather chemical energy in the form of sugars."
