Female platypuses have a specialized pouch where they lay eggs and incubate them until they hatch. Once the baby platypuses are ready, they emerge or are \"birthed\" from the pouch. Option (A) is incorrect because it is past tense and does not make grammatical sense in the sentence. Option (B) is incorrect because it implies death, which is not the case.
