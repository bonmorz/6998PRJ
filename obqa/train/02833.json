Hummingbirds are attracted to flowers because of the sweet, sugary nectar they produce. While collecting nectar, hummingbirds inadvertently pick up pollen on their feathers and beak. As they move from flower to flower, they transfer this pollen, which leads to pollination. Additionally, as hummingbirds feed on nectar, they may accidentally brush against the stamen and pistil, allowing for fertilization and the development of seeds. Option (B) is irrelevant and not related to hummingbirds or seed dispersal. Option (C) is incorrect because swimming in bleach is harmful to hummingbirds and not related to seed dispersal. Option (D) is completely unrelated to the topic of hummingbirds and their role in seed dispersal."
