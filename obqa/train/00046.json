Option (A) describes a lost dog by the river, with small rodents. This scenario suggests that the dog has access to water and potential food sources in the form of small rodents. The availability of resources increases the dog's chances of survival.\n\nOption (B) describes a cat left in the desert. The desert is a harsh environment with limited sources of water and food. Cats are not well adapted to survive in such conditions, so it is less likely that the cat would survive compared to the other options.\n\nOption (C) describes a man drifting a raft at sea without supplies. In this scenario, the man is completely dependent on external sources for survival. Without supplies, such as food and water, it is unlikely that the man would survive for an extended period.\n\nOption (D) states that none of these would be more likely to survive.

Option (A) states that a lost dog by the river, with small rodents, would be more likely to survive. \n\nThis choice is plausible because having access to a water source (river) and small rodents for potential food would increase the dog's chances of survival. Dogs can hunt small rodents for sustenance, and having a water source nearby would prevent dehydration.\n\nOption (B) suggests that a cat left in the desert would be more likely to survive. However, the desert is an extreme environment with limited resources, including food and water. Cats are not typically adapted to desert survival, making it unlikely for a cat to survive without sufficient access to these basic necessities.\n\nOption (C) mentions a man drifting a raft at sea without supplies. In this scenario, the lack of supplies, including food and water, would significantly decrease the man's chances of survival. It's difficult to find sustenance on the open sea, and without any supplies, his survival would be highly unlikely.\n\nOption (D) states that none of these options are likely to survive. However, given the context provided, option (A) is the most viable choice since it mentions a situation where the animal has available resources and potentially favorable conditions to sustain itself.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the options, option (A) - a lost dog by the river, with small rodents - is the most likely to survive."
