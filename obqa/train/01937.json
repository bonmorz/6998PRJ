When light enters the eye, it passes through the transparent cornea and into the pupil, which is the black circular opening in the center of the iris. The role of the pupil is to regulate the amount of light that enters the eye. Once the light passes through the pupil, it reaches the lens of the eye, which focuses the light onto the retina at the back of the eye. From there, diverse light energy is converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain for processing. Option (B) is incorrect because bacteria are not supposed to enter the eye. Option (C) is incorrect because air does not enter the eye through the pupil. Option (D) is incorrect because drops of water do not typically enter the eye in this manner."
