Eye color (option A) is determined by genes, so it is an incorrect answer. Height (option B) is influenced by both genes and the environment, but it has a strong genetic component, so it is not the best answer. Number of chromosomes (option D) is determined solely by genetics, so it is also an incorrect answer. Hair length (option C), however, can be influenced by environmental factors such as grooming, diet, and exposure to certain chemicals or treatments. Therefore, hair length is generally determined by environmental factors rather than heredity."

Traits that are determined by environmental factors are influenced by external factors such as diet, climate, and exposure to certain stimuli. Traits that are determined by heredity are inherited from parents and are genetically determined.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because eye color is generally determined by heredity. While certain external factors like sunlight and age can cause changes in the appearance of the eyes, the base eye color is determined by genetics.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect because height is influenced by a combination of genetic factors and environmental factors, such as nutrition and overall health. Both genetic factors and environmental factors play a role in determining a person's height.\n\nOption (C) is the correct answer because hair length is primarily determined by environmental factors, such as how often the hair is cut, how it is styled, and the hair care products that are used. While genetics can play a minor role in determining the growth rate and thickness of hair, overall hair length is largely influenced by environmental factors.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the number of chromosomes is a genetic trait that is determined by heredity. The number of chromosomes an organism has is determined by its genetic makeup and is not influenced by external environmental factors."
