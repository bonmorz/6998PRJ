Renewable resources are those that can be replenished naturally or through human intervention, and they are not depleted over time. \n\nOption (A) - Solar energy is a renewable resource because it is derived from the sun, which is an infinite source of energy. The sun's rays can be converted into electricity or used directly for heating and lighting purposes.\n\nOption (B) - Water source refers to harnessing the power of flowing water, such as rivers or tides, to generate electricity. This is also a renewable resource because water is constantly replenished through the water cycle.\n\nOption (C) - Hydrocarbon gas mixture is not a renewable resource. Hydrocarbons, such as natural gas, oil, and coal, are fossil fuels that are formed over millions of years from the remains of ancient plants and animals. Once these resources are depleted, they cannot be replenished within a human lifetime.\n\nOption (D) - Wind power is a renewable resource because it utilizes the energy from wind to generate electricity. Wind is a natural phenomenon that is continuously produced on Earth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) hydrocarbon gas mixture, as it is not a renewable resource. Options (A), (B), and (D) are all examples of renewable resources."
