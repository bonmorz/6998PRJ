Hornets, including red hornets, can sting multiple times because they do not have a barbed stinger like honeybees. Instead, they have a smooth stinger that can be withdrawn from the victim's skin without causing the hornet any harm. Therefore, option (D) is correct. Options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the hornet's stinging mechanism."
