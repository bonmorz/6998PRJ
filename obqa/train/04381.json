As Antarctica decreases in size, it means that the ice sheets and glaciers are melting and reducing in extent. This melting of ice contributes to rising sea levels.\n\nGiven that Fiji is an island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, a decrease in the size of Antarctica and the subsequent rise in sea levels would directly affect Fiji. Option (A) states that Fiji will be \"gone,\" which means that it will be submerged and no longer exist. This is the correct answer because as sea levels rise, low-lying islands like Fiji are at risk of being completely submerged under water.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because the decrease in size of Antarctica and rising sea levels may disrupt ecosystems and potentially affect fish populations, making it worse for fishing. Option (C) is also incorrect because the impacts of rising sea levels are generally negative and may lead to economic losses rather than increased wealth. Option (D) is not directly related to the decrease in size of Antarctica and its impact on Fiji. Although rising sea levels may contribute to environmental changes, it does not necessarily mean Fiji will become colder."
