When a population is stagnant, it means that the number of individuals remains the same over time, with no new additions. In the case of zebras, if there is a lack of new baby zebras, the population will not grow. Instead, it will gradually decrease in size over time, leading to shrinkage. Option (A) is incorrect because sadness is an emotional response and not directly related to population dynamics. Option (B) is also incorrect because resurgence implies a sudden increase, which is not likely to happen in a stagnant population with no new births. Option (D) is incorrect because regrowth implies an increase in the population, which is not the case here."
