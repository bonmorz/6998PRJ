Melting occurs when a solid substance is heated to its melting point, resulting in it transforming into a liquid state. Option (D) is the correct answer because using a hairdryer to turn ice to water involves applying heat to the ice, causing it to melt and become water. Option (A) is incorrect because cooking stew in a crockpot involves boiling rather than melting.
