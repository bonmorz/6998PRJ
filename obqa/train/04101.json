Some animals, when faced with a predator, try to escape by moving briskly. Moving quickly and briskly allows them to outmaneuver the predator and increase their chances of survival. Option (A) is incorrect because moving slowly would make it easier for predators to catch them. Option (B) is unrelated to escaping predators and is subjective. Option (D) is not necessarily true as animals may need to change their speed depending on the situation."

Moving happily (option B) is a subjective response and not related to predator evasion. Moving steadily (option D) could also be an effective strategy, but not all animals would choose this option as it may make them more predictable and easier to catch."
