Desertification refers to the process of land becoming desert-like due to factors such as deforestation, overgrazing, and climate change.\n\nOption (A) states that sowing a seed for each felled tree would result in the reversal of desertification. This is the correct answer. Replanting trees helps to restore vegetation in areas affected by deforestation. Trees play a crucial role in maintaining soil moisture, preventing soil erosion, and providing habitat for other plants and animals. By replanting trees, we can help restore the ecosystem and stop further desertification.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because cutting down as many trees as possible would exacerbate desertification. This would remove the remaining vegetation, leading to increased soil erosion and loss of habitat for various species.\n\nOption (C) is also incorrect because taking all the water away from deserts would worsen desertification.

Removing water would accelerate the drying out of the land, leading to further desertification.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A) sowing a seed for each felled tree, as this helps restore vegetation and combat desertification."
