A learned behavior is a behavior that is acquired through experience and practice, rather than being innate or instinctual.\n\nOption (A) birds building nests is not a learned behavior because it is a natural behavior that birds are born with the instinct to do. Option (B) cats making hairballs is also not a learned behavior because it is a natural physiological response to grooming and does not require learning. Option (C) dolphins' echolocation is also not a learned behavior because it is a natural ability that dolphins are born with.\n\nOption (D) dogs playing fetch, on the other hand, is a learned behavior. Dogs do not have an innate understanding of the game of fetch. They learn to retrieve a thrown object and bring it back through training and repeated practice. This behavior is not instinctual and requires learning.\n\nTherefore, option (D) dogs playing fetch is considered a learned behavior."
