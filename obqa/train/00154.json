The shape of the vase is altered as the pieces may no longer fit together as they did before. The mass of the vase is also changed because some pieces may be lost or broken off, reducing the overall mass of the vase. Option (A) is not applicable in this case because the center of gravity of an object is determined by the distribution of its mass, and breaking the vase does not change this. Option (C) is incorrect because breaking a vase does not chemically alter its composition. Option (D) is also incorrect as breaking a vase does not affect its speed."
