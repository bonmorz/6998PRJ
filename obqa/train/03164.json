Plastics (option A), coal (option C), and diesel (option D) are all non-renewable resources because they are derived from fossil fuels, which take millions of years to form and cannot be replenished at the same rate they are used. On the other hand, leather (option B) can be renewed because it is derived from animal hides, which can be sustainably farmed and harvested. This means that new hides can be obtained without depleting the population of animals."

Renewable resources are those that can be replenished or regenerated naturally within a relatively short period of time. Non-renewable resources, on the other hand, cannot be easily replenished and are finite in quantity.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because plastics are derived from petroleum, which is a non-renewable resource. Plastics themselves are not renewable.\n\nOption (B) is correct because leather comes from animal hides, which can be replenished through the process of raising and rearing animals.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because coal is a fossil fuel and a non-renewable resource. It takes millions of years for coal to form and it cannot be easily replenished.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because diesel fuel is derived from petroleum, which is a non-renewable resource.\n\nTherefore, the only option that represents a renewable resource is (B) leather."
