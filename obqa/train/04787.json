The chamber is built in Arctic permafrost and is maintained by the Norwegian government for use in the event of a disaster. Based on this information, the most logical answer is that the storage chamber holds preserved seeds for reproducing edible crops. This is because in the event of a disaster, it would be important to have a supply of seeds to grow food for sustenance. Option (A) is incorrect because the seeds in the chamber are not specified to be currently growing. Option (B) is incorrect because there is no mention of seeds for Arctic animals. Option (C) is incorrect because there is no mention of seeds that spread permafrost, and it is unclear how seeds would spread permafrost in the first place."
