Small reptiles in Texas have the ability to change their colors between brown and green as a form of camouflage to blend in with their surroundings and remain concealed from predators. This adaptation is known as concealment, which is option (B). Option (A) is incorrect because sunscreen is not related to reptilian color change. Option (C) is unrelated to reptilian behavior. Option (D) is also unrelated, as cooling agents are not involved in the reptiles' ability to change color."

Many small reptiles, such as certain lizard species, have the ability to change their skin color based on their environment and situation, a phenomenon known as camouflage. When these reptiles feel the need to blend in with their surroundings, they can change their skin color to either brown or green, allowing them to conceal themselves and become less visible to potential predators or prey. Option (A) is incorrect because sunscreen is unrelated to the color-changing abilities of reptiles. Option (C) is also unrelated because social media has nothing to do with reptile camouflage. Option (D) is incorrect because cooling agent refers to something that lowers temperature, which does not relate to the reptile's ability to change color."
