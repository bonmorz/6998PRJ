When an animal gets too cold, its body may not be able to perform its essential functions, such as maintaining metabolism, circulation, and other bodily processes. This can ultimately lead to the animal's death or perishing due to coldness. Option (B) is incorrect because laughing to death is not a consequence of getting too cold. Option (C) is unrelated and not a plausible response. Option (D) is also unrelated and not a typical response to extreme coldness."

When an animal gets too cold for its body to perform its functions, it will perish due to the coldness. Extreme cold can negatively impact an animal's ability to maintain its body temperature and carry out necessary physiological processes, eventually leading to death. Option (B) is not accurate because extreme cold would not cause an animal to laugh. Option (C) is unrelated to the effects of cold on animals. Option (D) is not applicable to the question as it does not describe the outcome for an animal that gets too cold."
