Therefore, he did not dismiss any of these celestial bodies as \"mere stars.\" Option (D) is also incorrect because Galileo made detailed observations of the moon and discovered mountains and craters on its surface. Option (B) is incorrect because Galileo observed Venus and discovered that it went through phases like the moon, providing evidence for the heliocentric model of the solar system. Option (C) is incorrect because Galileo observed and was able to discern the rings of Saturn. This leaves us with option (A), Neptune, as the correct answer. Galileo observed Neptune multiple times but mistook it for a fixed star and did not recognize it as a planet."

Galileo was a famous astronomer who made significant advancements in the field of astronomy. He discovered that the moon had craters and mountains, observed moons orbiting Jupiter, and determined that Venus had phases like the moon.\n\nIn Galileo's observations, he noted that Venus had phases, similar to the moon. This led him to conclude that Venus was orbiting the sun and not the Earth. However, during his observations, Galileo made a mistake. He erroneously observed that Venus appeared crescent-shaped at certain times, similar to how the moon appears crescent-shaped during certain phases.\n\nBased on this mistaken observation, Galileo dismissed Venus as a mere star. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) Venus. Option (A) Neptune, option (C) Saturn, and option (D) the moon are incorrect because they do not relate to Galileo's observation of a star."
