While air pollution can occur naturally in some cases (such as volcanic eruptions or forest fires), the most common and significant source of air pollution is human activity, specifically actions by businesses and industries.

Option (A) is incorrect because air pollution does not develop on its own. Option (B) is also incorrect because while a hurricane can cause damage and destruction, it is not a significant source of air pollution.
