Greenhouses are structures that are designed to trap heat from the sun and create a warm and controlled environment for plants to grow. Option (A) is incorrect because greenhouses do not trap dangerous gases released by plants, but rather trap heat and provide a controlled atmosphere. Option (C) is incorrect because greenhouses are designed to keep plants warm and provide them with optimal growing conditions. Option (D) is incorrect because greenhouses actually protect plants from extreme weather conditions, such as snow and frost, which can be detrimental to plant growth."
