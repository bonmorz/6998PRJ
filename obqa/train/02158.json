Insects, such as ants or beetles, may run from a predator like a lizard that poses a threat to their safety. Option (B) is incorrect because an insect would not typically run from another insect, unless it is a larger or more aggressive species. Option (C) is unlikely as insects do not perceive clouds as a threat. Option (D) is also unlikely because insects are usually able to navigate and fly in windy conditions without needing to run away."
