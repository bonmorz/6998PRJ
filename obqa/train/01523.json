When a person smokes, the smoke irritates the lining of the respiratory system, causing inflammation and an increase in mucus production. This can lead to a persistent cough that is more intense than a non-smoker's cough. Option (A) is incorrect because smoking is not directly linked to hearing loss. Option (B) is also incorrect because while smoking can indirectly affect sleep by causing respiratory issues, it does not directly affect sleep. Option (D) is incorrect because smoking can actually suppress appetite and decrease hunger."

This is because smoking irritates the lungs and airways, leading to increased mucus production and inflammation. As a result, individuals who smoke often experience a more intense and persistent cough compared to non-smokers. Option (A) is incorrect because smoking is not a direct cause of hearing loss. Option (B) is partially true, as smoking can disrupt sleep due to nicotine's stimulating effects, but it is not a direct effect of smoking. Option (D) is also incorrect because smoking can suppress appetite and lead to decreased hunger."
