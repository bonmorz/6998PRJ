When a pork chop is underdone, it means that it has not been cooked to the recommended internal temperature. Undercooked pork can contain harmful bacteria such as Salmonella or E. coli, which can cause food poisoning and illness if consumed. The likelihood of illness spreading to consumers of undercooked pork is considered extreme, as the bacteria present in the meat can easily cause infections and sickness. Options (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the potential risks associated with consuming undercooked pork."

If a pork chop is undercooked or underdone, it is more likely to contain harmful bacteria such as Salmonella or E. coli.
