They are known to migrate long distances in search of food and suitable habitats. Option (B) is incorrect because while bears may cover large distances in search of food, their movement is not primarily driven by instinct but by necessity. Option (C) is incorrect because chipmunks do not typically travel long distances as part of their instinctive behavior. Option (D) is incorrect because snakes do not migrate long distances as part of their instinctive behavior."

Ravens are known for their long-distance migrations, flying great distances as part of their instinctive behavior. While bears may migrate short distances, they do not generally travel great distances. Chipmunks also do not travel long distances as part of their natural behavior. Snakes may move to find food or suitable habitat, but they do not typically migrate long distances. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) a raven."
