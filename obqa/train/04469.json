When hiking up the side of an inactive volcano, it is most likely to find minerals. Volcanoes are formed by the accumulation of molten rock, or magma, which contains various minerals.

Inactive volcanoes are formed by the solidification of magma and lava from past volcanic activity. As a result, they often contain various minerals that were brought up from the Earth's mantle. While it is possible to find traces of metals like mercury, diamonds, or gold near volcanoes, the most likely find would be minerals. Option (C) is the correct answer because it is the most common and general category of substances that can be found near an inactive volcano. Option (A) is less likely since mercury is a heavy metal and not commonly associated with volcanic activity. Options (B) and (D) are also less likely as diamonds and gold are not typically found in abundance near volcanoes."
