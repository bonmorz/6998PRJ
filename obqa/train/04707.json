Option (B) is the correct answer because a typhoon can cause overflowing wetness due to the heavy rainfall it brings. Option (A) is incorrect because a typhoon would not directly cause diminished lakes. Option (C) is incorrect because a typhoon may cause flooding, but it does not necessarily result in population floods. Option (D) is incorrect because a typhoon is associated with rain, so it would not cause rivers to dry up."
