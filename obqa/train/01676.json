While factors such as nutrition and exercise can influence height to some extent during childhood and adolescence, once growth plates in our bones have fused, our height is essentially set and cannot be changed. Option (A) is incorrect because the cost of altering weight has no relevance to the question. Option (B) is incorrect because while we cannot change our height once growth is complete, it is not impossible for humans to change their weight. Option (D) is incorrect because the difficulty of changing height is not the reason we cannot change it."
