Increasing the viability of food means increasing its ability to survive and remain fresh without spoiling. Option (C) is the correct answer because when you increase the viability of food, you increase its ability to disperse, meaning it can be distributed over a wider area and reach more people before it spoils. Option (A) is incorrect because increasing viability means decreasing waste. Option (B) is incorrect because modifying food is not necessarily related to increasing its viability. Option (D) is incorrect because displacing food does not relate to its viability."
