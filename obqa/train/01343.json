Acquired characteristics refer to traits or characteristics that an organism develops or acquires during its lifetime, as opposed to traits that are determined by genetics. Immediate surroundings, or the environment in which the organism lives and interacts with, can have a significant impact on the acquisition of certain characteristics. For example, exposure to certain chemicals or toxins in the environment can lead to the development of new traits or changes in existing traits. The moon (option A) and gravity (option B) do not directly influence acquired characteristics. The reference to \"birthday\" (option D) is unrelated and does not affect acquired characteristics."
