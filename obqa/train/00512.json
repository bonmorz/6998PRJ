When a habitat is destroyed, animals such as raccoons can lose their homes as their natural environment is no longer available to them. Option (B) is incorrect because birds typically migrate based on seasonal changes and not specifically due to habitat destruction. Option (C) is unlikely as habitat destruction usually disrupts the balance and can lead to a decrease in animal reproduction rather than a boom. Option (D) is not directly related to habitat destruction, as hibernation is a natural behavior of bears during cold seasons."
