Option (A), tree zones, is often green because trees and other vegetation in these areas have chlorophyll which gives them their green color. Option (B), arctics, is incorrect because the arctic region is mostly covered in ice and snow, and there is little vegetation. Option (C), deserts, is incorrect because deserts are known for their scarcity of vegetation and are often brown, sandy, or rocky. Option (D), oceans, can be green in some areas due to the presence of algae and other aquatic plants, but it is not a characteristic shared by all oceans. Therefore, option (A) is the most accurate answer."
