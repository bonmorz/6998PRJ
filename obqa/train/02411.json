Trees act as a carbon sink, helping to offset carbon emissions.\n\nOptions (B), (C), and (D) all contribute to atmospheric carbon to some degree. Humans, through our use of fossil fuels, have a significant impact on carbon emissions. Cattle, as mentioned earlier, contribute to methane emissions. Dogs, while they may contribute to environmental impacts in other ways, do not directly contribute to atmospheric carbon.\n\nTherefore, (A) trees would increase atmospheric carbon by the lowest degree."
