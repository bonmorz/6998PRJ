A rock quarry is a place where rocks are extracted from the earth for various purposes. Rocks are made up of minerals and do not naturally contain items like sunflowers, candles, or broken toys. However, it is possible for a rock quarry to contain rocks with foil materials. Foil materials, such as metallic minerals like mica or pyrite, can be found in certain types of rocks. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer as it is the only option that is plausible in the context of a rock quarry."
