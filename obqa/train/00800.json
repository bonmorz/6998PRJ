Heat and pressure can change the remains of plants, specifically leaves, into natural gas. Over millions of years, layers of sediment can build up on top of plant remains, subjecting them to high temperatures and pressure. This process, called diagenesis, converts organic matter into natural gas. Options (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because they do not undergo the same process of fossil fuel formation."
