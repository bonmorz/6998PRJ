Option (A) is incorrect because the color of a person's eyes does not change with age. Option (B) is incorrect because baldness is typically associated with aging and can occur later in life. Option (C) is incorrect because gray hair is also associated with aging and can occur later in life. Option (D) is incorrect because wrinkled skin is a common sign of aging and can occur later in life. Therefore, the only correct answer is (A), as the old man would have had brown eyes when he was younger."

Option (B) baldness is incorrect because baldness is typically a result of genetics or other factors, not something that changes with age.

While hair color, baldness, and the appearance of skin may change with age, eye color typically remains the same throughout a person's life. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. Options (B), (C), and (D) are all possible characteristics that may develop or change with age."
