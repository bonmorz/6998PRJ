During incomplete metamorphosis, the insect goes through three stages: egg, nymph, and adult.

Insects with incomplete metamorphosis may be found in various environments, including on the head or body of a human or animal.\n\nOptions (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because insects with incomplete metamorphosis are not found in space, on the moon, or on Jupiter.
