When the fan is turned on, electricity powers the motor inside the fan, causing the blades to spin. As the blades move, they create airflow that helps to evaporate sweat from our skin, making us feel cooler. Option (A) is incorrect because a magic carpet does not rely on electrical conversion to keep things cool. Option (B) is unrelated to electrical conversion. Option (C) is incorrect because a light bulb produces light, not cooling effects."
