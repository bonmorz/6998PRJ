Carbon dioxide is a waste product of cellular respiration and is expelled from the body through exhalation. When we breathe, air enters the body through the nose or mouth, passes through the trachea (windpipe), and eventually travels down into the lungs. The air then moves into the bronchial tubes and finally reaches the alveoli, which are tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange takes place. From the alveoli, oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is released. The carbon dioxide then travels back up through the bronchial tubes, into the trachea, and out of the body through the nose or mouth.
