In this context, a whiteout refers to a weather phenomenon where there is a heavy snowfall, which greatly reduces visibility. After a whiteout, the most logical step would be to remove the snow that is obstructing your vision and causing the whiteout conditions. Option (B) is incorrect because it is unrelated to the situation and refers to a video game. Option (C) is also unrelated because it suggests wanting more snow rather than dealing with the existing whiteout.
