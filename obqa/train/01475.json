Locusts are known as agricultural pests and have historically had a negative effect on crops. They feed on vegetation, including crops, and can cause significant damage to agricultural fields. Option (A) is incorrect because locusts are not in the sky, they are on the ground and can fly. Option (C) is not necessarily true as locusts can affect crops regardless of their proximity to water. Option (D) is also incorrect as locusts have never been known to have a positive impact on crops. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."
