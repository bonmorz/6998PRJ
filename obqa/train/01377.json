When a storm rolls in and the skies are filled with dark clouds, it typically means that precipitation is about to occur. These dark clouds are called cumulonimbus clouds, which are associated with thunderstorms and heavy rain. Option (A) is incorrect because clouds do not melt. Option (B) is incorrect because flooding is a result of heavy rain, not a characteristic of clouds. Option (D) is incorrect because clouds do not scurry, as scurrying implies quick movement, whereas clouds move slowly and gradually."
