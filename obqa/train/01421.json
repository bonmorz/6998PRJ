Each growth ring represents one year of the tree's life. Option (D) is the correct answer because counting the number of rings will provide an accurate estimate of the tree's age. Option (A) is incorrect because the size of branches can vary based on factors other than the tree's age. Option (B) is incorrect because the number of leaves can also vary based on factors like seasonal changes.
