When a person engages in physical activity, such as running, their pulse rate increases. This is because the muscles require more oxygen during exercise, and the heart needs to pump blood at a faster rate to supply the oxygen. Option (B) is incorrect because pulse rate typically decreases when a person falls asleep. Option (C) is incorrect because pulse rate would generally decrease as a runner slows down and rests. Option (D) is incorrect because holding yoga poses may involve some level of physical exertion, but it is not specified in the question and typically not as intense as running, therefore not as likely to increase pulse rate significantly."

The pulse rate, or heart rate, increases as the pace of a runner quickens. This is because when we engage in intense physical activity, our muscles require more oxygen and nutrients, which is delivered to them by an increased blood flow. To meet this demand, the heart pumps faster, resulting in an increased pulse rate. Option (B) is incorrect because the pulse rate generally decreases when a person falls asleep, as the body is in a relaxed state. Option (C) is incorrect because as a runner slows down, the intensity of their physical activity decreases, resulting in a lower pulse rate. Option (D) is incorrect because while holding yoga poses can require strength and balance, it does not typically involve intense cardiovascular effort that would significantly increase the pulse rate."
