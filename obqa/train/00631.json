Incomplete metamorphosis refers to a type of development in insects where they do not go through a pupal stage (cocooning) like butterflies do. Instead, they go through three stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Option (A) is correct because certain moths are able to skip the cocooning stage and develop directly into adults. Options (B), (C), and (D) are not related to incomplete metamorphosis and are incorrect."
