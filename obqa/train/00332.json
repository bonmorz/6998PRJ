This is because the sun's rays are coming from directly above, perpendicular to the objects on the ground, causing the shadows to disappear. \n\nOption (B) is incorrect because shadows on trees are longest when the sun is low in the sky, such as during sunrise or sunset. Option (C) is not directly related to the position of the sun at noon, but rather the use of shadows on sundials to tell time throughout the day. Option (D) is also incorrect because the sun's temperature can vary depending on various factors such as location and time of year, and it may not necessarily be the hottest at noon. The correct answer is therefore option (A), as it accurately describes the absence of shadows."

Sundials can work throughout the day, but they are more useful when the sun is not directly overhead as the shadow will be longer and easier to read.\n\nOption (D) is unrelated to the position of the sun at noon.
