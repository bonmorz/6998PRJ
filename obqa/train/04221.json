Option (A), using bug killer on crops, can contribute to pollution because many bug killers contain harmful chemicals that can contaminate the soil, water, and air. Option (B), avoiding spilling oil into oceans, is a positive action that helps to prevent pollution. Option (C), placing plastics in special containers, is also a positive action that promotes proper waste disposal. Option (D), making laws against littering, is a positive action that helps to prevent litter and pollution. Therefore, option (A) is the only option that represents a human action that can cause pollution."

Option (A), using bug killer on crops, can cause pollution because many bug killers contain harmful chemicals that can leach into the soil and water, impacting ecosystems and harming non-target species. Option (B), avoiding spilling oil into oceans, is actually a positive action that helps prevent pollution. Option (C), placing plastics in special containers, is also a positive action that promotes proper waste management.
