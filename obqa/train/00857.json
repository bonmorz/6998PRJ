A desert environment is characterized by arid and dry conditions, which are not conducive to the survival of fish or banana trees, as they require a significant amount of water. Redwoods, which are large trees, also need a more humid climate and are not adapted to desert environments. Insects, on the other hand, have adaptations that allow them to survive in arid conditions, such as the ability to conserve water and hide in the sand. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) insects."

Redwoods (option C) are giant trees that typically grow in moist and cool environments, so they would not be able to survive in a desert.
