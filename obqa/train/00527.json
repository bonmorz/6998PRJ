Over time, when a boulder is exposed to various elements such as heat from the sun, crashing waves, and storms, it will undergo weathering and erosion. This means that the boulder will break down, get worn away, and gradually disintegrate into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces will then become part of the surrounding soil, resulting in the area where the boulder stood becoming earth. Options (B), (C), and (D) are not related to geological processes and are therefore incorrect."

Over time, the heat from the sun, the force of waves crashing down, and the impact of huge storms can cause gradual erosion on a large boulder at the shore.

As a result, after a few hundred years, the boulder may be reduced to smaller rock fragments or sand, which eventually become part of the surrounding earth.

Over time, the heat from the sun, constant crashing waves, and severe storms will erode the boulder, breaking it down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces will then be further broken down by natural processes such as wind, water, and ice. Eventually, the boulder will become fine particles of sediment that will be transported away by natural forces and deposited elsewhere. The result is that the area where the boulder stood will become a part of the Earth's overall landscape, consisting of soil and other types of sediment.
