They gather assorted materials such as twigs, grass, leaves, and feathers to construct their nests. Option (B) is incorrect because trash cans are not natural nesting sites for birds. Option (C) is also incorrect because chimneys are not typical nesting sites for birds. Option (D) is too broad and could potentially be correct, but it does not specifically mention the materials used to build the nest. Therefore, option (A) is the most accurate and specific answer."
