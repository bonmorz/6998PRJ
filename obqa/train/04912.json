Option (A), concrete jungles, would be an unsuitable environment for a rose because concrete does not provide the necessary soil conditions for growth. Option (C), in someone's stomach, is incorrect because roses are plants and cannot survive or grow in the digestive system. Option (D), on a brick, is also incorrect because bricks do not provide the necessary conditions for rose growth and would not support the plant's roots."
