Water vapor, which is the gaseous form of water, plays a crucial role in creating and maintaining habitats. It contributes to the moisture in the atmosphere, which is necessary for the survival of many plants and animals. Option (A) is incorrect because water vapor does not directly affect the sidewalk. Option (B) is incorrect because although water vapor can contribute to the water content in a pool, it does not help specifically with pools. Option (C) is unrelated to water vapor as it pertains to cats."
