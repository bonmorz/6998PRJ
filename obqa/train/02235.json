Flippers are typically found in marine animals such as seals, sea lions, and turtles. These animals often live in saltwater habitats such as oceans and seas. The reference to carrying a home with them suggests that the creature is a turtle, as they have a protective shell that they carry with them. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) salty. Options (A), (B), and (D) are not suitable habitat options for creatures with flippers."

Flippers are typically associated with marine animals, such as seals or sea turtles, which live in water habitats. They use their flippers to swim and navigate through the water. The mention of \"carrying a home with it\" in the question suggests that the creature in question is a hermit crab, which carries a shell as its protective home. Hermit crabs are found in coastal areas, particularly in saltwater environments. Therefore, the most likely habitat for a creature with flippers and carrying a home (shell) with it would be a salty habitat. Options (A), (B), and (D) are not appropriate habitats for creatures with flippers."
