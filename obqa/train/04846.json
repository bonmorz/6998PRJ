Wearing a bikini or shorts exposes a large area of skin to the sun, increasing the risk of sunburn and UV damage. Similarly, wearing nothing provides no protection at all and leaves the skin completely exposed to the harmful effects of UV rays. To effectively avoid too much UV rays, it is recommended to wear protective clothing such as long-sleeved shirts, pants, and a wide-brimmed hat. Additionally, using sunscreen with a high SPF, seeking shade during peak sun hours, and wearing sunglasses can also help in reducing exposure to harmful UV rays."
