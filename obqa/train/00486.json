High temperatures can cause various changes to the Earth's surface, such as melting ice caps, drying up water bodies, causing wildfires, and affecting weather patterns. This option is correct because it identifies a significant factor that can lead to changes on Earth. \n\nOption (B), \"mild weather,\" is incorrect because mild weather refers to moderate or comfortable weather conditions and does not necessarily have a significant impact on changing the Earth. \n\nOption (C), \"large storms,\" is partially correct as large storms can cause temporary changes to Earth, such as erosion and flooding. However, they are not as long-lasting or as impactful as the changes caused by high temperatures.\n\nOption (D), \"snowing clouds,\" is incorrect as it does not describe a primary cause of changes to the Earth. Snowfall is a result of weather conditions and does not directly cause significant changes to the Earth's overall state. \n\nOverall, option (A) is the only answer choice that accurately identifies high temperatures as a significant factor that can lead to changes on Earth."
