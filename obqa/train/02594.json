Different countries experience different times of day because of the rotation of the planet. As the Earth rotates on its axis, different parts of the world receive sunlight while others are in darkness. This creates different time zones and explains why some countries are in bed while others are enjoying the outdoors. Option (A) is incorrect because animals do not influence the time difference between countries. Option (B) is partially correct, as the rotation of the sun relative to the Earth causes day and night, but it does not explain why different countries have different times.
