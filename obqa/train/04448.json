Therefore, a plant needing to photosynthesize will require sunlight. Option (A), in a roofless room, allows the plant to receive direct sunlight. Option (B) and (C), in a cardboard box or a windowless room, would limit or prevent the plant from receiving sunlight. Option (D), in a car with tinted windows, would also block sunlight from reaching the plant. Therefore, option (A) is the best choice for optimal photosynthesis."
