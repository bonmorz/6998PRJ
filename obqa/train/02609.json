This chemical is sticky and smelly, making it unappealing and potentially harmful to would-be predators. Option (A) is incorrect because attracting a mate does not require the use of a sticky and smelly chemical. Option (B) is incorrect because sea hares are not known for their swimming abilities and primarily use water currents and ocean waves to move around.
