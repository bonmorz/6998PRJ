Option (A) is correct because our genetic makeup, including traits like eye color, height, and predisposition to certain diseases, is passed down from our parents. Option (B) is unrelated to genetics and refers to death. Option (C) is incorrect because while genetic information is passed down through reproductive cells like eggs, it is not exclusive to eggs and is also passed down through sperm cells. Option (D) is unrelated and does not make sense in the context of inheritance."
