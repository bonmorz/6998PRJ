Option (D) is likely the correct answer because many plants rely on animals, such as badgers, to act as pollinators. As badgers move from flower to flower, they may inadvertently transfer pollen, aiding in the reproduction of plants. Option (A) is incorrect because the gravity on Mars does not directly aid in plant reproduction. Option (B) is incorrect because human pollution can harm plants and disrupt the natural reproductive processes. Option (C) is unrelated to plant reproduction as it refers to cooking."
