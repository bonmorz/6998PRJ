When plants are brought from the eastern United States to the western United States, they often die because of the wrong climate. Different regions have different climatic conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and sunlight. Plants that are adapted to the eastern United States may not be able to withstand the harsher conditions in the western United States. Option (A) is incorrect because it assumes the problem lies with planting methods, which may not be the case. Option (B) is unrelated to the question and does not explain why the plants die. Option (D) is incorrect because it is too general and does not specify why people kill the plants."
