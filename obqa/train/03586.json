Pesticides are chemicals that are typically used to kill insects, weeds, and other pests that can damage crops. When humans consume food that has been treated with pesticides, there is a potential for these chemicals to accumulate in the body and cause negative health effects. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because rocks are not living organisms and do not have the same physiological response to pesticides. Option (C) is incorrect because sticks are also not living organisms and do not consume food. Option (D) is incorrect because blankets are inanimate objects and do not have any physiological response to pesticides.
