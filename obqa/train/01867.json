Fertilizer can have various risks and negative impacts on the environment and the planet. It can contribute to water pollution by causing excess nutrients to run off into water bodies, leading to algal blooms and oxygen depletion in aquatic ecosystems. Fertilizer can also contribute to soil degradation and reduced biodiversity by altering the nutrient balance and microbial communities in the soil. In some cases, excessive fertilizer use can lead to the accumulation of harmful chemicals in the soil and crops, which may have negative impacts on human health. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer as it highlights the potential risk and damage to the planet that can be associated with using fertilizer. Options (A), (B), and (C) are not risks of using fertilizer, but rather positive effects or actions related to its use."
