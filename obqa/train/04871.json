Options (A), (B), and (D) are all examples of renewable energy sources. Solar energy is derived from the sun and can be harnessed using solar panels. Wind energy is generated by the natural movement of air and can be captured using wind turbines. Hydropower is generated from the movement of water, such as from rivers or dams. Option (C), natural gas, is not considered a renewable energy source because it is a fossil fuel that is formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals. Once it is used up, it cannot be replenished within a reasonable human time frame. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer."

Solar energy is harnessed using solar panels that convert sunlight into electricity, while wind energy is harnessed using wind turbines.\n\nOption (C) Natural Gas is not considered a renewable energy source. Natural gas is a fossil fuel that is formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals. It is a finite resource and takes millions of years to form, so it cannot be replenished within a human lifespan. While it is considered a cleaner-burning fossil fuel compared to coal or oil, it is still a non-renewable resource.\n\nOption (D) Hydropower is also considered a renewable energy source. It is generated by harnessing the energy from flowing or falling water, such as rivers or waterfalls. The water cycle continually replenishes the water sources, making hydropower a sustainable and renewable source of energy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Natural Gas because it is not a renewable energy source."
