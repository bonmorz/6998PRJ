Option (D) is correct because birds often eat fruits and then disperse the seeds through their droppings. The hard objects found in fruit, such as seeds, can pass through a bird's digestive system intact and be deposited in a new location, allowing for the spread of plants. Option (A) is incorrect because birds do not dance to attract predators, they use various displays and calls for attracting mates. Option (B) is also incorrect because birds do not bury seeds to hide them from other birds, but rather to store them for later consumption. Option (C) is incorrect because birds do not typically hide seeds in hollow trees for winter storage, although some species may cache food in trees or other locations."

Option (C) is incorrect because birds do not hide seeds in hollow trees, but rather eat them immediately or store them in caches for later consumption.

Option (C) is partly correct, as some birds do hide seeds in different locations for winter food storage, but it does not fully capture the relationship between birds and plants. Option (D) is the correct answer because birds can spread the seeds of plants through their droppings. Some plants have adapted to have hard-coated seeds that can survive the digestive system of birds, allowing them to be dispersed over larger areas and contribute to the plant's reproduction."
