An earthquake is a seismic event that can result in the shifting and movement of tectonic plates, which can lead to changes in the geography of an area.

Options (A), (B), and (C) are all natural events that can cause changes to the Earth's surface, but they are not typically associated with map redraws. Option (D), an earthquake, is the correct answer as it is a common event that can result in significant changes to the Earth's surface."
