A person lost in a maze will need to rely on their own navigation skills and problem-solving abilities to find their way out. They cannot rely on external sources such as television or spirits. Option (B) is the correct answer because a compass, which uses magnets to point to the Earth's magnetic North, can be a helpful tool for orienting oneself and finding a way out of a forest. Option (D) is incorrect because relying on deer would not be a reliable or practical strategy for finding one's way out of a forest."

When a person is lost in a maze, there is only one correct path to follow in order to find the way out, and that person needs to navigate it alone. However, when a person is lost in a forest, they may have some options for finding their way out. Option (B) is correct because it suggests using magnets. This refers to the use of a compass, which can help guide a person in the right direction. Option (A) is incorrect because relying on television is not a practical or logical solution for finding one's way out of a forest. Option (C) is incorrect because relying on spirits is not a reliable or tangible method for navigation. Option (D) is incorrect because relying on deer as a guide would not be effective or practical."

When a person is lost in a maze, they are typically in a structured and controlled environment with set paths and walls that prevent them from easily finding their way out. In this case, they need to rely on their own navigation skills to find their way out.\n\nOn the other hand, when a person is lost in a forest, they are in a more natural and open environment with various landmarks and natural features. In this case, they can rely on methods such as using a compass or following the direction of sunlight to find their way out. One of the options, relying on magnets (option B), aligns with this idea as a compass, which uses magnets, can help someone navigate in a forest. \n\nOptions (A) and (C) can be easily eliminated as they involve external, unrelated factors. Relying on television is irrelevant as there would not be any televisions in a forest to guide someone. Relying on spirits is also unrelated as there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of spirits and their ability to navigate. Option (D) can also be eliminated as relying on deer would assume that the deer will lead the person out, which is unlikely and not a reliable method of finding one's way out of a forest."
