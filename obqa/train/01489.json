There are certain species of ray-finned fish that have a commensal relationship with sharks, meaning they attach themselves to the shark's body for protection or to scavenge off its leftovers without harming the shark. Option (A) is incorrect because it is not common for sharks to have other sharks attached to them. Option (C) is also incorrect because jellyfish and sharks do not typically have a symbiotic relationship. Option (D) is incorrect because turtles do not attach to sharks but may interact with them in other ways in their natural habitats."

Certain species of ray-finned fish, such as remoras, have a unique adaptation that allows them to attach themselves to larger marine animals like sharks. They do this by using a specialized dorsal fin, which acts like a suction cup, allowing them to hitch a ride and benefit from the protection and leftover food that the larger animal provides. Option (A) is incorrect because sharks do not attach themselves to other sharks. Option (C) is incorrect because jellyfish are not known to attach to sharks.
