The most likely item to rot would be a living tree, as it is made of organic matter and would naturally decompose over time. Option (C) is the correct answer. \n\nOption (A) states that a felled tree rots. This makes sense because once a tree is cut down, it is no longer receiving nutrients and water from its roots, leading to its eventual decay. \n\nOption (B) states that a stone pile rots. This is incorrect because stone is not organic matter and therefore cannot rot. \n\nOption (D) states that a pile of sand rots. This is also incorrect because sand is made up of inorganic minerals and does not have the ability to decompose."
