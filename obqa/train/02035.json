Dolphins use echolocation, a process that involves emitting high-frequency sounds and listening for the echoes to navigate and locate objects, including their prey. Dolphins use echolocation to hunt for tasty morsels, referring to the food they eat. Option (A) is incorrect because dolphins do not use echolocation to hunt for Santa Claus. Option (B) is not accurate as dolphins primarily hunt for fish and other marine creatures, not school children. Option (D) is a metaphorical answer and not related to the actual hunting behavior of dolphins."
