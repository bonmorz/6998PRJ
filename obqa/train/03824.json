Plants require water for their survival and if there is less liquid (water) available, their population will decrease. Option (A) is incorrect because cutting down plants does not directly affect their population, it only affects their numbers in a specific area. Option (B) is not always true because some plants actually rely on certain methods of interaction with animals, such as pollination for reproduction. Option (C) is also not always true because while rabbits may avoid eating certain plants, it does not necessarily guarantee the survival or growth of the plant population."
