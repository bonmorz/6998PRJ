Lava is molten rock that is extremely hot, typically between 700 to 1,200 degrees Celsius (1,300 to 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit). If a cat's body were immersed in lava, the high temperature of the lava would quickly transfer heat to the cat's body, causing its body temperature to increase rapidly. Option (A) is incorrect because apple juice is not a particularly hot substance and would not significantly affect the cat's body temperature. Option (C) is incorrect because liquid nitrogen is extremely cold, typically around -196 degrees Celsius (-321 degrees Fahrenheit), and would cause the cat's body temperature to drop significantly. Option (D) is incorrect because water is typically not hot enough to significantly increase a cat's body temperature. Lava is the only option that is both extremely hot and capable of increasing a cat's body temperature."
