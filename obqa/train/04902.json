Sedimentary rocks are formed from the accumulation and compression of sediment over time. Fossils are often found preserved in sedimentary rocks, so it is likely that a sedimentary rock would hold a trilobyte, an extinct marine arthropod. Option (B) is incorrect because sedimentary rocks do not typically hold cookies. Option (C) is incorrect because sedimentary rocks are not associated with wheatgrass shakes. Option (D) is incorrect because a diner is a type of restaurant and not something that would be found within a sedimentary rock."
