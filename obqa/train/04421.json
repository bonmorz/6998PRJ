When a warm glass is placed in the fridge, it will begin to cool down. As it cools, the air inside the fridge will come into contact with the colder glass and condensate, forming droplets of water on the surface of the glass. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) condensate. Option (A) is incorrect because a warm glass placed in the fridge will not emit light or glow. Option (C) is incorrect because the glass itself will not shrink due to being placed in the fridge. Option (D) is incorrect because unless there is a significant temperature difference and thermal shock, the glass should not crack from being placed in the fridge."
