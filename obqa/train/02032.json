Plant roots are responsible for absorbing water, nutrients, and minerals from the soil and transporting them to other parts of the plant, including the buds where new growth occurs. Option (A) is incorrect because plants do not move things to the dirt, they extract nutrients from the dirt. Option (B) is incorrect because plants do not move things to the sky, they absorb light and carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves. Option (C) is incorrect because \"plasma\" typically refers to the fluid component of blood and is not relevant to plant physiology."
