Whales are warm-blooded mammals and have a thick layer of blubber that helps to insulate and retain heat, allowing them to keep warm in frigid water. Option (A) is incorrect because while squirrels can regulate their body temperature to some extent, their small size and lack of insulating layers make them more susceptible to changes in temperature. Option (C) is incorrect because chihuahuas are small dogs with less body mass and insulation compared to larger dogs. Option (D) is incorrect because while cats are warm-blooded, their body size and lack of insulating layers make it more challenging for them to retain heat compared to a whale."

Therefore, they are excellent at keeping themselves warm even in frigid seas.\n\nOption (C) states a chihuahua. Chihuahuas are small breed dogs and tend to have less body mass and a higher surface area to volume ratio, which makes them susceptible to losing body heat. While they can regulate their temperature through shivering or seeking heat sources, they are not as efficient in retaining heat compared to larger animals.\n\nOption (D) states a cat. Cats are warm-blooded animals and can regulate their body temperature to an extent. They have fur to provide insulation and can curl up to conserve body heat. However, they do not possess an extensive layer of blubber like whales, which limits their ability to retain heat as effectively. \n\nBased on these explanations, option (B) - a whale - is the most likely animal to keep itself warmest."

To counteract the loss of heat in their aquatic environment, they have a thick insulating layer of blubber. Blubber acts as a layer of insulation, keeping the whale's body temperature stable. It also provides buoyancy and energy storage.\n\nOn the other hand, the other animals listed do not have the same level of insulation as whales. Squirrels, chihuahuas, and cats have fur/ hair to provide some level of insulation, but it is not as effective as blubber.
