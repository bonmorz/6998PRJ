When scraping the side of a cliff, it is most likely that sand will be produced. Cliffs are often made up of sedimentary rocks, which can be easily weathered and broken down into sand particles. Option (A) is incorrect because ice is not typically found on the surface of a cliff unless it is in a very cold climate. Option (B) is also incorrect because snow is a form of precipitation and does not typically form on the surface of a cliff. Option (D) is incorrect because wood chips are not naturally found on the surface of cliffs."
