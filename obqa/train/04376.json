Foxes, as carnivores, primarily rely on other animals as their food source. Option (A) is incorrect because the presence or absence of wolves does not directly impact the abundance of foxes. Option (B) is unrelated to the dietary habits or population dynamics of foxes. Option (C) is also incorrect because foxes are carnivores, meaning they eat other animals, not plants. Option (D) is the correct answer because if the plants have died, the rabbits and mice in the area, which are primary prey for foxes, would have lost their food source. Consequently, this would lead to a decrease in the population of rabbits and mice, which further reduces the availability of food for foxes, making them less abundant."
