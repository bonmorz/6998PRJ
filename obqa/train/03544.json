Chlorophyll is a pigment found in plants, including roses, that absorbs sunlight and converts it into energy through the process of photosynthesis. Option (A) is incorrect because chlorophyll does not have the ability to change the color of roses. Option (C) is incorrect because chlorophyll is involved in the production of oxygen, not the conversion of oxygen into carbon dioxide. Option (D) is incorrect because chlorophyll's primary function is not to take in dust particles from the air, but to absorb sunlight for energy."
