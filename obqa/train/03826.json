In the food chain, animals that consume producers (such as plants) are known as consumers. These consumers eat producers for sustenance, which refers to their source of nourishment or food. Option (A) is incorrect because it only mentions one specific type of producer (grass) and does not encompass all producers. Option (B) is incorrect because it only mentions one specific ecosystem (the sea) and does not encompass all ecosystems. Option (C) is incorrect because it mentions a natural phenomenon (water flow) that is not directly related to the food chain."
