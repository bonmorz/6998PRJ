Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are derived from the remains of living organisms that have been buried and subjected to heat and pressure over millions of years. These materials react with other substances to deliver energy when they are burned. However, they are a finite resource that is being depleted at a faster rate than they are being formed. Option (A) is incorrect because the burning of fossil fuels contributes to environmental issues such as air pollution and climate change. Option (C) is false because fossil fuels are not infinite and will eventually run out. Option (D) is incorrect because fossil fuels are widely used as a source of energy in various sectors around the world."

Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are derived from the remains of living organisms, such as dead plants and animals, that lived millions of years ago. These materials react with other substances, such as oxygen, to release energy when burned. However, the burning of fossil fuels also releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change and environmental degradation. Therefore, fossil fuels are a resource that is being depleted and their use has negative consequences for the environment. Option (A) is incorrect because fossil fuels have a negative impact on the environment. Option (C) is false because fossil fuels are a finite resource and will eventually run out.
