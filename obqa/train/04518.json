When a cardinal makes brief contact with a picnic table, there is likely to be abrasion between them. Abrasion refers to a scraping or rubbing against a surface, which can occur when the cardinal comes into contact with the table. Option (A) is incorrect because brief contact with a picnic table is unlikely to result in death. Option (B) is also incorrect because transactions imply an exchange or interaction, which is not the case in this scenario. Option (C) is not supported by the information given and assumes animosity between the cardinal and the picnic table, which is unlikely."

Option (A) is incorrect because brief contact with a picnic table would not result in death.
