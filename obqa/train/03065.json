While all the options listed can have some impact on the environment, the biggest factor in climate change is generally considered to be human activities, particularly the emissions of greenhouse gases caused by factories and other industrial sources. Option (A) is incorrect because while bees play a crucial role in pollination, their impact on climate change is minimal compared to human activities. Option (B) is incorrect because while melting glaciers contribute to rising sea levels, they are not the primary driver of climate change. Option (C) is incorrect because while using bicycles instead of cars can reduce carbon emissions, it is not the biggest factor in climate change."
