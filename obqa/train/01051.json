Basic knowledge about the principles of evolution and natural selection is required to answer this question. Animals that are able to adapt to changing environments and circumstances are more likely to thrive and survive, while those that are unable to adapt may go extinct. Option (A) is incorrect because the type of animal alone does not determine its survival. Option (B) is incorrect because the ability to conform is not necessarily related to survival. Option (C) is incorrect because the ability to stay in one place does not necessarily determine survival."

Animals that thrive and survive are typically those that can adapt to their changing environment. They have the ability to adjust their behavior, physiology, and anatomy to better suit their surroundings. This allows them to overcome challenges, find food and shelter, and reproduce successfully. Option (A) is incorrect because different types of animals can both thrive and go extinct depending on their ability to adapt. Option (B) is incorrect because the ability to conform is not the determining factor for an animal's survival. Option (C) is incorrect because staying in one place may limit an animal's ability to find resources or escape from threats."

This is because animals that can adapt to changes in their environment have a better chance of survival and reproduction, while those that cannot adapt may struggle to find food, evade predators, or cope with other environmental changes. Option (A) is too general and does not highlight a specific characteristic that separates thriving and extinct animals. Option (B) suggests that animals that go extinct lack the ability to conform, but this is not a key factor in their extinction. Option (C) implies that animals that stay in one place are more likely to thrive, but this is not necessarily true."

Option (B) suggests a lack of ability to conform as the differentiating factor, which is not supported by evidence. Option (C) is incorrect because the ability to stay in one place does not necessarily determine an animal's ability to thrive or go extinct, as some animals have evolved to migrate."
