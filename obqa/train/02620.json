When the sun falls on mountains and deserts at the same time, it heats up the surfaces, which leads to the creation of temperature gradients. These temperature gradients generate convection currents in the air, resulting in the movement of hot air upwards and the cooler air replacing it. This convection can create unstable atmospheric conditions and potentially lead to the formation of storms or other weather phenomena. Option (A) is unrelated to the effects of the sun on mountains and deserts. Option (C) is incorrect because the sun's heat does not directly cause earthquakes.
