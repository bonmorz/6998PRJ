A suit of armor is typically made of metal and is heavy. As such, it can easily pull or attract objects that are lightweight and have magnetic properties. \n\nOption (A) suggests a stick, which is typically made of wood and does not have magnetic properties. So, a suit of armor would not be able to easily pull a stick towards it.\n\nOption (B) suggests a paper leaflet, which is very lightweight but does not have magnetic properties. Therefore, a suit of armor would not be able to easily attract or pull a paper leaflet towards it.\n\nOption (D) suggests a wooden cog, which is also made of wood and does not have magnetic properties. Therefore, a suit of armor would not be able to easily pull a wooden cog towards it.\n\nOption (C) suggests a fridge decoration, which is often made of lightweight materials such as plastic or magnets. These materials can have magnetic properties, allowing them to be easily attracted or pulled towards a suit of armor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C), a fridge decoration, as it is the only object in the options that a suit of armor can easily pull towards it."
