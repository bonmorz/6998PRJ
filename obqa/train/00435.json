Arctic animals often live on ice because the Arctic regions are characterized by cold temperatures and an abundance of ice, such as glaciers, icebergs, and sea ice. Option (B) is incorrect because the soil in the Arctic regions is typically frozen and not suitable for most animals to live on. Option (C) is incorrect because liquid water in the Arctic is typically found in the form of seas and oceans, which are not suitable habitats for most arctic animals. Option (D) is incorrect because the vegetation in the Arctic is scarce and limited to hardy plants that can survive in the extreme cold conditions."
