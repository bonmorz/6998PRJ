In unusually hot and dry places, such as deserts, the animal that is most likely to thrive is the fennec fox. Fennec foxes are adapted to living in desert environments and have several special features that help them survive. They have large ears, which help them dissipate heat and stay cool, and they have fur that helps insulate them from the extreme desert temperatures. Jellyfish (option A) are marine animals and cannot survive in hot and dry environments. Arctic foxes (option B) and polar bears (option D) are adapted to cold environments, not hot and dry ones."
