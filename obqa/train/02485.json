Option (A), a rock, does not require sunlight to grow as rocks are non-living entities. Option (B), a cat, does not rely on sunlight for its growth as cats are mammals and obtain their energy and nutrients from food. Option (D), a bird, does not directly require sunlight for growth as birds rely on food for energy and growth.\n\nOption (C), a bamboo stalk, is the correct answer as bamboo is a plant that undergoes photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process is essential for the growth and development of plants. Therefore, a bamboo stalk directly requires sunlight to grow."
