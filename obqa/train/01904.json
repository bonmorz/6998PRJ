A sandbar is a submerged or partially exposed ridge of sand or sediment that is typically located in the shallow portion of a body of water, such as a river or ocean. Option (A) is incorrect because there is no direct relation between the presence of a sandbar and the water being bloody. Option (B) is incorrect because the hardness of water has no impact on the formation of a sandbar. Option (C) is incorrect because the presence of a sandbar does not indicate that the water is falling. Option (D) is the correct answer because the presence of a sandbar is a result of the water adjusting and depositing sediment in a specific area due to factors such as waves, currents, and tides."

Option (D) correctly states that the water adjusts things, referring to the way water currents can shape and move sediment, forming sandbars. Options (A), (B), and (C) are unrelated to the characteristics or formation of sandbars. Option (A) is a false statement, as the presence of blood in the water has no correlation to the formation of sandbars. Option (B) implies that the water becomes physically harder, which is not true. Option (C) suggests a falling motion of water, which is not related to sandbars."
