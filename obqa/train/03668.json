Option (D) is the correct answer because dumpyards, which are also known as landfills or dumpsites, have a significant negative impact on the environment. Landfills can lead to pollution of air, soil, and water through the release of toxic substances and greenhouse gases. They also contribute to the depletion of natural resources and can be a source of contamination if not properly managed.\n\nOptions (A) and (B), plants and trees, are incorrect because they have a positive impact on the environment. Plants and trees play a crucial role in carbon dioxide absorption, oxygen production, and providing habitats for animals. They also help prevent soil erosion and control water runoff.\n\nOption (C), recycling, is also incorrect. Recycling is a process that helps reduce waste, conserve resources, and decrease pollution. It is considered a positive environmental practice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) dumpyards, which have a negative impact on the environment."

They absorb carbon dioxide, release oxygen, provide habitats for animals, and help to prevent soil erosion. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect.\n\nRecycling (option C) is also generally considered to have a positive impact on the environment. By recycling materials, we reduce the need for extracting and processing raw resources, which helps to conserve natural resources and reduce pollution. Option C is incorrect.\n\nDumpyards (option D), on the other hand, can have a negative impact on the environment. Dumpyards, also known as landfills, are areas where waste is disposed of and buried. Landfills can release harmful gases, such as methane, which contribute to climate change. They can also contaminate soil and groundwater if proper waste management practices are not followed. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
