Human logging activities often result in deforestation and habitat loss for many animals. As a result, some animals have to conserve their food supply because their natural sources of food may have been destroyed or diminished. Option (A) is incorrect as animals do not typically need to conserve air. Option (B) is also not directly related to the impact of logging activities. Option (C) may be true in some cases, as animals may need to adapt their mobility due to habitat loss, but it is not the most directly impacted by logging."
