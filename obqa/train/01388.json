Option (C) is correct because electricity is what provides the power needed for the light bulb to produce light. Option (A) is incorrect because turning on the light switch is what completes the circuit and allows the electricity to flow to the light bulb. Option (D) is incorrect because screwing in the light bulb only ensures that it is securely connected to the socket, but it does not directly cause it to light up. Option (B) is also incorrect because simply placing the light bulb on a shelf does not have any effect on whether it will be lit up or not."
