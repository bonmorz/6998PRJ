A magnifying glass is a convex lens that is used to make objects appear larger and clearer by bending and focusing light rays. Option (A) is correct because a magnifying glass would allow the user to better view the legs on an ant by magnifying and enlarging the image. Option (B) is incorrect because a magnifying glass does not affect the sense of smell. Option (C) is incorrect because a magnifying glass does not blur the image, but rather focuses and magnifies it.
