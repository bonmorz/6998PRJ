Trees play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems by providing habitat, regulating temperature, and supporting biodiversity. Removing trees can cause damage to ecosystems such as jungles because it disrupts the delicate relationships between different species and can lead to habitat loss, increased soil erosion, and a decrease in overall biodiversity. Options (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect because while tree removal can have an impact on cities, fields, and oceans, it is the jungles or forests that are most directly affected by this action."
