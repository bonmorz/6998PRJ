When zero people choose to buy more beads, it means that the seller is not making any sales. Therefore, the seller will have stalled income because they are not earning any money from the sales of beads. Option (A) is incorrect because making more money implies that there are sales, which is not the case in this scenario. Option (C) is incorrect because increasing profits would require selling more beads, which is not happening in this scenario. Option (D) is incorrect because having more income implies generating more sales, which is not the case here."

However, if zero people choose to buy more beads, it means that no additional sales are being made. Therefore, the seller's income would stall because there are no new sales generating revenue. Option (A) is incorrect because if no one is buying more beads, the seller cannot make more money. Option (C) is also incorrect because increasing profits would require an increase in sales or revenue, which is not happening in this scenario. Option (D) is misleading because more income implies an increase in revenue, which is not the case when zero people choose to buy more beads. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) - the seller will have stalled income."
