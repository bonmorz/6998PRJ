Reproduction involves the production of gametes (sperm and eggs) and the ability to engage in sexual intercourse or reproductive behaviors. Option (A) is incorrect because infancy refers to the very early stage of life and does not involve reproductive abilities. Option (B) is incorrect because childhood refers to a period of time before puberty and the development of reproductive abilities. Option (C) is incorrect because youth is a broad term that does not specifically indicate physical readiness for reproduction."
