The girl should use log portions to build her house because logs come from trees, which are a renewable resource. Trees can be replanted and grown again, making them a sustainable material for construction. Option (A) is incorrect because glass shards are not a renewable resource. Option (B) is incorrect because rubber pipes are not a traditional material for building houses and are not typically considered a renewable resource. Option (D) is incorrect because plastic spoons are not a suitable material for building a house and they are not a renewable resource."

Renewable resources are natural resources that can be replenished or replaced within a relatively short period of time. Option (C) is the correct answer because logs can be harvested from forests, and as long as responsible logging practices are followed, new trees can be planted to replace the ones that were cut down. This makes logs a renewable resource for building houses. \n\nOptions (A), (B), and (D) are not renewable resources. Glass shards are not a renewable resource because they are made from sand, which takes millions of years to form naturally. Rubber pipes are also not renewable resources because they are made from synthetic materials derived from petroleum, which is a non-renewable resource. Plastic spoons are made from petroleum-based plastics and are also not a renewable resource."

Option (C), log portions, would be the most appropriate choice as logs can be obtained from sustainably managed forests and can be replenished over time through proper forestry practices. Option (A), glass shards, is incorrect because glass is not renewable as it is made from finite resources such as sand and other minerals. Option (B), rubber pipes, is also incorrect because rubber is made from the sap of rubber trees, which are also a finite resource. Option (D), plastic spoons, is made from petroleum, a non-renewable resource."
