Option (A), the rabbit, is not known for its camouflage abilities and would not hide effectively. Option (C), the cat, may be able to hide to some extent, but is not specifically known for its camouflage abilities. Option (D), the spider, may be able to hide in certain environments, but it is not as well-known for camouflage as the chameleon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B), the chameleon. Chameleons have the unique ability to change the color of their skin to blend in with their surroundings, making them excellent at hiding when seeking food. They can match the color and pattern of the objects around them, making it difficult for predators or prey to spot them."
