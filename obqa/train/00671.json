Evaporation is the process of water turning into vapor and rising into the atmosphere. The reverse of evaporation, where vapor turns back into liquid water, is known as condensation. However, the question asks for the specific weather phenomenon that is the reverse of evaporation. That phenomenon is precipitation, which is when condensed water vapor falls from the atmosphere as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Option (A) is incorrect because cloud formation is a result of condensation, not the reverse of evaporation. Option (C) is incorrect because transpiration is the process by which plants release water vapor into the atmosphere, not the reverse of evaporation."

The reverse of evaporation is when a gas changes into a liquid due to the removal of heat energy, and this process is called condensation. Option (B) is the correct answer because condensation is the reverse of evaporation in terms of weather phenomena.\n\nOption (A), cloud formation, is related to condensation. When water vapor in the air cools and condenses, it forms clouds.\n\nOption (C), transpiration, refers to the process by which plants release water vapor through their leaves. It is not directly related to the reverse of evaporation in terms of weather phenomena.\n\nOption (D), precipitation, refers to any form of water that falls from the atmosphere to the Earth's surface. While it is related to the water cycle, it is not the reverse of evaporation as it involves the formation of liquid or solid water particles from the condensation process."

When water vapor in the atmosphere cools and condenses, it forms clouds. This is the opposite of evaporation, as evaporation is the process by which liquid water turns into water vapor.

The reverse of evaporation occurs when the condensed water droplets in the clouds come together to form larger droplets that are heavy enough to fall from the atmosphere as precipitation, such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Option (B) is incorrect because condensation is actually a stage that occurs during the reverse of evaporation, as mentioned earlier.
