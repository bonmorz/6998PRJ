Our planet, Earth, spins on its axis, which is an imaginary line passing through the North and South poles. This rotation causes day and night. The Earth also orbits around the sun, completing one orbit in approximately 365.25 days. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) the sun. Options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect as Pluto is no longer considered a planet, the moon orbits around the Earth, not the other way around, and the Milky Way is a galaxy, not a celestial body that the Earth revolves around."

Our planet, Earth, spins or rotates on its axis, and the axis itself is tilted at an angle. The sun is at the center of our solar system, and all the planets, including Earth, orbit around it. Option (A) is incorrect because Pluto is no longer considered a planet. Option (B) is incorrect because while the moon does have an influence on Earth's tides, it is not the central body that Earth orbits around. Option (C) is incorrect because the Milky Way is a galaxy, and Earth is just one of many planets within it."
