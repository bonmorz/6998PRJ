Producers, such as plants, are capable of producing their own sustenance through the process of photosynthesis. They convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose, which provides energy for their own growth and survival. Option (A) is incorrect because producers do not produce air. Option (B) is partially correct as plants, which are producers, often include grass, but it is too specific. Option (C) is incorrect as producers do not produce their own bodies, they grow and develop them. Option (D) is the most accurate answer as it encompasses the idea of producers producing their own sustenance for survival."

In ecology, a producer refers to an organism that is capable of producing its own food through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. This is typically done by converting sunlight or inorganic compounds into organic matter. Option (D) is the correct answer because \"sustenance\" refers to food or nourishment, and producers create their own nourishment through the synthesis of organic matter. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because producers do not produce air, which is primarily produced through processes such as respiration and photosynthesis by other organisms. \n\nOption (B) is also incorrect because while grass can be a type of producer (specifically, a type of plant), not all producers necessarily produce grass. \n\nOption (C) is incorrect because while some producers may have their own bodies (such as plants), this is not a defining characteristic of being a producer, and many producers are single-celled organisms that do not have a distinct body structure."
