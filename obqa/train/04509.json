Milk sold in supermarkets is pasteurized to keep bacteria from getting into the milk after the customer buys it. Pasteurization is a process of heating the milk to kill harmful bacteria and prolong its shelf life.

Option (C) is partially correct, as factory-farmed cows can have a higher risk of producing milk with contaminants, but it is not the main reason for pasteurization. Option (D) is incorrect because pasteurization is primarily done for safety reasons, not for taste improvement."
