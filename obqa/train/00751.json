Option (A) is correct because chlorophyll is the pigment that gives plants their green color, so it would avoid being pinched on St. Patrick's day, a holiday associated with wearing green. Option (B) is incorrect because chlorophyll would stand out in the arctic, which is predominantly white. Option (C) and (D) are also incorrect because chlorophyll does not relate to the color of a person's cheeks or emotions."
