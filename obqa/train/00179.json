This is why they are often attracted to food that is rotting or decomposing. Options (B), (C), and (D) are all related to unpleasant smells, but they do not specifically address the ability of flies to find food. Option (A) is the correct answer because flies can detect the smell of decaying organisms, which often indicates the presence of a food source."
