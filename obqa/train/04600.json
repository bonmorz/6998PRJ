Option (C) is the correct answer because the special straws are likely designed to treat water, making it safe for drinking.

Based on common knowledge and context clues, the most likely reason philanthropists would donate special straws is to treat water. In many impoverished countries, access to clean and safe drinking water is limited. Special straws, such as those with built-in filters or purifiers, can help remove harmful contaminants from water sources and make it safe for consumption. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because if the straws were polluting water, it wouldn't make sense for philanthropists to donate them to help poor countries. Option (B) is also incorrect because the fact that poor countries may need straws is not a valid reason for philanthropists to donate them. Option (D) is incorrect because if the straws were poisoning water, it would be counterproductive and harmful to the people in those countries."

The context suggests that these straws are meant to help poor countries.

Option (B) can also be eliminated because needing straws does not explain why philanthropists would donate them specifically. Option (D) can be eliminated because it states that the straws poison water, which again goes against the idea of providing assistance. This leaves us with option (C) - they treat water. This makes sense because special straws can potentially be used to filter or purify water, making it safe for people in poor countries to drink. Therefore, philanthropists donate these straws to help improve access to clean and safe drinking water in impoverished areas."

Option (D) is also incorrect as philanthropists typically want to provide resources that improve the well-being of others, not harm them.\n\nThe correct answer, (C), is that the special straws are used to treat water. This means that the straws have a filtration or purification mechanism, allowing individuals in poor countries to have access to clean and safe drinking water. This is crucial in areas where clean water sources are scarce or contaminated. Therefore, the philanthropists are donating the straws to help improve the health and quality of life for people in these countries."
