For example, if the water is too hot, it can scald the baby's skin. However, generally speaking, baths are considered safe for babies when supervised and appropriate safety measures are implemented, such as using a baby bathtub and ensuring the water temperature is suitable.\n\nOption (B), a pacifier, is not likely to cause any significant injury to a baby when used properly. Pacifiers are designed to be safe for infants and are generally made of baby-friendly materials. However, it is important to regularly check the pacifier for any signs of wear or damage and to ensure it is an appropriate size for the baby to prevent choking hazards.\n\nOption (C), a bottle, is also not likely to cause injury to a baby when used properly. However, if a bottle is used incorrectly, for example, by propping it up and leaving the baby unattended, it can increase the risk of choking or aspiration. Care should be taken to hold the baby during bottle-feeding and to ensure the nipple size is suitable for the baby's age to prevent feeding difficulties.\n\nOption (D), a wasp, is the most likely to cause injury to a baby. Wasps can sting and potentially cause an allergic reaction or a painful reaction in babies. It is important to keep babies away from wasps and other insects that may pose a risk.\n\nBased on the analysis of each option, it is evident that option (D), a wasp, is the most likely to cause injury to a baby."
