This is because when cars are recycled, the metal from the old cars can be reused to make new products, reducing the need for extracting and processing new metal ores. Option (A) is incorrect because recycling old cars does not directly impact the weather. Option (C) is unrelated to recycling old cars. Option (D) is partially correct, as recycling old cars can contribute to the economy through job creation and the generation of revenue, but it is not the most specific and accurate answer to the question."
