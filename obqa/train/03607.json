In order to notice a bat flying towards you, you need eyes and reflected sunlight. Bats are nocturnal animals and are difficult to see in the dark. However, when sunlight or other bright light sources reflect off their wings, it creates contrast and makes them visible to our eyes. Option (A) is incorrect because having a hand and an arm is not necessary for perceiving a bat flying towards you. Option (C) is incorrect because dogs and scared cats are not directly related to perceiving a bat. Option (D) is incorrect because a nose and eyebrows are not specifically required for perceiving a bat flying towards you."

In order to notice a bat flying towards you, you need to have eyes and reflected sunlight. Bats are nocturnal animals and are typically active at night when there is limited natural light. Therefore, they rely on echolocation to navigate and find prey. They emit high-frequency sounds that bounce off objects and back to their ears, allowing them to determine the location of objects in their environment. However, because humans cannot hear these high-frequency sounds, we rely on our vision during the day or artificial lighting at night to see bats flying towards us. Option (A) is incorrect because having a hand and an arm is not necessary for noticing a bat. Option (C) is irrelevant because dogs and cats have different sensory abilities than humans when it comes to detecting bats. Option (D) is also irrelevant because a nose and eyebrows do not play a role in noticing a bat flying towards you."
