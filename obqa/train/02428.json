However, they can also adapt to other environments like neighborhoods, where they may find suitable hiding places and a sufficient food supply. Option (A) is incorrect because grass snakes are not typically found in jungles. Option (B) is incorrect because they prefer areas with more moisture. Option (C) is the correct answer as it represents a suitable habitat for a grass snake."
