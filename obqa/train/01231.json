Warm-blooded animals, such as mammals like foxes, maintain a constant body temperature through internal heat production. Option (A) is incorrect because birds are warm-blooded and also require a warm body temperature for survival. Option (B) is incorrect because snakes are cold-blooded and do not require a warm body temperature for survival. Option (D) is incorrect because sharks are cold-blooded and do not require a warm body temperature for survival. Option (C) is the correct answer because foxes, being warm-blooded, require a warm body temperature for survival even in snowy conditions."
