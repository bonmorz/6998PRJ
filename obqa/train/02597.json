If someone is blind, they can use their hands to feel the shape of objects, including the shape of someone's nose like Tom's. Option (A) is incorrect because the color of someone's eyes cannot be determined by touch. Option (B) is also incorrect because the color of the sky cannot be determined by touch. Option (C) is incorrect because the color of someone's hair cannot be determined by touch."

While they may not be able to see it, they can still use their hands to gather information about its shape and form. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer."
