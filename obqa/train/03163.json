Echolocation is a process used by animals to detect objects in their environment by emitting sounds and then listening for the echoes that bounce back. The animals use the echoes to determine the location, size, and shape of objects. The correct answer is (D) screeching because animals that use echolocation produce specific sounds, such as clicks or screeches, which bounce off objects and return as echoes. Options (A) smell, (B) vision, and (C) sight are incorrect because echolocation relies solely on the sense of hearing, not smell, vision, or sight."
