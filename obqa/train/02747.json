Pedaling forward refers to riding a bicycle, which is a form of transportation that does not emit any pollutants. Bicycles are environmentally friendly and do not contribute to air or noise pollution. This makes option (B) the correct answer.\n\nOption (C) states that driving cars can cause pollution. Cars emit greenhouse gases and pollutants that contribute to air pollution. This makes option (C) a possible cause of pollution.\n\nOption (D) states that smoking cigarettes can cause pollution. Cigarette smoke contains harmful chemicals and pollutants that contribute to air pollution. This makes option (D) a possible cause of pollution.\n\nBased on the explanations above, option (B) is the least likely to cause pollution as it does not contribute to any form of pollution."
