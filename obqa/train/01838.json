Option (A) suggests planting different crops in alternating years, which is known as crop rotation. Crop rotation helps prevent the buildup of pests and diseases specific to one crop and maintains soil fertility. This can lead to improved production in future yields.\n\nOption (B), chemical fertilizers and salts, may provide nutrients to the plants but can harm the soil over time and negatively impact the environment. It is not considered the best and sustainable method for improving production in the long term.\n\nOption (C), rotating water schedules daily, may help with proper irrigation but does not address other factors that affect production, such as soil health, pests, and diseases.\n\nOption (D), over watering each field, is detrimental to plant health as it can lead to root rot, nutrient leaching, and encourage the growth of weeds. Overwatering does not promote productive growth and can harm plants.\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of sustainable agriculture, option (A) is the best way to improve production in future yields on the farm."

Option (A) is the correct answer because planting different crops in alternating years helps improve production in future yields. This is because different crops have different nutrient requirements, and rotating crops helps prevent depletion of specific nutrients in the soil. Option (B) is incorrect because while chemical fertilizers can provide nutrients to the plants, they may not be the best way to improve long-term production and can have negative effects on the environment. Option (C) is incorrect because rotating water schedules daily does not necessarily improve production and may lead to inconsistent watering which can be harmful to the crops.

This is a technique called crop rotation, which is a common practice in agriculture. Crop rotation helps to reduce pests and diseases in the soil, improves soil fertility, and prevents the depletion of specific nutrients. By alternating the crops, different nutrient demands are placed on the soil each year, allowing for a more sustainable and productive farming system. \n\nOption (B) suggests using chemical fertilizers and salts. While chemical fertilizers can provide nutrients to the plants, they do not address the long-term health of the soil and can lead to nutrient imbalances and environmental pollution. Option (C) suggests rotating water schedules daily. While proper irrigation is important for plant growth, rotating water schedules daily may not necessarily improve production in future yields. It is more important to consider factors such as soil moisture levels, plant water requirements, and efficient irrigation techniques. \n\nOption (D) suggests over watering each field. Over watering can lead to nutrient leaching, soil erosion, and water wastage. This can harm the plants and ultimately decrease production. Therefore, option (A) is the best answer as it promotes sustainable farming practices and helps maintain soil health for improved production in future yields."
