Skunks are known for warding off predators by releasing a noxious spray from their scent glands. This spray has a strong and unpleasant odor that acts as a deterrent to potential attackers. Option (B) is incorrect because skunks do not have a bad taste, rather it is their spray that is unpleasant. Option (C) is incorrect because while skunks have a strong sense of smell, it does not play a role in warding off predators. Option (D) is incorrect because skunks actually have a very strong and distinct odor, which is used as a defense mechanism."
