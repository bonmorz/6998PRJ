A laser produces a highly concentrated and focused light source that can be used in various applications, such as medical procedures, cutting materials, and even playing with felines. The light emitted by a laser pointer, for example, can capture a cat's attention and provide stimulation. Options (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect because they do not align with the typical uses of lasers."
