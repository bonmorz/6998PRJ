This is because the moon follows a monthly lunar cycle, going through its phases (new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous, third quarter, and waning crescent) in about 29.5 days. So, on average, the moon rises and sets once a day, leading to approximately 7 moonrise occurrences in a week. Option (A) is incorrect because the moon rising occurs more frequently than once in a decade. Option (B) is too frequent because the moon does not rise and set four times a year. Option (D) is incorrect because the moon rises and sets more frequently than once a month."
