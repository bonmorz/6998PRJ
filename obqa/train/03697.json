Beavers use their sense organs, such as their sense of smell and their keen sense of hearing, to find something to munch on with. Option (A) is incorrect because beavers do not have antennas. Option (B) is partially correct because beavers do use their teeth to munch on things, but this is not what they use to find food initially.
