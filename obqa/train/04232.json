One of the factors that affects lift is the size of the bird. \n\nSparrows are generally smaller birds compared to vultures. Smaller birds have lighter body weights, which means they require less lift to stay in the air. They also have smaller wingspans, which allows for more maneuverability, agility, and grace in flight. \n\nOn the other hand, vultures are larger birds with bigger bodies and wingspans. Due to their larger size, they need more lift to stay airborne. Their flight may appear less graceful compared to sparrows because they rely on soaring instead of quick and agile movements. \n\nOption (A) mental capacity and option (B) will power are unrelated to the mechanism of lift and flight in birds. Option (C) feather color does not have a direct impact on lift or flight abilities. Therefore, option (D) size is the correct answer as it directly relates to the difference in lift and flight grace between sparrows and vultures."
