Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, specifically green plants, convert sunlight into energy-rich molecules (such as glucose) that can be used as food.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because ants are not capable of photosynthesis. Ants are heterotrophs, which means they obtain their food by consuming organic matter, including other organisms or plant materials produced through photosynthesis.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect because dogs, like ants, are not capable of photosynthesis. Dogs are also heterotrophs and obtain their food by consuming other organisms or plant materials.\n\nOption (C) is again incorrect because gorillas, like ants and dogs, are not capable of photosynthesis. Gorillas are herbivores and obtain their food by consuming plants or parts of plants that have gone through photosynthesis.\n\nOption (D) is the correct answer because palm trees, specifically the leaves of palm trees, are capable of photosynthesis. Palm trees are green plants and have chlorophyll, which allows them to capture sunlight and convert it into food through photosynthesis. Therefore, they are able to obtain their food from photosynthesis."
