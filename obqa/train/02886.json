It has geological features that indicate the presence of water in the past and potentially in the present. Therefore, option (C) is not the least important.\n\nThis leaves us with option (B) - Pluto. Pluto used to be classified as the ninth planet in our solar system, but it was reclassified as a \"dwarf planet\" in 2006. Since then, our understanding of the solar system has changed, and Pluto is no longer considered on the same level as the other planets. It is much smaller and has less impact on the overall dynamics of the solar system.
