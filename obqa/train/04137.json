Option (A) is considered a fossil because it is a preserved bone from a mammoth, even though it has been replaced by minerals and turned into rock. Option (B) is also considered a fossil because it is an imprint of a sea creature preserved in a rock, indicating past life. Option (D) is a trace fossil because it is the imprint of a paw print preserved in rock. However, Option (C) is the one that would not be considered a fossil. A cave full of old drawings does not represent past life but rather artistic expressions or cultural artifacts."
