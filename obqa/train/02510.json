Nutrients provide the necessary fuel and building blocks for growth, development, and maintaining bodily functions. Option (A) is incorrect because taking in nutrients does not cause a kitten to break down. Option (B) is incorrect because taking in nutrients, as long as they are appropriate for the kitten's needs, will not poison it. Option (D) is incorrect because taking in nutrients does not result in sickness unless there is an underlying health issue or the nutrients are unhealthy or toxic."
