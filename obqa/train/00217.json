The mantle refers to a layer within the Earth's interior that is found between the crust and the core. It is not a planet, so option (B) is incorrect. The mantle is composed of rock, so option (C) is partially correct. However, it is more accurate to say that the mantle is a layer of the Earth rather than a specific type of rock. Option (D) is incorrect because the mantle is not the deepest part of our planet. The core, which is deeper than the mantle, holds that distinction.
