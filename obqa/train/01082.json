Excessive heat can cause materials to reach their combustion point, leading to charring, melting, or even catching fire. Option (A) is incorrect because freezing is the opposite effect and occurs when there is a lack of heat. Option (B) is incorrect because solidifying is the process of turning from a liquid to a solid, which may or may not be related to the addition of heat. Option (D) is incorrect because moving is a broad term and does not specifically relate to heat transfer."
