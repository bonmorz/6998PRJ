Light can reflect off various surfaces, but the surface that is most likely to reflect light is a bottled liquid. This is because liquids, such as water or glass, have smooth surfaces that can easily reflect light. Option (A) is incorrect because rocks can absorb and scatter light rather than reflect it. Option (C) is incorrect because sand also tends to absorb and scatter light. Option (D) is incorrect because wood usually absorbs light rather than reflecting it."
