Since wood does not conduct electricity, there would be no electrical hazard from the wooden duck being submerged in water. Therefore, the consequences of placing a wooden duck in a full bathtub are minimal.\n\nOption (C) suggests placing a toy boat in a full bathtub. Similar to the wooden duck, a toy boat does not pose an electrical hazard. The consequences of placing a toy boat in a full bathtub would involve a potential mess or water splashing out, but there are no significant dangers or worst consequences.\n\nOption (D) involves placing an unpowered toaster in a full bathtub. An unpowered toaster does not have an electrical current running through it and, therefore, would not pose an immediate electrical hazard. While there may be some potential for the toaster to fall into the water or cause complications, it is still not the worst consequence.\n\nOption (B) describes placing a powered toaster in a full bathtub. This scenario presents the highest risk and worst consequences. Electric toasters have exposed electrical heating elements that can cause electric shocks or electrocution if they come into contact with water. Placing a powered toaster in a full bathtub would create a direct electrical hazard, potentially resulting in severe injury or even death.\n\nTherefore, option (B) - a powered toaster - would result in the worst consequences if placed in a full bathtub."
