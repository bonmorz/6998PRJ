When a person wants to track the time it takes to run around a circle, they would use a stopwatch to mark the time. Option (A) is incorrect because a stopwatch does not require time, but rather measures it. Option (B) is also incorrect as the purpose of using a stopwatch is to measure time, not to enjoy it. Option (C) is partially correct, as using a stopwatch can help find the time it takes to complete the activity, but \"mark\" is a more specific term that accurately describes the action of noting or recording the time. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer."
