Solid glaciers are likely slightly larger in size than their liquid counterparts because when water freezes and turns into ice, it expands slightly in volume.

Option (A) is incorrect because solid steel will have a similar size to its liquid counterpart, as the volume of steel does not change significantly when it solidifies.

When substances transition from a liquid to a solid state, they generally become slightly larger in size. This is due to the way the molecules or particles arrange themselves in a solid, leading to a higher density and larger overall volume compared to their liquid counterparts. Solid steel, wood, and mercury (option A, B, and D) may not necessarily be larger in size when in solid form compared to their liquid form. However, solid glaciers (option C), which are formed from the freezing of water, do exhibit this property.

Solid glaciers are likely slightly larger in size than their liquid counterparts because of the phenomenon of water expansion when it freezes. When water freezes and becomes a solid (ice), it expands and takes up more space than the same volume of liquid water. This is due to the arrangement of water molecules in the solid state, which forms a specific structure that takes up more space than the more randomly arranged liquid molecules. Therefore, solid glaciers (ice) are likely slightly larger in size than an equivalent volume of liquid water. Options (A), (B), and (D) do not exhibit this expansion when they solidify, so they would not be slightly larger in size compared to their liquid counterparts."
