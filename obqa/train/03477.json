When it comes to blocking electrical shocks, it is important to use materials that do not conduct electricity well. Wood, such as a log cabin, is a poor conductor and would be the best choice for blocking a shock. Metal, on the other hand, is a good conductor and would not offer as much protection. Option (B) is incorrect because a metal plane would conduct electricity. Option (C) is incorrect because aluminum is also a good conductor. Option (D) is incorrect because a tin can is made of metal and would conduct electricity."
