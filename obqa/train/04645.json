When Rebecca saw fluid in the gutter in the morning, it was most likely water that had accumulated or flowed into the gutter, such as from rain or a spill. Throughout the day, due to exposure to sunlight and wind, the water in the gutter slowly evaporated. Evaporation is the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas, and it occurs when the water molecules gain enough energy to break free from the liquid and enter the surrounding air. Option (A) is incorrect because condensation is the process by which water vapor changes back into a liquid form, and it typically occurs when warm, moist air comes into contact with a cold surface. Option (C) is not a scientific explanation and is not related to the process of the fluid disappearing. Option (D) is incorrect because deposition is the process by which water vapor changes directly into ice without first becoming a liquid, and it is not relevant to the scenario described in the question."
