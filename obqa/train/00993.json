When two decorative items for a refrigerator are placed back to back, they will not stick together or be sticky.

Option (B) is incorrect because there is no magnetic force to cause them to stick together. Option (C) is incorrect because there is no sticky substance involved. Option (D) is incorrect because there is no electrical charge involved. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer."
