A little chameleon is the correct answer because chameleons have the remarkable ability to change their skin color to blend in with their surroundings, providing camouflage and making it difficult for predators to spot them. Option (B) is incorrect because although humans can change their appearance through clothing, hairstyles, and makeup, they cannot naturally change their appearance like a chameleon. Option (C) is incorrect because lions do not naturally change their appearance to evade capture. Option (D) is incorrect because goats do not have the ability to change their appearance for camouflage or evasion."
