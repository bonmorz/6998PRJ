Reptiles, such as turtles and snakes, are known to lay eggs in shelled containers. This allows their eggs to be protected and develop into offspring. Options (B), (C), and (D) do not align with this knowledge. Dogs do not reproduce using shelled containers, plants reproduce through other means such as pollination and seed dispersal, and the concept of \"invisible\" life forms is not defined or relevant in this context."

The question is asking about the life form that uses shelled item containers for replication processes. Option (A) states reptile, which refers to a type of animal that includes turtles, snakes, and lizards. Option (B) states dog, which is a specific type of domesticated mammal. Option (C) states plant, which refers to a type of organism that includes trees, flowers, and grass. Option (D) states invisible, which is not a specific type of life form and is not a valid answer choice. \n\nAnalyzing the options, we can eliminate option (B) because dogs do not typically use shelled item containers for replication processes. We can also eliminate option (C) because plants do not typically use shelled item containers for replication processes either. Option (D) is not a valid answer choice because \"invisible\" is not a type of life form. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) reptile, as some reptiles, such as turtles, lay their eggs in shelled containers for the purpose of reproduction and replication of their species."
