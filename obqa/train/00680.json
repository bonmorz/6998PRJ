An intoxicating drink typically involves fermentation, which is the conversion of sugars into alcohol by yeast or bacteria. Corn can be used to make alcoholic beverages such as corn whiskey or corn-based beers. A serving of pie or a stick of ice cream does not contain the necessary ingredients for fermentation. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. Option (B) is incorrect because while all of the options listed could be food items, only a cob of corn has the potential to facilitate the production of an intoxicating drink."
