Chameleons are known for their ability to change color, which allows them to blend into their surroundings and effectively disguise themselves. This is a survival mechanism that helps them evade predators or sneak up on prey. Dogs, birds, and cats do not have this same ability to change color and blend in, therefore they are less likely to be in disguise."
