Animals, like humans, have a brain and a central nervous system, which enables them to process information and make decisions. Option (B) is correct because animals make decisions based on the cognitive processes happening inside their heads. Options (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect because animals do not make decisions based on their feet, spines, or homes."
