Melting refers to the process in which solids are heated above their melting point, causing them to transition from a solid to a liquid state. Freezing, on the other hand, is the process in which solids are cooled from a liquid to a solid state. Therefore, option (A) is the most accurate statement, as it correctly describes both processes. Option (B) is incorrect because it confuses the definitions of melting and freezing. Option (C) is also incorrect because it presents an incorrect definition for freezing. Option (D) is incorrect because it presents an incorrect definition for both melting and freezing."
