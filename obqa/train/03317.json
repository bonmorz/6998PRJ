Option (B) is correct because using aluminium foil can help concentrate the sun's rays onto the cookies, allowing them to bake. Option (A) is incorrect because the sun would actually melt the ice instead of baking the cookies. Option (C) is also incorrect as blocks of ice would not contribute to the baking process.
