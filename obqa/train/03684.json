Chipmunks live in burrows in the ground, typically in a natural environment like a forest or meadow. Construction of a mall would likely involve digging up the ground and destroying their burrows, forcing the chipmunks to find a new home. Option (A) is unlikely to displace chipmunks as they can seek shelter and hold onto plants or trees to avoid being blown away by wind. Option (B) is related to sound and would not directly displace chipmunks. Option (C) is related to precipitation and would not directly displace chipmunks, although heavy rainfall may flood their burrows and force them out temporarily."
