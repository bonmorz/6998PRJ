Option (B) is the correct answer because spring changing to summer typically brings longer daylight hours, which can provide more working hours and potentially increase productivity. Option (A) is incorrect because autumn changing to winter indicates shorter daylight hours and may limit working time. Option (C) is incorrect because tree leaves falling does not have a direct impact on work length. Option (D) is also incorrect because the first snowfall does not necessarily affect work length."
