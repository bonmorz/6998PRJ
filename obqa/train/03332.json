A learned behavior is a behavior that is acquired through experience or teaching, rather than being innate or instinctual. Option (B) is the correct answer because seals clapping to the delight of an audience is not an instinctual behavior for seals, but instead, it is a behavior that they have learned to perform. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because newborn turtles crawling towards the sea is an instinctual behavior known as an innate behavior, as they have the natural instinct to head towards the water immediately after hatching.\n\nOption (C) is also incorrect because ducks sitting on their eggs is an instinctual behavior known as brooding behavior, as ducks have the instinct to incubate and care for their eggs.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because baby birds chewing worms is also an instinctual behavior known as a feeding behavior, as baby birds have the instinct to chew and consume worms for nourishment.\n\nOption (E) is incorrect because mother dogs nursing their pups is an instinctual behavior known as maternal behavior, as mother dogs naturally nurse and care for their puppies."

Option (A) is incorrect because newborn turtles crawling towards the sea is an instinctive behavior.

They do not need to learn this behavior; it is natural to them.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because baby birds chewing worms is also an instinctive behavior. They are born with the instinct to eat worms for nourishment.\n\nOption (E) is incorrect because mother dogs nursing their pups is also an instinctive behavior. It is a natural behavior that all mammal mothers engage in to provide milk and care for their offspring.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) seals clapping to the delight of an audience. Seals do not naturally clap in the wild, but through training and conditioning, they can learn to clap in response to cues or rewards. This behavior is not innate and is acquired through training."
