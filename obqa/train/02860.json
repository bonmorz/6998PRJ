Many plants use methods to attract animals such as birds, insects, or mammals to aid in the dispersal of their seeds.

Apple trees reproduce through a process called seed dispersal, where they release their seeds in a way that allows them to be carried away from the parent tree. One common way for apple trees to spread their seeds is by attracting birds.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because apple trees themselves do not physically plant new trees. Option (B) is incorrect because while birds may eat apples, this does not directly facilitate seed dispersal. Option (D) is incorrect because dropping seeds directly beneath the parent tree does not promote the spread of seeds. However, option (C) is correct because apple trees can attract birds by producing fruit that birds find appealing. When birds eat the fruit, they may inadvertently consume and carry away the seeds, aiding in their dispersal to other locations where new apple trees can potentially grow."
