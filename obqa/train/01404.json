Chlorophyll is a pigment found in plant cells that allows plants to absorb energy from sunlight through a process called photosynthesis. Option (A) is incorrect because chlorophyll is not dry, but rather a liquid pigment. Option (B) is incorrect because chlorophyll is found in living plant cells. Option (C) is incorrect because chlorophyll is not clear, but rather green in color. Option (D) is the correct answer because chlorophyll is essential for the health of plants as it allows them to capture and convert energy from the sun."
