A microscope uses a combination of lenses to refract (or bend) light, which effectively magnifies the image of an object. By magnifying the image, the microscope enhances our perception of the object and allows us to see details that are not visible to the naked eye. Option (A) is incorrect because a microscope does not have any effect on the mass of an object. Option (B) is unrelated and not applicable to the topic. Option (C) is incorrect because the volume of an object does not change when viewed under a microscope."
