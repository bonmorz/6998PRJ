Option (B) is the correct answer because throwing plastic in the Pacific would contribute to pollution in the ocean. Plastic pollution is a major issue that affects marine life and the health of our oceans. Option (A) is incorrect because using solar panels on the house actually helps reduce pollution by using clean and renewable energy. Option (C) is incorrect because using plastic to make raincoats does not directly contribute to pollution, although the production and disposal of the raincoats could have environmental impacts. Option (D) is unrelated to pollution as it refers to repurposing glass bottles, which would actually be a more environmentally friendly practice."
