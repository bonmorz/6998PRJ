Some animals, such as humans and other mammals, use perspiration (sweating) as a way to cool down their bodies. When we sweat, the moisture on our skin evaporates, taking away heat in the process. Option (B) is incorrect because eating does not directly help animals adapt to hot temperatures. Option (C) is incorrect because animals do not use fire to adapt to hot temperatures, as fire can actually be harmful to them. Option (D) is incorrect because animals do not use blankets to adapt to hot temperatures, as blankets would only make them hotter."
