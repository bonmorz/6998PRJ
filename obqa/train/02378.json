Option (A), the witch at the top of the hill placing a spell, is likely a fictional scenario and not a realistic cause for gloomy weather. Option (C), a funeral starting at a nearby church, may not directly cause the weather to appear gloomy. Option (D), the earth moving through a dark area of space, is also not a realistic cause for gloomy weather.\n\nOption (B), a warm front moving overhead, is the most likely cause for the gloomy weather. A warm front is a boundary between warm and cold air masses, and when a warm front approaches, it often brings clouds and precipitation. This can cause the sky to appear gloomy and overcast even in the middle of the day."
