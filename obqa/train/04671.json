Amoebas, like all living organisms, have certain duties or responsibilities that must be performed for their survival, such as obtaining food, reproducing, and maintaining homeostasis. Therefore, the correct answer is option (C) - amoebas have all responsibilities. Options (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect because they imply that amoebas have either no duties, the most duties, or only some duties, which is not accurate."
