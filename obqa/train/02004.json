While all the options listed can have some impact on erosion in specific cases, drafts (or moving air currents) are generally the main cause of erosion.

Rain is also a major cause of erosion because the force of the water can wash away soil and sediment. Sunlight and concrete do not directly cause erosion. Sunlight can contribute to weathering, which weakens rocks and makes them more susceptible to erosion, but it is not a direct cause. Concrete, on the other hand, is a man-made material and cannot cause erosion on its own."
