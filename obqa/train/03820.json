The reason birds feeding on seeds from flowering trees in some tropical waters get weighed down, pricked, and entangled in the branches is because the seeds have a thick, sticky coating with hooks. This is a mechanism developed by some plants to increase the chances of seed dispersal by attaching to the feathers or fur of animals. Option (A) is incorrect because it talks about seeds sprouting on the ground, which is not related to the trapping of birds. Option (B) is incorrect because it talks about smooth seeds needing water to reach other islands, which is unrelated to the situation described.

It suggests that smooth seeds need water to reach other islands, which is unrelated to the birds getting trapped in the branches.\n\nOption (D) is irrelevant to the question.

Option (A) is incorrect because it does not explain why the birds would get weighed down, pricked, or entangled in the branches. Option (B) is unrelated to the situation described in the question.

Option (D) is incorrect because it introduces a new concept of scavengers hunting for seeds, which is not mentioned in the question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C): the seeds have a thick, sticky coating with hooks. This answer is supported by the fact that some plants have evolved seeds with sticky coatings that help in dispersal and adhesion to surfaces. The hooks on the coating can easily catch onto the feathers of birds, leading to entanglement and difficulty in movement. This ensures that the seeds are carried away from the tree and potentially germinate in new locations, aiding in the plant's reproductive success and expansion."
