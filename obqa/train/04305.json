Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other organisms convert sunlight into energy. Flora, or plant life, relies on photosynthesis to grow. Option (A) is incorrect because hills are not living organisms and do not require photosynthesis for growth. Option (B) is incorrect because planets are celestial bodies and do not exhibit growth in the same way as living organisms. Option (D) is incorrect because although humans need plants for oxygen and food, they do not directly require photosynthesis for their own growth."
