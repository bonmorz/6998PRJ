When light hits a reflective object, it is redirected or reflected off the object's surface. This is the basic principle behind how mirrors work. Option (A) is incorrect because if light never reaches the object, it wouldn't be able to reflect off it. Option (B) is incorrect because light illuminates the front side of the object, not the backside. Option (C) is incorrect because light does not usually go above the object unless there is a specific angle or surface that causes it to do so."
