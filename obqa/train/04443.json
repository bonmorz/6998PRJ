Option (A) is correct because \"clap on!\" refers to a sound-activated light switch. By clapping, you are completing the circuit and allowing electrical energy to flow to the lightbulb in your room, thus making it brighten. Option (B) is incorrect because jumping in place does not complete an electrical circuit. Option (C) is incorrect because turning a doorknob also does not complete an electrical circuit. Option (D) is incorrect because rubbing your nose does not have any effect on electrical circuits."
