However, when water vapor condenses and forms a cloud, it becomes visible as a white puff in the sky. Option (A) is incorrect because it refers to a natural formation that resembles a bear and not water vapor. Option (B) is incorrect because smoke from a distant fire is not water vapor but rather particles and gases released from burning. Option (C) is incorrect because a group of birds that looks like a wine glass does not represent water vapor."
