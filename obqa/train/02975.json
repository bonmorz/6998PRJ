Carbonic acid, which is formed when carbon dioxide dissolves in water, is a key component in the erosion process. It reacts with minerals in the rock, causing them to break down and create underground chambers. Option (A) is incorrect because carbonated soda does not typically play a role in the natural formation of cavernous chambers. Option (B) is partially correct because carbon dioxide is involved in the formation of carbonic acid, but it is not directly responsible for the formation of the chambers. Option (D) is incorrect because carbon monoxide is not typically involved in the formation of cavernous chambers."
