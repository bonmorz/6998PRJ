The cable carries electricity to the light bulb, which then converts the electrical energy into light energy. Option (B) is incorrect because an oven does not typically provide energy to a light bulb. Option (C) is incorrect because gasoline is not directly connected to the electrical energy needed for a light bulb. Option (D) is incorrect because while a person can turn on a light bulb by flipping a switch, the person themselves is not the source of the energy."
