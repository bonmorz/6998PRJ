Option (A) is the correct answer because decomposition typically occurs in lifeless life forms, such as dead plants and animals. Option (B) is incorrect because decomposition does not involve living creatures breaking down, but rather the breakdown of their remains after death. Option (C) is incorrect because metals do not undergo decomposition. Option (D) is also incorrect because plastics take a very long time to decompose, but they do not break down into simpler substances like organic matter does."
