This means that less gasoline will be needed to travel a certain distance. Option (A) is incorrect because it states that gasoline will take you a lower distance, which contradicts the idea of improved fuel efficiency. Option (B) is unrelated to the question, as it is about gasoline sales rather than the effects of fuel efficiency. Option (C) is also unrelated, as it discusses travel expenses, which can be affected by various factors other than fuel efficiency."
