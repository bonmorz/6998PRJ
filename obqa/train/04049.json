Good bacteria play a crucial role in maintaining a healthy digestive system.\n\nOption (A) states that hot showers are likely the least helpful for the good bacteria. Hot showers do not directly impact the good bacteria in our body because they reside mainly in our digestive system, not on our skin. The temperature of the water we use for showers does not have a significant effect on the bacteria in our gut.\n\nOption (B) states that eating well. This option is likely to be helpful for the good bacteria as they thrive on a healthy and balanced diet rich in fiber. Fiber is a prebiotic, which means it serves as food for the good bacteria in our gut, helping them to flourish and maintain a healthy population.\n\nOption (C) states that keeping hydrated. This option is also likely to be helpful for the good bacteria. Drinking enough water helps support proper digestion and can prevent constipation, which can negatively impact the balance of bacteria in our gut.\n\nOption (D) states using probiotics. Probiotics are live bacteria or yeasts that are beneficial for our overall gut health. Consuming probiotics through supplements or fermented foods can help support the growth of good bacteria in our digestive system.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the least helpful option for the good bacteria that help our body would be (A) hot showers."
