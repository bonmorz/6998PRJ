Obstacles that might impede a dune are typically physical objects, such as cacti or vegetation, that prevent the wind from carrying and depositing sand, thereby hindering the dune's formation or movement. Option (A) is incorrect because Dunes are not impeded by God as it is not a physical object. Option (B) is incorrect because emotions are not physical objects that can hinder the formation or movement of a dune. Option (D) is incorrect because cancers are unrelated to dunes and their movements; they are a type of disease."
