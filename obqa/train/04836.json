If a company produces long-lasting products, it is likely that customers will not need to replace or repurchase those products as frequently. Therefore, the company will likely sell less because customers won't need to buy new products as often. Option (B) is incorrect because producing more products does not necessarily lead to increased sales if the products last a long time. Option (C) is also incorrect because the company may still produce a sufficient quantity of products to meet customer demand, but the overall sales may be lower.
