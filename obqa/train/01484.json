Animals that shed fur in warm weather are typically those with a thick coat or fur to keep them warm in colder temperatures. The answer, a Great Dane, is a breed of dog with a thick coat that may shed fur in warm weather to regulate body temperature. Option (B), a lizard, is incorrect because lizards do not have fur and instead have scales, which they do not shed. Option (C), a bird, is also incorrect because birds do not have fur but instead have feathers, which they do not shed in response to warm weather. Option (D), a fish, is incorrect because fish do not have fur or the ability to shed it."
