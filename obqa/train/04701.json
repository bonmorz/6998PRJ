We need to understand the concept of weight and how it relates to strength. As a person grows older, they typically gain weight and become heavier. Therefore, as the little kid grows older and heavier, it will require more strength to push them on the swing. Option (A) is incorrect because losing weight would make the kid lighter and therefore require less strength. Option (B) is unrelated to the concept of weight and strength.
