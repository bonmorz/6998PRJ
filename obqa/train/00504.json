If a deer is unable to eat regularly or only consumes food that lacks essential minerals, it will experience failing health. Nutritional deficiencies can lead to weakened immune systems, poor growth, and overall poor health. Option (A) is incorrect because if the deer is unable to find healthy food, it will continue to suffer from failing health. Option (C) is incorrect because gestation refers to the process of an animal carrying and giving birth to offspring, which is unrelated to the deer's nutrition. Option (D) is also incorrect because mating is unrelated to the deer's nutritional status."
