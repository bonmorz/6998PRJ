Historically, lighthouses were often powered by oil or gas, but modern lighthouses have shifted to more sustainable and efficient sources of power, including water. \n\nOption (A), the tundra, is incorrect because the tundra is a biome characterized by frozen ground and low temperatures, making it unsuitable for using water as a power source for a lighthouse. \n\nOption (C), the desert, is also incorrect because deserts are typically dry and arid regions with minimal water resources. \n\nOption (D), the mountains, is also incorrect because while mountains may have water sources such as rivers or streams, the elevation and terrain of mountains may not be ideal for using water as a power source for a lighthouse. \n\nThe correct answer is option (B), the ocean. The ocean is a vast body of water with constant movement caused by tides, waves, and currents. This movement can be harnessed to generate hydroelectric power, which can be used to power a lighthouse. Additionally, the proximity of lighthouses to the coast makes them easily accessible to harness the power of the ocean."

In this case, the ocean would be the best place to use water to power a lighthouse. The ocean provides a vast and continuous source of water that can be harnessed for different types of hydroelectric power generation. Lighthouses located near the coast or on offshore structures can use wave energy or tidal energy to produce electricity, which can then power the lighthouse. The other options, such as the tundra, desert, and mountains, do not have as readily available or accessible water sources that can be utilized for this purpose."
