Dew forms when the air cools down and condenses onto surfaces, including grass. Therefore, the glistening grass suggests that the night was chilly. Option (B) is incorrect because the glistening grass is not related to heat. Option (C) is unrelated as snow being yellow has no direct correlation to the information given.
