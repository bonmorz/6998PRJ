Southern Africa is in the southern hemisphere, so its seasons are opposite to those in the northern hemisphere. Therefore, the winter months in southern Africa are June, July, and August. Since the question is asking about snow, which is associated with winter, the most likely month to see snow in southern Africa would be July (option D). Options A, B, and C are all months that fall within the summer or transition seasons in southern Africa, when snow would be unlikely."
