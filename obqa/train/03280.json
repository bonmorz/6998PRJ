A riverbank is the land alongside a river, and it is made up of the materials that the river has eroded and deposited over time. \n\nOption (A), oceans, is incorrect because a riverbank is not made of oceans. Oceans are large bodies of water, not the material that makes up a riverbank. \n\nOption (B), loam, is the correct answer. Loam is a type of soil that is commonly found along riverbanks. It is a fertile soil that contains a mixture of sand, silt, and clay, making it ideal for plant growth. This soil type is often deposited by rivers as they erode the surrounding land and carry sediment downstream. \n\nOption (C), rivers, is incorrect because a riverbank is not made of rivers themselves. A riverbank is the land next to the river, not the river itself. \n\nOption (D), dirty clothing, is incorrect and unrelated to a riverbank. It is not typically made of dirty clothing, but rather natural materials such as soil, sand, rocks, and vegetation."
