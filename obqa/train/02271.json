Option (D) is the correct answer because \"Fe\" is the chemical symbol for iron. Ferrous metals can be used to make items like armor, as they are strong and have good tensile strength. Option (A) is incorrect because steel clogs are not typically made from ferrous metals. Option (B) is incorrect because gold is not a ferrous metal. Option (C) is incorrect because bronze is an alloy, not a pure ferrous metal."
