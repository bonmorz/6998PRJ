Gills are respiratory organs that allow aquatic animals, such as fish like flounders, to intake oxygen from water. Option (B) is incorrect because giraffes are terrestrial animals and do not have gills. Option (C) is partially correct because seals and herons do respire through different mechanisms, but not specifically through gills. Option (D) is incorrect because while some sea-going birds may have specialized respiratory systems, it does not involve gills."
