Lake Ontario, like other Great Lakes, was formed by a combination of tectonic shifts and glacial activities. However, of the given options, mechanical weathering is the most accurate option. Mechanical weathering refers to the physical breakdown of rocks and soil, which would have contributed to the formation of the lake basin. Option (A) is incorrect because construction workers do not have a role in the geological formation of lakes. Option (C) is partially true but does not encompass the entire process of lake formation. Option (D) is incorrect because asteroid impacts are not known to have contributed to the formation of Lake Ontario."
