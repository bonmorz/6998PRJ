When the Earth is tilted on its axis, certain regions are tilted towards or away from the sun, resulting in different seasons. Option (C) is correct because when one continent is experiencing summer, it would be a different season on another continent, and Halloween would be celebrated in that region. Option (A) and (B) are unrelated to the effects of Earth's tilt and are not true. Option (D) is incorrect because the tilt of the Earth's axis does not directly determine the presence of deserts; deserts are influenced by a variety of factors."
