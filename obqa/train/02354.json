Activities such as tasting food, hearing sound, and breathing oxygen are all influenced by genetic factors and can be inherited. However, the ability to cook pasta is a learned skill that is not determined by genetics and therefore is least likely to be inherited. Option (A) is incorrect because taste preferences can be influenced by genetics. Option (B) is incorrect because hearing ability can be influenced by genetic factors. Option (C) is incorrect because the ability to breathe oxygen is necessary for survival and can be influenced by genetic factors."

Option (D) is the correct answer because cooking pasta is a learned skill that is not determined by our genetic makeup. It is something that is taught and acquired through practice and experience. Options (A), (B), and (C) involve sensory and physiological processes that are influenced by our genes. Taste perception (option A), hearing ability (option B), and the ability to breathe oxygen (option C) are all functions of our sensory organs and respiratory system, which are influenced by our genetic makeup."

Activities related to senses like tasting food (A) and hearing sound (B) are likely to have a genetic basis and can be inherited, as they are dependent on the structure and function of our sensory organs. Breathing oxygen (C) is a basic biological process that is necessary for survival and is also likely to have a genetic component, as it is controlled by the respiratory system. Cooking pasta (D), on the other hand, is a learned skill and not a biological activity that is genetically determined. While individuals may learn cooking skills from their family members or be influenced by cultural practices, it is not a behavior that is passed down through genes. Therefore, option (D) is the least likely to be inherited."
