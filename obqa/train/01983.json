Perspiration leaving the torso through evaporation helps to cool the body down. As sweat evaporates from the skin's surface, it takes away heat and cools the body. Option (A) is incorrect because perspiration does not quench thirst, which is related to the need for water intake. Option (B) is incorrect because evaporation actually cools the body rather than heating it up. Option (D) is incorrect because perspiration does not wash anything off the body; it is primarily a mechanism for regulating body temperature."
