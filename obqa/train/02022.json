Hummingbirds are known to be pollinators, meaning they transfer pollen from one flower to another, which helps with fertilization and the growth of new plants. Option (D) is correct because tulips are a type of flower and would benefit from pollination by hummingbirds. Option (A) and (B) are unrelated to the role of hummingbirds in plant growth. Option (C) is not accurate as ants do not rely on hummingbirds for growth."
