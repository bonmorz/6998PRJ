The Mohs scale is a scale that measures the hardness of minerals based on their ability to scratch another mineral. If one mineral can scratch another mineral, it means that the other mineral is softer.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because diamond is the hardest mineral on the Mohs scale and can scratch steel, but steel cannot scratch diamond. Option (B) is incorrect because glass has a hardness of around 5.5 on the Mohs scale, while most rocks have a hardness of 6 or greater. Option (D) is also incorrect because salt has a hardness of around 2 on the Mohs scale, while ruby has a hardness of 9.\n\nOption (C) is the correct answer because diamond is the hardest mineral and can scratch agate, but agate cannot scratch diamond."

Diamond is the hardest mineral on the Mohs Scale, so it can scratch steel. Therefore, steel is softer than diamond. However, this option is not the correct answer because it does not include the mineral that is softer than diamond.\n\nOption (B) includes a rock and glass. Glass is typically harder than most rocks, so a rock would be scratched by glass. However, this option is not the correct answer because it does not include the mineral that is softer than glass.\n\nOption (C) includes diamond and agate. Diamond, being the hardest mineral, can scratch agate. This option is the correct answer because it includes the mineral (agate) that is softer than diamond.\n\nOption (D) includes ruby and salt. Ruby is higher on the Mohs Scale than salt, so ruby would not be able to scratch salt. Therefore, salt is not softer than ruby."
