Filling it with food (option D) would not be practical or make sense in this context.

Option (A) is incorrect because filling a beach ball with water would make it heavy and difficult to play with. Option (B) is also incorrect because filling it with paper would not allow it to be inflated and would not make it bouncy. Option (D) is incorrect because filling it with food would not serve the purpose of playing with the beach ball and would likely ruin the food. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) gas, typically air. Filling a beach ball with gas, such as by blowing air into it, allows it to be inflated and makes it lightweight and bouncy, which is ideal for playing with at the beach."
