To attract pollinators such as bees, plants often produce sweet substances like nectar. The sweet nectar acts as an enticing substance that attracts pollinators to the flowers. Option (B) is incorrect because plants do not use songs to attract pollinators. Option (C) is also incorrect because plants do not use comedy to attract pollinators. Option (D) is partially correct, as bees are indeed often attracted to plants, but it does not explain the enticing substance that plants use to attract bees."
