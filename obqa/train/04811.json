A pupa refers to the stage in the life cycle of insects where they undergo metamorphosis and transform from a larva into an adult. Ants, bees, and butterflies all go through a pupa stage in their life cycles. However, giraffes are mammals and do not undergo metamorphosis, so their offspring will never go through a pupa stage.
