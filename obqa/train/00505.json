While a meter stick and a ruler both measure length, a meter stick is longer than a ruler and is more comparable to a yardstick. \n\nA tape measurer is a flexible tool used to measure longer distances. It typically has measurements in feet and inches. Again, while a meter stick and a tape measurer both measure length, a meter stick represents a shorter unit of measurement. \n\nA yardstick, on the other hand, is a long, straight stick typically one yard (or three feet) in length. It is commonly used to measure larger objects and distances. Since a meter is slightly longer than a yard, a meter stick is most comparable to a yardstick in terms of length.
