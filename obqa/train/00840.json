Option (C) is the correct answer, as tillage refers to the practice of plowing or cultivating soil, which can lead to soil erosion, loss of organic matter, and depletion of nutrients, ultimately harming the environment. Option (A) is not related to negative environmental effects, as pulleys are a simple machine used for lifting objects. Option (B) is also unrelated, as sharks are part of the natural ecosystem and do not directly cause negative effects on the environment. Option (D) is incorrect, as ice is a frozen form of water and does not have a direct negative effect on the environment."
