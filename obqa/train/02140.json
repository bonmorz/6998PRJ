Hummingbirds drink nectar from flowers and as they do so, they also collect pollen on their bodies. When they leave the flower, they carry this pollen with them and transfer it to other flowers, aiding in the process of pollination. Option (A) is incorrect because hummingbirds do not turn bright purple when they leave flowers. Option (B) is incorrect because hummingbirds do not fall to the ground when they leave flowers.

When hummingbirds drink nectar from flowers, they often come into contact with the flower's reproductive structures, such as the stamen and pistil.

When hummingbirds drink nectar from flowers, they often come into contact with the flower's reproductive parts, such as the stamens and pistils. These parts produce a fine powder-like substance called pollen. As hummingbirds move from flower to flower, they inadvertently transfer pollen from one flower to another, aiding in the process of fertilization and plant reproduction. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer as hummingbirds bring special dust (pollen) with them when they leave the flower. Option (A) is incorrect because hummingbirds do not turn bright purple. Option (B) is also incorrect because hummingbirds do not fall to the ground after leaving a flower. Option (D) is incorrect because hummingbirds primarily feed on nectar and insects, not other birds."
