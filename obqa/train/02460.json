In this case, Venus and the Sun are celestial bodies and not objects that can be physically moved, so they are not relevant to the question. A dog and a 100lb weight are both physical objects, but we do not have information about their masses. However, the mass of the Sun is much greater than that of a dog or a 100lb weight. Therefore, the Sun would require more effort to move than any other option."
