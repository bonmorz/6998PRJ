Taiga, also known as boreal forest, is a land type characterized by long, cold winters and short, cool summers. It is found in high latitudes and is covered in snow for the largest portion of the year. Option (B) is incorrect because prairies have a different climate and do not experience as much snow cover.

Due to its climate, the taiga is covered in snow for the largest portion of the year, making it the correct choice.\n\n(B) Prairie: Prairies are grassland ecosystems typically found in temperate regions. They experience distinct seasons, including hot summers and cold winters, but they do not have as long of a snow-covered period as the taiga.\n\n(C) Deciduous forest: Deciduous forests are characterized by trees that shed their leaves seasonally.
