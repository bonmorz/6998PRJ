When a force is applied to one end of the rope, the pulley system allows for the transfer of that force to the load being lifted. In the case of a flagpole, the pulley is used by yanking (applying a force) on the string that is attached to the flag, which causes the pulley to rotate and lift the flag up the flagpole. Option (A) is incorrect because a pulley does not necessarily put something in the air, but rather helps to lift something. Option (C) is incorrect because a pulley typically moves the rope up and down, not sideways. Option (D) is incorrect because a pulley does not necessarily involve things with wheels, but rather the wheel of the pulley itself."
