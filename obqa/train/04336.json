                "content": "This question pertains to the relationship between the position of a light source and the resulting shadow of an object. As a source of light moves directly overhead of an object, the size of the shadow will plummet. \n\nThe reason for this is that when the light source is directly overhead, the object's shadow will be at its smallest. This is because the light rays are coming from directly above and are casting the object's shadow directly beneath it. As the light source moves away from being directly overhead, the angle between the light rays and the object increases, resulting in a larger shadow.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the size of the shadow will not increase as the light source moves directly overhead. Option (C) is redundant and provides similar information to option (A). Option (D) is also incorrect because \"grow\" and \"increase\" are essentially synonymous in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is option (B), which accurately describes the decrease in size of the shadow."
