Option (C) is the correct answer because wild wolves typically try to avoid human contact and will usually run away when they encounter a person. Option (A) is incorrect because while some wolves may be curious about people, it is not accurate to say that they love people. Option (B) is incorrect because wolves do not carry people, and this option seems to be a play on words. Option (D) is not a behavior associated with wolves and is not related to the situation described."
