The mention of a modern facility for seeing in a tunnel suggests that Thomas Edison's work is in use. Thomas Edison is famous for his invention of the electric light bulb, which revolutionized indoor lighting. Therefore, it can be inferred that the tunnel has artificial lighting, likely in the form of electric lights, which is a result of Edison's work. Option (A) is incorrect because the mention of a modern facility for seeing does not necessarily indicate the use of water. Option (C) is incorrect because there is no mention of sunlight being used.
