The hardness scale, known as the Mohs scale, ranks minerals from 1 to 10 based on their scratch resistance. Fingernails have a hardness of approximately 2.5, so they can scratch minerals with a hardness less than 2.5. Copper has a hardness of 3 on the Mohs scale, so it is harder than a fingernail. Calcite has a hardness of 3, so it is also harder than a fingernail. Quartz has a hardness of 7, which is much harder than a fingernail.
