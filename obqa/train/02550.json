This process typically involves using energy and advanced technology. \n\nOption (A) is the correct answer because desalination can have an impact on the habitat of nearby fish. The process usually requires taking in large amounts of seawater and discharging the brine (highly concentrated saltwater) back into the ocean. These discharge events can alter the salinity levels of the surrounding water, which can affect marine organisms, including fish, that are sensitive to changes in their habitat conditions. \n\nOptions (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect answers because they do not accurately describe the impact of desalination on fish. Making the habitat nicer or helping fish out would imply positive effects, but desalination can potentially disrupt the natural balance of the habitat. Giving fish money is irrelevant as they do not have monetary needs or use."
