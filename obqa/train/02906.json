Out of the options given, car windshields are most likely to cause refraction because they are made of glass, which is a medium that can cause the bending of light. Option (A) is incorrect because lego bricks are not transparent and do not allow light to pass through. Option (C) is incorrect because paper is opaque and does not allow light to pass through.
