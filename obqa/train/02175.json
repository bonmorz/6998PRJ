Trees can share nutrients through a process called mycorrhizal symbiosis, in which they form mutually beneficial relationships with fungi. These fungi act as intermediaries, transferring nutrients and water between trees through their underground networks. Option (A) is correct because small creatures, such as the fungi involved in mycorrhizal symbiosis, play a crucial role in facilitating nutrient transfer between trees. Option (B) is incorrect because stamina does not directly relate to the transfer of nutrients between trees. Option (C) and (D) are also incorrect because attitude and strength are not relevant factors in this context."
