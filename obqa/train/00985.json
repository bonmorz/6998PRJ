Organisms with only one cell, known as unicellular organisms, are limited in their ability to specialize because they have only one cell to perform all necessary functions.

Option (B) is incorrect because unicellular organisms cannot freely specialize. Option (C) is incorrect because it assumes uncertainty about specialization, which is not the case.
