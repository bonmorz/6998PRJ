This is because when aluminum cans are redeemed, they are recycled, reducing the need for new aluminum production and saving energy and resources. Recycling aluminum also reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills.\n\nOption (B), burning trash, is harmful to the environment. Burning trash releases harmful pollutants and toxins into the air, contributing to air pollution and potentially harming human health.\n\nOption (C), hunting deer, does not necessarily benefit the environment. While hunting can help control deer populations and prevent overgrazing in certain areas, it can also disrupt ecosystems and lead to imbalances in wildlife populations if not properly managed.\n\nOption (D), building an inground pool, does not directly benefit the environment. While pools can provide recreational opportunities and may have social benefits, building a pool requires resources such as water and energy for maintenance, and it can also lead to increased water usage.\n\nTherefore, based on the potential environmental impact, option (A), redeeming aluminum cans, is the action that may benefit the environment the most."
