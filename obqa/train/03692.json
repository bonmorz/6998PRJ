Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the male reproductive part of a flower to the female reproductive part, which leads to fertilization and the production of seeds. In the case of sunflowers, pollination is required for them to reproduce. Option (A) is incorrect because whales reproduce through sexual reproduction in water, not through pollination.

While whales and humans are animals and reproduce differently, bees play a crucial role in pollination as they transfer pollen between flowers while gathering nectar. Sunflowers, being plants, also rely on pollination for reproduction. Therefore, the correct answer is option (C)."
