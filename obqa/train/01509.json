Option (A) is incorrect because freezing refers to the process of water turning into ice, which is not applicable in this scenario.

Option (D) is incorrect because precipitation refers to the process of water falling from the atmosphere as rain, snow, sleet, or hail, which is not applicable here. The correct answer is (B) evaporation. When the small depression on the paved road is exposed to sunlight, the solar energy causes the water to heat up and evaporate. Evaporation is the process by which liquid water turns into water vapor and enters the atmosphere. This explains why all the water vanishes from the depression."
