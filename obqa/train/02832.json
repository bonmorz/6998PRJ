In many cases, Winter affects the availability of food and can be a challenging time for survival. However, for beavers, Winter can have a positive impact on their ability to reproduce. During Winter, beavers build dams and lodges, which provide protection and shelter. The water around these structures also acts as a thermal buffer, keeping the beavers warm during the cold Winter months. This favorable environment allows beavers to mate and produce offspring. Option (A) is incorrect because Winter has an impact on their life, it is not neutral. Option (B) is incorrect because, although Winter presents challenges, it does not have a negative overall impact on their ability to reproduce. Option (C) is incorrect because Winter does have a noticeable impact on beavers' reproductive cycle, positively influencing their ability to produce offspring."

Beavers typically mate and produce offspring in the Spring, following the Winter season. This is because the Winter provides a time of rest and preparation for beavers, allowing them to store food and make necessary repairs to their lodges. The Winter season positively impacts their life by ensuring that they have enough resources and a suitable environment to support their offspring. Option (A) is incorrect because the impact is not neutral, it is positive. Option (B) is incorrect because the impact is not negative. Option (C) is incorrect because the impact is not very little, it is positive."

Beavers typically mate in late winter and early spring, after coming out of their winter hibernation.

Option (A) is incorrect because it implies no impact on their life, which is not true. Option (B) is incorrect because it implies a negative impact, which is also not true. Option (C) is incorrect because the impact is not negligible, but rather significant in terms of reproductive success."
