When a rabbit has access to reliable plant sources in a field, it is likely to have larger litters. This is because the availability of abundant food increases the rabbit's chances of survival and reproduction, leading to higher reproductive rates. Option (B) may be true in general for rabbits, but it is not specifically related to the presence of reliable plant sources. Option (C) is a possible reaction, as the rabbit may eat more food, but it does not directly address the effect on reproduction.

When a rabbit has access to reliable plant sources in a field, it means that there is an abundance of food available.

This is because having access to sufficient food increases their chances of survival and reproductive success.

Option (C) is also incorrect because while rabbits may eat more food when it is available, it is not necessarily a specific reaction to reliable plant sources.
