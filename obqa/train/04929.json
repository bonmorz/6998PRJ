Decay refers to the gradual deterioration or breakdown of a substance over time. Of the options given, a rhinoceros is most likely to decay. Rocks can erode or break down over time, but this is not considered decay. Radio waves are a form of energy and do not decay in the same way that physical objects do. Steel is a durable material and does not easily decay. However, a rhinoceros, being a living organism, will undergo biological processes that eventually lead to decay after death."

Radio waves are a form of energy that exists in the electromagnetic spectrum and do not undergo decay in the same way matter does.\n\nOption (C), steel, is a strong and durable material that is not prone to decay. While it can rust or corrode over time, this is a slower process and not considered typical decay.\n\nOption (D), a rhinoceros, is a living organism. Organic materials, including living organisms, undergo natural decay processes after death. This includes the breakdown of tissues and the return of nutrients to the ecosystem.\n\nTherefore, option (D), a rhinoceros, is likeliest to decay because it is a living organism subject to natural decomposition processes after death."
