Carrots require loose and well-drained soil that is not too heavy or compacted. Adobe soil, which is a heavy clay soil that retains water, would make it difficult for carrots to grow because it would not provide the right conditions for carrot roots to develop properly. Option (A) is incorrect because topsoil, which is the uppermost layer of soil, is generally ideal for plant growth. Option (B) is incorrect because the question is not asking about a specific location. Option (C) is incorrect because peat, which is partially decayed organic matter, can actually be beneficial for carrot growth as it provides nutrients and helps retain moisture."

Option (B), Kansas, is incorrect because the ability to grow carrots does not depend on the location but rather the soil conditions.
