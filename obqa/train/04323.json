Option (A), mountain bike, is less likely to cause pollution compared to the other options. A mountain bike is powered by human effort and does not emit any pollutants. Option (B), motor bike, typically refers to a motorcycle that is powered by a gasoline engine and can contribute to air pollution through the combustion of fossil fuels. Option (C), dirt bike, is also powered by a gasoline engine and can contribute to air and noise pollution. Option (D), chopper, typically refers to a custom-built motorcycle with a large engine, which can have even higher levels of emissions compared to regular motorcycles. Therefore, out of the given options, the mountain bike is less likely to cause pollution."
