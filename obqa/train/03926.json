By protecting the food from the air, either by covering it or properly storing it, you can prevent bacteria from contaminating the food and causing illness. Option (A) is incorrect because protecting food from bacteria does not have any direct connection to going to space. Option (B) is unrelated to the topic and is exaggeration rather than a logical consequence. Option (C) is unrelated as well since protecting food from bacteria does not have any direct relation to flying."
