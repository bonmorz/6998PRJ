The correct answer is (D) that which contains 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen molecules, which refers to water. Water covers over 90% of the Earth's surface in the form of oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers. However, there is no water on the moon, so it covers 0% of the moon's surface. Option (A) is incorrect because a magnesium iron silicate mineral does not cover the Earth's surface. Option (B) is incorrect because the chemical element with the symbol S refers to sulfur, which is not the correct answer. Option (C) is incorrect because the element with the symbol Fe refers to iron, which does not cover the Earth's surface in the same way water does."
