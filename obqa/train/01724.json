When a brick is liquefied, it undergoes a change in state from a solid to a liquid.

Option (A) is incorrect because electrification refers to the process of charging an object with electricity, which is not relevant to the weight of the brick. Option (C) is incorrect because the weight remains the same even though the brick has changed in state. Option (D) is incorrect because the weight is not removed; it remains the same."
