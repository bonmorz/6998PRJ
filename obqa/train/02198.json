Option (C) is the correct answer because our innate skin color is determined by genetics and cannot be naturally changed. Option (A) is incorrect because language is a learned skill that can be acquired and changed through education and practice. Option (B) is incorrect because money is a man-made concept and not a physical trait of an individual.
