An electrical conductor is needed to power a two-wheel bicycle or run a swing set, as they require an electrical current to function. However, an electrical conductor is not needed to plunge a butter knife through bread or bake a red velvet cake. These actions do not involve the use of electricity. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."
