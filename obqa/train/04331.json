Energy is needed for various biological processes such as growth, reproduction, movement, and maintaining bodily functions. Option (A) is incorrect because while air is important for respiration, it is not a requirement for survival in the same way that energy is. Options (C) and (D) are incorrect because rocks and sand are non-living and do not require energy for survival."
