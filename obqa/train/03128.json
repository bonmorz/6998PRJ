When a shock runs through a wire, it refers to an electrical current flowing through the wire. This current does not physically send sand, water, or smoke through the wire, but rather it sends reactions or electrical signals through the wire. Option (A) is incorrect because sand cannot flow through a wire. Option (B) is incorrect because water cannot flow through a wire. Option (C) is incorrect because smoke cannot travel through a wire."
