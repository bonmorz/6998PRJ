A magnifying glass is a convex lens that is used to enlarge and enhance the visibility of small objects or details. It works by bending and focusing light, allowing us to see objects more clearly.\n\nOption (A) states a tadpole. A magnifying glass would be useful in viewing a tadpole because it would amplify the details and make the tadpole more visible.\n\nOption (B) mentions an ant. A magnifying glass would also be useful in viewing an ant because it would make the ant appear larger and allow us to observe its features more closely.\n\nOption (C) describes a sand grain. A magnifying glass would definitely be helpful in viewing a sand grain as it would make the grain appear larger and allow us to examine its texture and composition.\n\nOption (D) states an elephant. Here is where the answer lies. A magnifying glass would be useless in viewing an elephant because an elephant is already large and visible to the naked eye. A magnifying glass is meant to enhance the visibility of small objects, not enlarge large objects.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) elephant."
