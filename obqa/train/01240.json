Option (B), a paper towel, is also not helpful for conservation because it is made from trees and often used once before being thrown away. Option (C), a shipping box, may or may not be helpful for conservation depending on the context. If the box is being reused or recycled, it can contribute to conservation efforts. However, if it is being used once and discarded, it does not contribute to conservation. \n\nOption (D), a menstrual cup, is the correct answer. Menstrual cups are reusable and can replace disposable menstrual products like pads and tampons. By using a menstrual cup, individuals can significantly reduce their waste generation and environmental impact. Menstrual cups can be reused for several years, making them a sustainable and conservation-friendly option."
