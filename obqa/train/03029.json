Option (A), a seahorse, is incorrect because seahorses are marine creatures found in coastal waters. Option (B), an angler fish, is also incorrect because they are deep-sea creatures that live in the ocean.

A seahorse and an angler fish both live in the oceans, so they would not be seen outside of the ocean. A shark also primarily lives in the ocean, although some species can occasionally swim close to shore. However, a frog is an amphibian and can be found in various environments, including outside of the ocean. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) a frog."
