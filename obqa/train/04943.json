This is because of the tilt of the Earth's axis, which causes the sun to rise and set at different times throughout the year. Option (B) is incorrect because the color of a sunrise can vary depending on atmospheric conditions, but it is not specifically associated with January. Option (C) is incorrect because the age of a sunrise is not a relevant concept. Option (D) is incorrect because sunrises in January are typically later, not earlier."

In January, the sunrise occurs later in the morning compared to other times of the year. This is because during winter months, the Earth's tilt causes the sun to rise at a later time in the morning. Therefore, option (A) - late, is the correct answer. Option (B) - green, is incorrect because the question is asking about the timing of sunrise, not the color. Option (C) - old, is unrelated to the concept of sunrise. Option (D) - early, is incorrect because as mentioned earlier, in January the sunrise is later in the morning compared to other times of the year."
