Option (A) states that a person who eats once daily would be most nourished. This is incorrect because eating only once daily may not provide enough nutrients and energy for the body to function optimally throughout the day.\n\nOption (B) states that a person fasting all day would be most nourished. This is also incorrect because fasting involves abstaining from food for a period of time, which means the body is not receiving the necessary nutrients and energy it needs.\n\nOption (C) states that a person who only drinks water would be most nourished. This is incorrect because although water is essential for hydration, it does not provide all the necessary nutrients the body needs to function properly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (D), a person who feeds thrice daily. Eating three balanced meals throughout the day ensures that the body receives a steady supply of nutrients, energy, and hydration. This allows for proper functioning of bodily processes, maintaining good health, and promoting overall nourishment."

This regular and frequent eating pattern allows for a steady intake of essential nutrients, providing the body with a consistent source of energy and nourishment throughout the day.\n\nOption (A) states that a person eats once daily. While this person may consume a larger meal, they would have longer periods of fasting between each meal, potentially leading to fluctuations in blood sugar levels and inadequate nutrient intake.\n\nOption (B) states that a person is fasting all day. Fasting for extended periods can lead to nutrient deficiencies and insufficient energy levels. While intermittent fasting can have some health benefits, prolonged and consistent fasting may not provide enough nourishment.\n\nOption (C) states that a person only drinks water.
