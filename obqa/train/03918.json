Erosion is the process by which weathering and other natural forces break down and transport rocks and soil. Over time, this can cause mountains to be worn down and leveled. Option (A) is the correct answer because it aligns with this concept. Option (B) is incorrect because erosion affects the land, not the seas. Option (C) is unrelated to the concept of erosion. Option (D) is incorrect because giants are not affected by erosion."
