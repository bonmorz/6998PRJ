Producers, such as plants and some bacteria, are self-sufficient as they are able to produce their own food through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. They do not rely on predators or struggle to survive like other organisms in the food chain. Option (B) and (C) are incorrect because they describe the characteristics of organisms higher up in the food chain. Option (D) is incorrect because decomposers break down organic material, but they are not producers."
