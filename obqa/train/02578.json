A snail moves very slowly and primarily feeds on plants, so it is unlikely to catch its sustenance quickly. A turtle is also relatively slow and mainly eats plants and small aquatic organisms. A sloth is known for its slow movement and primarily eats leaves, so it is not a quick hunter.\n\nOn the other hand, a frigate bird is known as a skilled hunter and can catch fish and other small marine animals while in flight. It has a large wingspan and can soar for long periods, allowing it to spot prey from the air and swoop down to catch it. This makes the frigate bird the most likely animal to catch its sustenance faster.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Frigate Bird."

Therefore, this option is unlikely.\n\nA frigate bird, option (B), is a type of seabird known for its incredible flying and hunting abilities. They are capable of catching food in flight, such as fish, by swooping down and snatching their prey from the water's surface. Therefore, this option is most likely the correct answer.\n\nA turtle, option (C), is primarily aquatic and feeds on aquatic plants and small animals. While they are not known for their speed, turtles can still catch their sustenance at a reasonable pace. However, compared to a frigate bird, their hunting and catching speed may be slower. Therefore, this option is less likely.\n\nA sloth, option (D), is an arboreal mammal known for its slow movement and low metabolic rate. Sloths primarily feed on leaves, which are not difficult to catch but require patience and slow movement. Therefore, this option is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\nOverall, considering the flight and hunting abilities of the frigate bird, it is the most likely animal to catch its sustenance faster compared to the other options."

It moves at a very slow pace, using its slime trail to aid its movement. Due to its slow speed, it would likely take a long time for a snail to catch its sustenance, making option (A) incorrect.\n\nA frigate bird, on the other hand, is a skilled hunter that relies on its agility and speed to catch its sustenance. Frigate birds are known for their ability to catch fish in mid-air. They have long, slender wings that allow them to soar effortlessly across the sky. With their keen eyesight and swift flight, frigate birds are among the fastest hunters in the animal kingdom. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.\n\nA turtle, although slower than a frigate bird, is also capable of catching its sustenance, particularly if it is a carnivorous species that hunts smaller animals in water or on land. However, it is generally slower and less agile than a frigate bird, making option (C) incorrect.\n\nA sloth is a slow-moving arboreal mammal that primarily feeds on leaves. They have a low metabolic rate and spend much of their time hanging upside down from trees. Sloths have adapted to their slow lifestyle and have long claws that allow them to grip branches and move slowly. Due to their slow movement, it would take a considerable amount of time for a sloth to catch its sustenance, making option (D) incorrect.\n\nIn conclusion, the animal that is most likely to catch its sustenance faster is the frigate bird (option B) due to its speed, agility, and hunting abilities."

A snail is a slow-moving animal that relies on plants and decaying matter for sustenance.

Once they identify a potential food source, they dive down and snatch the fish from the water with their sharp beaks. This behavior allows them to catch their sustenance quickly and efficiently.\n\nA turtle, although not as fast as a frigate bird, can also catch its sustenance relatively quickly. Turtles are aquatic animals and are skilled at catching prey such as small fish, insects, and amphibians. They use their strong jaws and claws to grab and consume their food.\n\nA sloth, on the other hand, is a slow-moving animal that primarily feeds on leaves and fruits.
