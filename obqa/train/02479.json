Arctic hares have evolved to have white fur, which provides them with excellent camouflage in snowy, icy environments. Therefore, they would be least likely to be seen by a predator on a hill covered in deep, white, cold snow. Option (A) is incorrect because sitting on the dirt would make the hare more visible. Option (B) is also incorrect because the hare's white fur would stand out against the sand dune. Option (C) is incorrect because the hare's white fur would also stand out on a grass lawn."
