Option (A) states a shady tree, which may provide some relief from the sun but does not protect against other weather elements such as rain or wind. Option (C) suggests a soda can, which is not suitable for providing shelter. Option (D) mentions a playground, but playgrounds are typically open and do not provide sufficient shelter. \n\nOption (B) suggests a local museum, which is the correct answer. Museums are indoor facilities with roofs and walls, giving humans a place to hide from various weather conditions such as rain, wind, and extreme temperatures. They provide protection and shelter, allowing individuals to stay dry and comfortable away from the elements."
