Wires are used to transmit this electrical energy from a power source to the stereo. Coins do not contain electrical energy and cannot be used to power a stereo. Option (C) mentions AAAs, which are batteries commonly used to power electronic devices including stereos. Option (D) is not a viable source of energy and is unrelated to the operation of a stereo. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) AAAs."
