Fog is formed when water vapor in the air condenses into tiny water droplets near the ground. In this scenario, the fog is caused by the condensation of water vapor in the air, so option (B) is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because ash from a volcano can create a different type of atmospheric phenomenon, known as volcanic smog or vog, but not fog. Option (C) is incorrect because helium vapor is not a common cause of fog. Option (D) is incorrect because a forest fire would create smoke, not fog."

Fog is a cloud that forms at ground level when the air is cooled and moisture condenses into tiny water droplets. Option (B) correctly identifies that the fog is formed from the vapor of H2O condensed in the air. Option (A) refers to ash from a volcano, which can indeed cause poor visibility, but in this scenario, the fog is the cause. Option (C) refers to helium vapor, which is not a common component of fog. Option (D) suggests a forest fire, which can also decrease visibility, but the scenario mentioned does not specifically indicate a nearby forest fire. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."
