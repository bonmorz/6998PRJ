When coal and oil are directly removed from the ground, they are processed and made into various products. Coal is commonly used for electricity generation and oil is used for fuel and to produce plastics, chemicals, and other products. Option (A) is incorrect because coal and oil are not directly consumed as they need to be processed first. Option (B) is incorrect because they are not simply thrown away. Option (D) is also incorrect because after extraction, coal and oil are typically transported and used rather than being stored underground."
