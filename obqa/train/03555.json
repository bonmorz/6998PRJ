The wax on plant leaves serves to keep the hydration inside the plant by preventing water loss through evaporation. Option (A) is incorrect because wax does not help plants stay moist in warm weather, but rather prevents them from becoming too dry. Option (B) is incorrect because wax does not serve to keep water available for predators, but rather to conserve water for the plant itself. Option (D) is incorrect because wax does not contribute to the creation of toxins in plant cells, but rather helps protect the plant from external threats such as pests and disease."
