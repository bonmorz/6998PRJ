When the pressure in the air drops very low, it can lead to condensation and the formation of clouds. This process is known as precipitation. Option (A) is incorrect because while clouds can produce rain, they do not flood. Option (B) is incorrect because sinking refers to an object moving downward, and it is not applicable to clouds. Option (D) is incorrect because melting refers to a solid changing into a liquid due to heat, and it is not applicable to clouds."
