Self-absorbed people are typically focused on themselves and their own needs, rather than on others. A lake's reflection is a metaphor for self-reflection and self-obsession. Option (A) is incorrect because empathy involves understanding and considering the emotions and experiences of others, which is not a characteristic associated with self-absorption. Option (C) is incorrect because putting others first goes against the behavior of self-absorbed individuals. Option (D) is also incorrect because thinking of others is not a characteristic associated with self-absorption."
