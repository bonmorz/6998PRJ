Flowers make themselves attractive to hummingbirds by providing nectar as a food source. In order to make it easier for hummingbirds to access the nectar, flowers often have a particular shape or arrangement that provides an optimal angle for the bird's beak to reach the nectar. Option (A) is incorrect because hummingbirds are diurnal (active during the day), not nocturnal. Option (B) is unrelated to attracting hummingbirds. Option (C) is also incorrect because flowers that attract hummingbirds typically have bright and vibrant colors, not dull and subdued colors."

Hummingbirds are attracted to flowers by their bright and vibrant colors, as well as their shape and nectar production. Flowers often have an optimal angle for the hummingbirds to access the nectar, which makes it easier for them to feed. Option (A) is incorrect because hummingbirds are diurnal creatures, meaning they are active during the day. Option (B) is incorrect because prickly thorns would not attract hummingbirds, but rather deter them. Option (C) is also incorrect because dull and subdued colors would not catch the attention of hummingbirds."

Flowers make themselves attractive to hummingbirds by having an optimal angle. Hummingbirds have a unique ability to hover in mid-air and extract nectar from flowers, and they are attracted to flowers that provide easy access to their nectar. An optimal angle refers to the shape and orientation of the flower that allows hummingbirds to easily insert their long bills or tongues into the flower to reach the nectar.

Option (B) is incorrect because prickly thorns would deter hummingbirds from approaching the flowers.
