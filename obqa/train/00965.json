In photosynthesis, the process occurs in specialized structures within plant cells called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain the pigment chlorophyll, which appears green. Therefore, option (A) is correct because it mentions the presence of green pigmentation, which refers to chlorophyll. Option (B) is incorrect because blue pigment is not directly involved in photosynthesis. Option (C) is also incorrect because there is no known pigment called chlorine pigment involved in photosynthesis. Option (D) is unrelated because chloride refers to an anion, or a negatively charged ion, and is not directly involved in photosynthesis."
