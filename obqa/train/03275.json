Camouflage is a defense mechanism used by animals to blend in with their environment and avoid detection by predators. In this case, we are looking for the cause that makes camouflage effective in fooling a predator. \n\nOption (A) states that a predator's eyesight is the most likely cause of camouflage's effectiveness. This is because most predators rely heavily on their visual senses to locate and catch their prey. If an animal is able to blend in with its surroundings through camouflage, it becomes more difficult for a predator to visually detect and target it.\n\nOption (B) suggests that a predator's sense of hearing is the cause. While some predators may use sound to locate prey, it is not the primary sense used for detecting camouflage. \n\nOption (C) mentions a predator's sense of style, which is irrelevant to the effectiveness of camouflage. \n\nOption (D) states that a predator's poor sense of smell is the cause. However, this is also irrelevant to camouflage, as it primarily works through visual deception rather than scent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) a predator's eyesight, as it is the sense most commonly used for detecting prey and can be effectively deceived by camouflage."

Camouflage is a defense mechanism used by prey to blend in with their surroundings and avoid detection by predators. Option (A) states that a predator's eye sight is the most likely cause of camouflage's effectiveness. This is because predators rely on their sight to locate and capture prey. If a prey animal is able to blend in with its environment through camouflage, it becomes harder for the predator to spot it. \n\nOption (B) suggests that a predator's sense of hearing is the cause of camouflage's effectiveness. However, camouflage primarily relies on visual deception rather than auditory deception, so this option is less likely.\n\nOption (C) suggests that a predator's sense of style is the cause of camouflage's effectiveness. However, this is not supported by any scientific evidence or logical reasoning, so this option can be ruled out.\n\nOption (D) suggests that a predator's poor smelling is the cause of camouflage's effectiveness. While an animal's scent may play a role in some predator-prey interactions, camouflage primarily relies on visual deception. Therefore, this option is less likely.\n\nBased on the above analysis, option (A) - a predator's eye sight - is the most likely cause of camouflage's effectiveness."
