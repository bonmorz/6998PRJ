Camels have adapted a raised portion on their dorsal side, known as a hump, which stores fat and helps them survive in their habitat. Option (A) is incorrect because camels do not have long ears the size of an elephant's. Option (C) is incorrect because camels have adapted long snouts to prevent sand and dust from entering their nostrils, not to drink from holes. Option (D) is incorrect because camels have not adapted long ears the size of an elephant's and while they do have long snouts, it is for a different purpose unrelated to drinking from holes."
