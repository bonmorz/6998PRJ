Sedimentary layers are typically formed through the process of weathering and erosion of rocks.

The river may erode and transport sediment from the surrounding areas during periods of heavy rainfall, snowmelt, or flooding. This sediment is then deposited along the riverbed, creating layers of material.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because fish swimming in the river would not contribute to the deposition of sediment on the riverbed.
