Cats, dogs, and rats are mammals and are considered warm-blooded because they are able to regulate their body temperature internally. Tree hoppers, on the other hand, are insects and are classified as cold-blooded because their body temperature depends on the temperature of their surroundings. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer."

Cats, dogs, and rats are all warm-blooded mammals, meaning their body temperature is regulated internally and remains relatively constant."
