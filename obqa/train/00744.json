This is because the Earth is tilted on its axis, causing different parts of the globe to receive different amounts of sunlight throughout the year. When the northern hemisphere, which includes the USA, is tilted towards the sun, it is summer in that region. At the same time, the southern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, causing it to be winter there. Options (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because they do not correspond to the correct hemisphere."
