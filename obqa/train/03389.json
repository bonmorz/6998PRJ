Pollution refers to the introduction of harmful substances or contaminants into the environment, causing negative effects on living organisms. Option (B) is the correct answer because throwing plastic in the ocean is a clear example of pollution. Plastics in the ocean harm marine life and contribute to the degradation of the ecosystem. Options (A), (C), and (D) are not examples of pollution. Recycling old glass to make a house (A) and using old shirts to make a blanket (D) are examples of reusing materials, which is actually a sustainable practice. Donating clothes to a thrift shop (C) is an example of giving used items a second life and reducing waste, which is also a positive action for the environment."
