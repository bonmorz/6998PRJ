In this case, the phenomenon of steam coming from hot cocoa is best described as evaporation because the heat causes the liquid cocoa to turn into vapor. Option (A) is incorrect because caffeine is a compound that can sublimate, not evaporate. Option (B) is incorrect because heat is not a substance that can evaporate. Option (D) is incorrect because flavor is a sensory experience and cannot evaporate."
