When rabbits in a county die off, it means that there is less food available for the foxes. As a result, the fox population will not boom in population as option (B) suggests. Foxes may experience a temporary decrease in population if they cannot find an alternative food source, but they will not do the same as option (C) suggests. Option (D) is incorrect because foxes are carnivores and do not eat trees. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) - do the same, meaning that the fox population will remain unchanged."
