A sunset occurs when the sun appears to move below the horizon, creating a beautiful display of colors in the sky. Disregarding any catastrophic events like nuclear holocausts, there will always be one sun in the sunset. This is because the sunset is caused by the rotation of the Earth, which makes the sun appear to set.
