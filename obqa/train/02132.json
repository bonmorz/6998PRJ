Option (A) states that a cold front had moved into the area. This is the correct answer because when a cold front moves into an area, it lowers the temperature and can cause the water in the pond to freeze or form a layer of ice on the surface, making it hard enough to walk on.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because if the pond had drained into an underground river, there would be no water left on the surface to walk on.\n\nOption (C) is also incorrect because the presence of algae on the pond's surface would not make it hard enough to walk on. Algae would make the surface slippery and potentially unsafe to walk on.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because rainfall the night before would not necessarily make the pond's surface hard enough to walk on.
