As the wind blows, it causes the turbines to spin, which generates electricity. Option (A) is incorrect because wind is not directly used for producing cupcakes. Option (B) is incorrect because wind is not directly used for producing smores. Option (D) is incorrect because wind is not directly used for producing plants. Option (C) is the correct answer because wind can be used to produce excited particles flowing, which refers to the generation of electricity."
