This option is correct because songbirds are attracted to food sources, specifically seeds. Hanging an open box allows the songbirds to easily access the seeds and encourages them to visit your yard. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because songbirds do not eat hamburgers. Their diet consists mainly of seeds, insects, and berries. Option (B) is also incorrect because a yard with large dogs may actually deter songbirds from visiting as they may perceive it as a threat. Option (C) is ineffective because simply calling out to the birds will not provide them with a food source to attract them to your yard."
