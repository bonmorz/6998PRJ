Therefore, option (C) can be eliminated. When hunting, creatures rely on their senses of sight, smell, and hearing to locate and catch their prey. However, depending on the specific hunting strategy, certain senses may be avoided or minimized. For example, creatures that rely on stealth or camouflage may avoid using their sense of sight to keep a low profile and not alert their prey. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that sight would be avoided in all hunting scenarios. Smell and hearing, on the other hand, are commonly used by predators to locate prey, making them less likely to be avoided in a hunting situation. Hence, option (C) is the correct answer."
