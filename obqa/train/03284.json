When a potato is placed in a roaring bonfire, it will experience much higher temperatures than when it is left in a warm oven.

Option (A) is incorrect because chilling requires cold temperatures, which are not present in either scenario. Option (B) is also incorrect because freezing requires temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius, which are not present in either scenario. Option (D) is unrelated to the effects of heat on a potato."
