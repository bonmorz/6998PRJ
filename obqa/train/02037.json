Hydro-electric vehicles do not require gasoline as they run on electricity, thus reducing the demand for gasoline and potentially leading to a decrease in profits for gas stations. Option (A) is incorrect because if gas stations are losing money, they would not be earning a lot of money. Option (B) is an extreme and unlikely scenario that is not related to the impact of hydro-electric vehicles. Option (D) is also incorrect because if gas stations are losing money, they would not be reporting record growth in the third quarter. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer."
