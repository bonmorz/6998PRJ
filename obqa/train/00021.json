This is because many predatory animals, including owls, have evolved to blend in with their surroundings in order to remain hidden from their prey. This enhances their chances of successfully capturing their prey. Option (A) is incorrect because the owl is not actually invisible, it is just difficult for the mouse to detect. Option (B) is incorrect because the mouse being unaware does not mean it is oblivious. Option (C) is incorrect because there is no information given to suggest that the mouse is blind."
