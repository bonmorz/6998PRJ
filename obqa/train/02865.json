At the equator, the length of daylight and nighttime remain relatively constant throughout the year. However, as we move further away from the equator, the length of daylight and nighttime changes. The longest days occur during the summer solstice, which happens around June 21st in the Northern Hemisphere. To determine when the days would be the longest 1000 miles north of the equator, we need to consider that the seasons are reversed in the Southern Hemisphere. So, if the summer solstice occurs around June 21st in the Northern Hemisphere, then 1000 miles north of the equator, the longest days would occur approximately 6 months later, in December (option C). Option A is incorrect because the longest days do not necessarily mean the longest nights. Option B does not take into account the specific geographic location or the tilt of the Earth. Option D is incorrect because the longest days occur during the summer season, not the fall."
