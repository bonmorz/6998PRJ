Echolocation is a process where animals emit sound waves and then listen for the sound waves to bounce back off of objects to determine their location. Some animals, such as dolphins and bats, use this method to navigate and find prey. These animals can be found in various habitats, but the option that best fits the description is (D) rivers. Some species of bats, for example, live near rivers and use echolocation to find insects along the water's edge. The other options (A) the arctic, (B) soil, and (C) a tide pool, do not specifically refer to habitats that are commonly associated with animals that use echolocation."
