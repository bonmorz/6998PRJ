Producers, such as plants, are able to produce their own nourishment through the process of photosynthesis. They convert sunlight into chemical energy, which they can then use for growth and survival. Option (B) is incorrect because producers do not produce plays. Option (C) is incorrect because rhythm is not a form of nourishment. Option (D) is incorrect because a producer refers to an organism that can produce its own energy, not necessarily a heartbeat."
