When there is more water available, the habitat becomes more suitable for aquatic animals, providing them with more resources and space. As a result, their numbers will increase.

Option (B) is incorrect because human intervention does not necessarily have a direct impact on aquatic animal populations in this context. Option (D) is incorrect because stagnant water does not necessarily support the growth and survival of aquatic animals."
