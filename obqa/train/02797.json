The unseen force mentioned in the question is gravity, which tugs at celestial bodies and gives them a trajectory or path of movement. Option (A) is incorrect because gravity does not specifically give celestial bodies shape. Option (B) is also incorrect because luster refers to the brightness or sheen of an object, which is not directly related to gravity. Option (D) is also incorrect because color is not determined by gravity, but rather by different factors such as the composition of the celestial body's surface."
