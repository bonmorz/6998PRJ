Icebergs, being chunks of ice floating in the ocean, do not provide a suitable habitat for amphibians. Option (A) is incorrect because Mexico has several species of amphibians. Option (C) is incorrect because England also has various species of amphibians. Option (D) is incorrect because Texas has multiple species of amphibians, including frogs, toads, and salamanders. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Icebergs, as they do not support amphibian life due to their harsh and icy conditions."

Icebergs are chunks of ice that float in the ocean and do not have the necessary conditions or habitats for amphibians to survive. Amphibians are dependent on water sources for their reproduction and survival, and icebergs do not provide suitable habitats for them."
