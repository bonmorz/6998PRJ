Copper is a highly conductive material, meaning it allows electric current to flow through it easily. Option (A) is incorrect because the ground is not a material that electricity can flow through, but rather a reference to the Earth's surface. Option (B) is incorrect because while water can conduct electricity, it is not specified whether the water is a conductor in this case. Option (C) is incorrect because air is not a good conductor of electricity."
