When deer are repeatedly sprayed with pesticides, it is likely that they will experience negative effects on their health and well-being.

If a load of deer is moved to a small park and repeatedly sprayed with pesticides, it is likely that the deer will suffer negative effects from the pesticides.

As a result, the deer population in the park will eventually decrease and it will become deerless. Options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because the repeated exposure to pesticides is likely to have detrimental effects on the deer, not allowing them to thrive, be healthy, or have happy lives."

Spraying deer with pesticides is harmful to their health and well-being, so it is unlikely that they will thrive in that environment (option A) or be healthy and happy (option B). Option C, stating that the deer are given happy lives, is subjective and does not provide a logical explanation. \n\nGiven that the deer are repeatedly sprayed with pesticides and are placed in a small park, their population is likely to decrease over time. Pesticides can have negative effects on reproductive capabilities and the overall health of animals. Additionally, the limited space in a small park may not provide enough resources to sustain a growing deer population. Therefore, it can be inferred that the park will eventually be deerless (option D) as the deer population diminishes."
