A bear snacking on a tiny bird indicates that it is not a herbivore, as herbivores only eat plants. This eliminates option (A).

An omnivore is an animal that eats both plants and animals, a carnivore is an animal that primarily eats other animals, and a predator refers to an animal that hunts and kills its prey.

However, the fact that the bear is snacking on a tiny bird indicates that it is indeed a carnivore as well. So, both options (B) and (C) are incorrect. Similarly, the term \"predator\" is also applicable to bears, as they are hunters and consume prey. Therefore, option (D) is also incorrect. The only option that is not applicable to the bear in this scenario is (A) herbivore, as herbivores only eat plants."
