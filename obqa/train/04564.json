Rabbits are known to be burrowers and typically live underground in burrows. Living underground provides protection for rabbits from predators and other dangers. Option (A) is incorrect because rabbits do not surf. Option (B) is not always true as rabbits can nest above ground in certain circumstances, but it is not their primary form of protection.
