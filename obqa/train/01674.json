From Earth, we see the moon going through phases where it appears to be partially or completely covered by the Earth's shadow. This is known as a lunar eclipse.

Option (A) is incorrect because the moon itself does not \"see\" the sun during eclipses. Options (C) and (D) are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the relationship between the moon and the Earth during eclipses."
