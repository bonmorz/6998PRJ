Raw materials refer to natural resources or substances that are used to manufacture or produce a final product. These materials are required throughout the entire production process, along with labor and capital, to create the final product. Option (A) is incorrect because raw materials are not necessarily degraded during the process, although they may undergo transformation or refinement. Option (B) is incorrect because raw materials can be either natural or man-made. Option (D) is incorrect because raw materials are used throughout the production process, not just in the final phase."
