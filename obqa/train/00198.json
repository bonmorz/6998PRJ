Adapting to survive means adjusting or changing behaviors or characteristics in order to better survive in a specific environment or situation. Option (A) is the correct answer because putting on sunscreen in a sunny place is an example of adapting to survive in a way that protects the skin from excessive UV radiation and reduces the risk of sunburn and skin damage. Option (B) is incorrect because growing grass in a field is a natural process and not necessarily an example of adaptation. Option (C) is incorrect because having a drink of water on a warm day is a basic need and not specifically an example of adaptation. Option (D) is also incorrect because going for a walk outside is a recreational activity and not necessarily an example of adaptation for survival."
