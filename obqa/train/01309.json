Camouflage is a method used by entities (such as animals or soldiers) to blend in with their environment and remain unseen by predators or prey. Option (A) is incorrect because air is not an entity that hunts or uses camouflage. Option (B) is correct because trees, particularly the patterns and colors of their bark or leaves, can provide camouflage for animals. Option (D) is incorrect because water is not an entity but a substance, and it does not typically require camouflage. Option (C) is incorrect because \"vittles\" refers to food and is not related to camouflage."
