Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.\n\nOption (B) states \"during snowfall.\" Snowfall occurs when the air is cold enough for water vapor to freeze and fall as snow. This indicates that the air is relatively moist, but it does not necessarily mean that the overall humidity is high. Therefore, option (B) is incorrect.\n\nOption (C) states \"before a hurricane.\" Hurricanes are large, powerful tropical storms that generate significant amounts of moisture. As a hurricane approaches, it collects warm, moist air from the surrounding ocean. This leads to high levels of humidity in the atmosphere. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer.\n\nOption (D) states \"on a mountain.\" Humidity tends to decrease as altitude increases. At higher elevations, the air becomes colder and can hold less moisture, leading to lower humidity levels. Therefore, option (D) is incorrect.\n\nOverall, option (C) before a hurricane represents a situation with the greatest amount of humidity due to the collection of warm, moist air associated with such storms."
