When an instrument such as a pencil or pen is sharpened, the leftover material that is pressed to paper is typically graphite or ink. Neither of these options are listed in the answer choices, so we can eliminate options (A) and (B). Option (D) is not accurate because the color of the leftover material will depend on the type of writing instrument being used and may not necessarily be bright white. This leaves us with option (C), which suggests that the leftover material is a mineral. This is a general and accurate description as both graphite and ink are composed of various minerals."

When writing with a sharpened instrument, such as a pencil or a graphite stick, tiny particles of the writing material are scraped off and transferred to the paper.
