Jungles are known for their diverse plant and animal life, including a wide array of birds, mammals, reptiles, insects, and amphibians. Oceans are teeming with diverse marine life, including fish, mammals, crustaceans, mollusks, and various other organisms. Option (B) is incorrect because not all organisms in these ecosystems are fish. Option (C) is not specific enough to include the wide range of organisms found in these ecosystems. Option (D) is incorrect because grasses are not typically found in deserts or oceans."

Deserts may have animals like camels, scorpions, and snakes, as well as various plants and insects that have adapted to survive in arid conditions. Jungles are known for their rich biodiversity, with countless species of plants, animals, birds, and insects. Oceans are teeming with life, from small microscopic organisms like plankton to large marine mammals like whales and dolphins.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because fish are specific to oceans and not found in deserts or jungles. Option (C) is incorrect because trees are more commonly found in jungles and not as prevalent in deserts or oceans. Option (D) is incorrect because grasses are typically found in grasslands and not in deserts, jungles, or oceans."
