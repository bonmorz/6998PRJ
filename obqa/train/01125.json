This is because construction nails are typically made of ferromagnetic materials, such as iron. Ferromagnetic materials are strongly attracted to magnetic fields and can become temporarily magnetized when placed in a magnetic field. So, when the battery becomes active and generates a magnetic field, it will magnetize the construction nail.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect.
