If a deer lives in an area with trunks, it is likely to be a forested area with trees. In such an environment, the color that best matches the trunks is the color of the grass and foliage, which is typically green. Therefore, the area is likely to be a color matching a grasshopper. Option (B) is incorrect because the sky is typically blue and does not match the color of the trunks. Option (C) is incorrect because clownfish typically inhabit coral reefs and would not be relevant to a forested area. Option (D) is incorrect because bananas are typically yellow and do not match the color of the trunks."
