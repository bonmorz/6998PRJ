Water is essential for survival and reproduction, so having more water sources would create a more desirable habitat for organisms, leading to population growth. \n\nOption (A), drying out any water sources, would have the opposite effect and decrease population growth because it would limit access to water. Option (C), planting more toxic flowers, would not directly impact population growth and may even have negative effects if the toxic flowers deter pollinators or harm other organisms. Option (D), killing off any prey, would disrupt the food chain and could decrease population growth by starving predators or forcing them to move to a new area.
