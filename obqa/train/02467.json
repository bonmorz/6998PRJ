Option (A) refers to rivers, which have the ability to exert a force on objects and push them along as they flow downstream.

While rainfall can cause objects to move, it is not primarily known for pushing objects like rivers do. Option (C) refers to photosynthesis, which is a process that converts light energy into chemical energy in plants. While photosynthesis is essential for plant growth and the production of oxygen, it does not involve pushing objects. Option (D) refers to sunlight, which is a form of radiant energy from the sun. Sunlight does not directly push objects as it travels through space and reaches the Earth's surface. Therefore, option (A), rivers, is the most likely choice for something that can push objects."
