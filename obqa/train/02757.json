In this case, the answer is (A) nutriment, or in other words, resources or fuel. When something expands, it generally requires energy or resources to fuel the expansion. Option (B) pipes is incorrect because pipes are typically used to transfer a substance rather than contribute to expansion. Option (C) flounder is unrelated and does not contribute to expansion. Option (D) conversation is unrelated and does not provide the resources needed for expansion."
