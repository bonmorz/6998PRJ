Option (A) is incorrect because deer are herbivores, meaning they primarily eat plants and do not eat other animals. Option (B) is also incorrect because elephants are herbivores and do not eat other animals. Option (C) is incorrect because worms are detritivores, meaning they eat decaying organic matter and do not actively hunt and eat other living animals. Option (D) is the correct answer because lions are carnivores, meaning they hunt and eat other living animals as part of their natural diet."
