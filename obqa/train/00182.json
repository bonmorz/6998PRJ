Option (A) is the correct answer because seeds can travel through bodies of water, such as rivers or oceans, where they can be carried by fish. This mode of seed dispersal is known as hydrochory. Option (B), (C), and (D) are all incorrect because they do not represent natural seed dispersal methods. Option (B), word of mouth, is a metaphorical expression and not a method by which seeds travel. Option (C), knowledge, does not involve physical movement of seeds. Option (D), boat, is not a natural seed dispersal method."

Some plants produce seeds that are encased in fruits or berries and are consumed by fish. The fish then swim to other areas or bodies of water, where they may shed the seeds through their waste or by spitting them out. Option (B) is incorrect because seeds do not travel through word of mouth, which is a phrase used to describe the spreading of information through oral communication. Option (C) is unrelated to seed dispersal. Option (D) is incorrect because while seeds may occasionally travel on boats unintentionally, it is not a natural or intentional method of dispersal."
