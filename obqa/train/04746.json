When something is described as \"snowy,\" it means that there is a large amount of snow present. Snow is composed of ice particles, making option (C) the correct answer.

Option (B) is incorrect because snowy conditions do not necessarily indicate the presence of a large amount of rivers. Option (D) is incorrect because while snowy conditions can be accompanied by wind, the term \"snowy\" does not specifically refer to wind."
