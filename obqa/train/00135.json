First, it's important to note that glaciers move very slowly, typically only a few centimeters per day. This is due to the immense weight and thickness of the ice, which causes it to deform and flow very slowly.\n\nOn the other hand, sea-going vessels can travel at much faster speeds, depending on their design and power. Ships can reach speeds of 20-25 knots (23-29 mph) on average, with some larger vessels capable of even higher speeds.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that a sea-going vessel will generally travel at greater speeds than a glacier.

Option (D) is incorrect because it implies that the glacier has some advantage in terms of speed, which is not true.
