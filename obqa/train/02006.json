The Earth rotates on its axis, causing the sun to appear to move across the sky during our waking hours. Option (A) is incorrect because the sun does not appear to move during the dark hours when it is not visible. Option (B) is a phrase that does not have a direct relationship to the movement of the sun. Option (C) is incorrect because the sun is not visible during the night, so it does not appear to move across the sky."
