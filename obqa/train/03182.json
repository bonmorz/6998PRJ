When a person plants different crops in their garden, like beets and cucumbers, they are practicing crop rotation. Crop rotation helps improve soil health because different plants have different nutrient needs and deplete different nutrients from the soil. So, by switching between different plants, the gardener can ensure that the soil is not depleted of specific nutrients and remains healthier. Option (A) is incorrect because planting different crops does not specifically clean up dirt. Option (C) is incorrect because there is no process of removing dirt molecules involved in crop rotation. Option (D) is incorrect because the goal of crop rotation is not specifically to make dirt green, but rather to maintain soil health."
