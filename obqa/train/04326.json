Bears have a habit of eating a lot of food during a season called hyperphagia, which occurs in preparation for the winter hibernation. During hibernation, bears rely on their stored fat as a source of energy since they do not eat or drink. By eating a lot and accumulating fat, the bear is preparing for the snowy season when food sources may be limited.
