Mirrors reflect light because the material of which they are made, usually glass with a reflective coating, makes it difficult for light to travel through.

Mirrors are made of materials that allow light to easily pass through, such as glass, and have a thin layer of metal, typically aluminum or silver, on the back that reflects the light. This reflection occurs because when light enters the mirror and encounters the metal layer, it is absorbed and then re-emitted in a different direction. The process is not loud, long, or easy, but it can be considered difficult because the light has to change direction when it interacts with the metal layer in the mirror. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer."
