An instinctive behavior is a behavior that is genetically determined and innate, meaning it is present in an organism from birth without the need for learning or prior experience. Options (A), (B), and (D) are all elements of nature and not behaviors, so they can be ruled out. Option (C), revenge, is a behavior that is often seen in animals, such as a mother defending her young or an animal seeking retaliation against a predator. Revenge is an instinctive behavior that serves the purpose of protecting oneself or one's offspring."
