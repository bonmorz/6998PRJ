Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and some microorganisms convert sunlight into energy. Option (D) is correct because plants, such as the yellow tulip, have chlorophyll in their leaves that allows them to perform photosynthesis. Option (A) is incorrect because wasps are animals and do not have the necessary organelles for photosynthesis. Option (B) is also incorrect because cheetahs are animals and do not have the ability to perform photosynthesis. Option (C) is incorrect because dirt does not have the necessary organelles or pigments for photosynthesis."
