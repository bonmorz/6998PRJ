The word \"precipitation\" is used to describe any form of water, liquid or solid, that falls from the atmosphere to the Earth's surface. This includes rain, snow, sleet, and hail. When it is raining or there is a chance of rain, we commonly use an umbrella to stay dry. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.\n\nOption (A), \"altercation,\" is unrelated to the use of an umbrella and refers to a disagreement or argument between people. Option (C), \"condensation,\" is the process by which a gas or vapor turns into a liquid. While condensation is involved in the formation of rain in the atmosphere, it does not directly relate to the need for an umbrella. Option (D), \"evaporation,\" is the process by which a liquid turns into a vapor. While evaporation is part of the water cycle that leads to precipitation, it does not directly explain the need for an umbrella."
