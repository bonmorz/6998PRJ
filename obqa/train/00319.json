This stimulation sends electrical signals to the brain, and as a result, we are able to see the object.

Option (A) is incorrect because blurring refers to a lack of focus, not the result of reflecting light. Option (C) is incorrect because reflecting light does not cause blindness, although intense glare can temporarily impair vision. Option (D) is incorrect because glare refers to an excessive and uncomfortable brightness, but it is not the result of reflecting light."
