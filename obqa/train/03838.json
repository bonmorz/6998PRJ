While they can be found in various habitats such as forests, gardens, and grasslands, they are most commonly found on the ground near bodies of water like ponds, lakes, or streams. Option (A) is the correct answer because it aligns with the natural habitat and behavior of toads. Options (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because toads are not typically found in the air, sea, or volcanoes."
