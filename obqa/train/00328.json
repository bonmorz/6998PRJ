When you move your face further from a mirror, it will appear smaller because the distance between your face and the mirror has increased. Option (A) is incorrect because your face would actually appear smaller, not bigger. Option (B) is not related to the question, as \"appearing in macro\" does not provide any information about how the face would appear. Option (D) is also incorrect because moving your face further from the mirror would make it more difficult to see fine details such as pores. However, moving your face further from the mirror can make wrinkles less obvious because the decreased proximity to the mirror can soften the appearance of lines and wrinkles."
