A plant light serves to mimic sunlight and provide necessary light energy for plants to undergo photosynthesis. Option (A) is incorrect because plants do not have the same capacity for comfort as humans do. Option (C) is incorrect because the purpose of a plant light is to provide light, not warmth. Option (D) is incorrect because protecting plants from bugs is not the primary purpose of a plant light, although it may indirectly help in some cases."
