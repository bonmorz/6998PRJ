A magnet will only attract objects that contain magnetic materials, such as iron or steel.

Option (B) is incorrect because gum is not made of a magnetic material. Option (C) is incorrect because not all of the objects listed are made of magnetic material. Option (D) is incorrect because a piece of chicken does not contain a magnetic material."
