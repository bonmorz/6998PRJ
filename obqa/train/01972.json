Sedimentary rocks are formed from the accumulation and compaction of sediments such as sand, silt, and clay over time. Option (B), old silt, is the correct answer because silt is one of the main components of sedimentary rocks. Option (A), metal, is incorrect because metal is not a component of sedimentary rocks. Option (C), grass, and option (D), hay, are both incorrect because organic materials like grass and hay do not directly form sedimentary rocks."
