Prehistoric bones are commonly found in shale, which is a fine-grained sedimentary rock that forms from the compaction of mud or clay. Shale is known for its ability to preserve fossils due to its fine-grained nature and ability to hold fine details. Option (A) is incorrect because bones are not commonly found in granite, which is an igneous rock formed from the cooling of magma or lava. Option (C) is incorrect because bones are not commonly found in trees, as trees are living organisms and not conducive to fossilization. Option (D) is incorrect because bones are not commonly found in marble, which is a metamorphic rock formed from the recrystallization of limestone."
