Option (C) is incorrect because the flipping of the Earth's electromagnetic field does not have a direct impact on rainstorms. Option (D) is incorrect because rivers and lakes overflowing can happen due to heavy rainfall, but it is not a direct precursor to a rainstorm.\n\nThe correct answer is option (B) - atmospheric water droplets collide. Before a rainstorm, there is often an increase in humidity in the air. This leads to the formation of clouds. Within these clouds, water droplets collide and combine to form larger droplets. Eventually, these droplets become heavy enough to fall to the ground as raindrops, resulting in a rainstorm."
