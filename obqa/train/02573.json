When a plant is watered, the liquid is transported from the soil area to where it is needed using the xylem system. Xylem is a type of plant tissue that functions as a conducting system, responsible for transporting water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant. Option (B) is incorrect because flowering pistols are the reproductive parts of a flower and not involved in water transportation. Option (C) is incorrect because a sprinkler is an external method of watering, not an internal system within the plant.
