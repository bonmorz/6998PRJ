A learned characteristic is something that is acquired or developed through experience or education.\n\nOption (A) Eye color is not a learned characteristic. Eye color is determined by genetics and is generally fixed from birth.\n\nOption (C) Freckles are also not a learned characteristic. Freckles are caused by a combination of genetics and exposure to the sun. They can vary in intensity based on sun exposure, but they are not something that is learned.\n\nOption (D) Hair color is also not a learned characteristic. Hair color is determined by genetics and typically does not change throughout a person's lifetime.\n\nOption (B) A cartwheel, however, is a learned characteristic. Learning to do a cartwheel requires practice, coordination, and muscle memory. It is a physical skill that is acquired through experience and practice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) a cartwheel, as it is the only characteristic listed that can be considered a learned characteristic."
