Early humans learned repeating weather patterns, star formations, and time intervals to make predictions about planting and harvesting times and when certain animals would hibernate. Option (C) is the correct answer because it states that early humans realized that one year consists of 365 days and nights, which allowed them to track the passage of time and make predictions about seasonal changes. Option (A) is incorrect because the sky is not always blue at night. Option (B) is incorrect because while many plants do take a year to grow, this knowledge alone would not be sufficient to make accurate predictions about planting and harvesting times. Option (D) is incorrect because the sun does not remain still for 12 months a year; its position in the sky changes throughout the year."

Option (D) is incorrect because the sun is not still for 12 months a year - it appears to move across the sky due to the Earth's rotation.
