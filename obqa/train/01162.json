Vibration involves the rapid back-and-forth movement of particles, which can have different effects depending on the object in question. Option (B) is the correct answer because a harpsichord is a musical instrument that produces sound through vibrating strings. The vibration of the strings causes the air molecules around them to vibrate, creating sound waves. Options (A), (C), and (D) do not involve vibration in the same way. A paper airplane does not vibrate, but rather glides through the air. A pillow can become compressed or mold to the shape of the head, but it does not exhibit vibration. A box of candy does not inherently exhibit vibration, although it is possible for it to vibrate if an external force is applied."
