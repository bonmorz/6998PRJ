Option (A), the salt from the ocean, is incorrect as salt content does not directly impact the strength of a hurricane. Option (B), the ocean being quite wet, is also incorrect as all hurricanes form over warm ocean waters, which are indeed wet but not the primary factor in their growth. Option (D), the sea being cool and calm, is incorrect because hurricanes require warm ocean temperatures to form and strengthen.\n\nThe correct answer is (C), seas have humidity from raised temperatures and fluid. As a hurricane moves over warm ocean waters, the warm air from the ocean evaporates and rises, carrying moisture and humidity with it. This moist air then condenses, forming clouds and releasing heat, which provides energy to the hurricane, causing it to intensify and grow stronger. Additionally, the fluid nature of the ocean allows for the transfer of heat and moisture to the hurricane, further fueling its development.\n\nTherefore, the raised temperatures and fluid in the ocean contribute to the humidity and energy that a hurricane gains as it moves over the ocean, leading to its growth and intensification before it reaches the east coast."
