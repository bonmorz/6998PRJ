Polar bears live in the Arctic regions where it is cold and there is plenty of ice and snow. Option (A) would be the most suitable for a polar bear because it would allow them to live in their natural environment where they can build igloos for shelter. Option (B) is incorrect because fake snow in the desert would not provide the necessary conditions for a polar bear to thrive. Option (C) is incorrect because kangaroos do not live in the same habitat as polar bears. Option (D) is incorrect because polar bears are adapted to cold climates and a heated house would not provide the ideal conditions for them."
