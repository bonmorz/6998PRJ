Muscles are attached to bones by tendons and when they contract, they pull on the bones, causing movement. Option (A) shaking your head in frustration involves the contraction of neck muscles which pull on the bones of the neck to generate the movement. Options (B), (C), and (D) do not involve the muscles directly pulling on bones."

Option (A), shaking your head in frustration, is the correct answer. When you shake your head, the muscles in your neck contract and pull on the bones of your skull, allowing the movement. Option (B), rolling your eyes, involves the movement of muscles in your eyes, but it does not involve the pulling of bones. Option (C), wiggling your tongue, also does not involve the pulling of bones. Option (D), wrinkling your nose, involves the contraction of muscles in your nose, but it does not involve the pulling of bones."
