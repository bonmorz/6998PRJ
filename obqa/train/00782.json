The construction of a new suburb usually involves the development of residential areas with houses, roads, and infrastructure. This expansion reduces the available space for natural habitats such as ponds or wetlands where tadpoles commonly live. Therefore, with the construction of a new suburb, there is typically less room for tadpoles. \n\nOptions (B), (C), and (D) are all incorrect. Crime is not directly related to the construction of a suburb, but rather can occur in any area regardless of development. Guns, similarly, are not directly affected by the construction of a suburb, as they are controlled by laws and regulations. Finally, the availability of air is not affected by the construction of a suburb, as air exists in the surrounding environment and is not restricted by residential development."
