The spinal cord is a long, thin, tubular bundle of nervous tissue that extends from the base of the brain and runs down the vertebral column. It is made up of specialized cells called neurons, which are electrically excitable cells that transmit signals. Option (B) is incorrect because nerve gas is a toxic substance and not a component of the spinal cord. Option (C) is incorrect because while biological impulses are carried by neurons, they are not a physical component of the spinal cord itself. Option (D) is incorrect because hair follicles are not a part of the spinal cord."
