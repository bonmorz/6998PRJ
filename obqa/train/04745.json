Lions and hyenas are known to be in opposition to each other in terms of food and territory. They are both apex predators and often compete for the same resources, leading to conflicts between the two species. Option (A) is incorrect because while cats may hunt mice, they are not necessarily in opposition to each other for food. Option (B) is unrelated as dogs and sycamores do not have any natural opposition. Option (C) is also incorrect because while bears do prey on salmon, they are not in direct opposition to each other."

Lions and hyenas are known to be fierce competitors and are often in opposition to each other when it comes to hunting and scavenging for food. Option (A) is incorrect because while cats may hunt mice, they are not necessarily in opposition for similar chow as they have different diets. Option (B) is unrelated as dogs and sycamores are not in competition for food. Option (C) is incorrect because bears and salmon do not directly compete for the same type of food, as bears also consume other food sources."
