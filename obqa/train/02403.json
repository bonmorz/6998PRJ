Option (A) is the best condition to drive in because heavy snowfall, although challenging, can be managed by using appropriate winter tires and driving techniques. Cold weather alone does not necessarily pose a safety risk for driving. Option (B) is incorrect because blizzard conditions and hurricanes both involve strong winds and reduced visibility, making driving extremely dangerous. Option (C) is also incorrect because lightning is associated with thunderstorms, which can cause poor visibility and hazardous driving conditions.
