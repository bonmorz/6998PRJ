Generally, bears with more weight are better suited to survive because they have more fat reserves, which they can rely on for energy during hibernation. Option (A) is incorrect because bears cannot fly. Option (B) is untrue because bears with more weight have more energy reserves and are less likely to starve. Option (D) is also incorrect because weight does not determine aggression or the likelihood of causing harm."

In preparation for winter, bears try to gain weight in order to survive the months of hibernation. The more weight a bear has, the more fat it has stored in its body, which it can rely on for energy during hibernation. Therefore, the bear with the most weight is better suited to survive the winter. Option (A) is incorrect as bears cannot fly. Option (B) is also incorrect as the bear with more weight would have more energy reserves to rely on during hibernation. Option (D) is not necessarily true as it depends on the behavior of the individual bears and not directly related to their weight."
