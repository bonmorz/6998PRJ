Option (A) is correct because sand is formed through the process of weathering. Over time, rocks are broken down and eroded into smaller particles, eventually forming sand. Option (B) is incorrect because sharp boulders do not represent weathering, but rather the result of weathering, such as erosion. Option (C) is incorrect because tall trees do not represent weathering, but rather the result of favorable environmental conditions for tree growth.
