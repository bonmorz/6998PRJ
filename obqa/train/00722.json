Option (A) states that the outline of ribs is clearly visible on starving mammals. This observation indicates that when the amount of food an animal eats decreases, it becomes thinner. This is because when an animal does not consume enough food, its body starts to utilize stored fat and muscle for energy, resulting in a thinner appearance and the visibility of its ribs. \n\nOption (B) is incorrect because it generalizes thin organisms as usually being invertebrates, which is not accurate. Thinness can be observed in both invertebrates and vertebrates. \n\nOption (C) is incorrect because it suggests that all thin animals lack proper nutrition, which is not necessarily true. Some animals have naturally slender builds or may have specific adaptations that allow them to maintain a thin body structure. Proper nutrition is important for overall health, but thinness alone does not indicate a lack of proper nutrition. \n\nOption (D) is also incorrect because it states that animals that have little food are dying. While a lack of food can lead to starvation and potentially death in severe cases, not all animals with limited food resources are dying. Some animals may have adapted to survive in environments with scarce food sources. \n\nTherefore, option (A) provides the most accurate observation that supports the relationship between decreased food consumption and thinness in animals."
