Option (C) is unlikely because automobiles did not exist 2000 years ago.

This is the most likely method that would have brought sand from the coast to the desert 2000 years ago. Over time, wind can carry sand particles and deposit them in different locations. In this case, constant breezes would have blown sand particles from the coast and transported them to the desert, providing a natural method for the sand to be brought from one place to another."
