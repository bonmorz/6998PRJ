When light hits a surface with aluminum, it reflects off the surface and bounces back. This is because aluminum is a highly reflective material. Option (A) is incorrect because something painted black would absorb light, not reflect it. Option (C) is incorrect because water condensation does not cause light to bounce off an object, but it may cause refraction or scattering of light. Option (D) is incorrect because springs and coils do not have the properties necessary to reflect light."
