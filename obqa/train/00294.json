The roots of a prickly pear, like most plants, absorb nutrients from the soil below it through their root systems. Option (B) is incorrect because plants do not absorb nutrients from far away, they obtain them from the immediate vicinity of their roots. Option (C) is also incorrect because plants do not absorb nutrients from the soil beside them, it is only the soil below them that provides nutrients. Option (D) is incorrect because plants do not absorb nutrients from above, as they do not have the ability to extract nutrients from the air."
