This question requires some understanding of the impact of human activities on animal habitats. When people enter forests to live and build, they often destroy or disrupt the natural habitats of animals. This can lead to animals losing their homes and being displaced. Option (A) is incorrect because animals' homes being turned into shoes is not a concern of animal rights activists, but rather of the fashion industry. Option (B) is unrelated to the impact on animal habitats. Option (C) is incorrect because animals' homes being turned into TVs does not make sense in this context."
