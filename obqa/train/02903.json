Option (C) states that the medallion is made of ferrous metals. Ferrous metals, such as iron, steel, and nickel, are good conductors of electricity. In a thunderstorm, which involves lightning, wearing a medallion made of ferrous metals can increase the risk of being struck by lightning. Option (A) states that the shoes are made of rubber, which is an insulator and can help protect against electric shock. Option (B) states that the medallion is made of plastic products, which are also insulators. Option (D) states that the medallion is made of crystal. Crystal is not a good conductor of electricity and is relatively safe to wear in a thunderstorm. Therefore, option (C) is the worst choice to wear out in a thunderstorm."

When caught in a thunderstorm, it is ideal to wear non-conductive materials to minimize the risk of being struck by lightning. Option (C) is the worst choice in this scenario because ferrous metals are conductive, meaning they can conduct electricity and increase the chances of being struck by lightning.

Option (D) is also a potential answer because crystal is a good conductor of electricity. However, Option (C) is the most accurate choice because ferrous metals, such as iron, are excellent conductors of electricity.
