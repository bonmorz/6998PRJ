Option (C), a freshly made wine, would be the easiest to measure in volume terms. Wine is typically stored and sold in bottles, which have standard volume measurements. Therefore, it would be simple to measure the volume of wine by pouring it into a measuring cup or using the markings on a wine bottle. \n\nOptions (A) and (B), the bumper and wheel of a car, would be difficult to measure in volume terms because they have irregular shapes. Volume is typically measured by calculating the amount of space an object occupies, which is more straightforward for regularly shaped objects. \n\nOption (D), a round soccer ball, would also be difficult to measure in volume terms. While the soccer ball is a regular shape, measuring its volume would require more complex methods, such as using water displacement or specialized equipment, because it is hollow and not a solid object like the other options."
