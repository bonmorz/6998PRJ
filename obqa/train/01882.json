Whales and dolphins are marine mammals and have adaptations to regulate their body temperature in water, such as a thick layer of blubber. Squid are marine invertebrates and do not rely on warm asphalt to regulate their body temperature. Rattlesnakes are ectothermic animals, meaning their body temperature is regulated by external sources. They often rely on warm surfaces, such as asphalt, to help raise their body temperature.

Whales, dolphins, and squid are marine animals that live in water, which is generally cooler than warm asphalt. They have different mechanisms, such as blubber or thick skin, to help them regulate their body temperature in water. Rattlesnakes, on the other hand, are ectothermic reptiles that rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. Warm asphalt can absorb and retain heat from sunlight, making it an ideal surface for rattlesnakes to bask and raise their body temperature. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer."
