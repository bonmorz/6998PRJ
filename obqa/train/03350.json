Option (B) states that overpopulation may result from a boom in reproduction of an organism, which is correct. When organisms reproduce at an extremely high rate, it can lead to overpopulation. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the deaths of many organisms would not cause overpopulation, but rather a decrease in population size. \n\nOption (C) is incorrect because natural predators hunting organisms would actually help control the population, preventing overpopulation. \n\nOption (D) is incorrect because organisms self regulating their population refers to the ability of organisms to naturally balance their population size with the resources available in their environment, which helps prevent overpopulation."
