Option (D) is the correct answer because an elephant ear is a broad, flat surface that can easily absorb sunlight. The large surface area allows for more sunlight to be absorbed compared to the other options. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because a cave is an enclosed space and does not have direct exposure to sunlight. Option (B) is incorrect because an octopus is a marine animal and it does not have any specialized structures for light absorption. Option (C) is incorrect because a bat is a mammal that is active during the nighttime and therefore does not rely on sunlight for energy."
