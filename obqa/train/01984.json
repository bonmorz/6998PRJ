Monkeys, like many other mammals, undergo a process called moulting, where they shed their old fur and grow new fur. Option (A), frog, is incorrect because frogs do not shed their skin, but instead, they undergo a process called molting, where they shed the outer layer of their skin. Option (C), chicken, is incorrect because chickens do not shed their feathers, but they may lose or replace individual feathers throughout their lifetime. Option (D), salmon, is incorrect because salmon do not shed their scales."
