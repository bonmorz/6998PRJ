For a circuit to be complete, it needs to have a continuous path from the power source to the load and back to the power source. In this case, a bird's eye, a dog's paw, and a wooden ruler do not conduct electricity and cannot be part of a circuit. However, a phone's keys can potentially complete a circuit because they are made of conductive materials (such as metal) and can allow the electric current to flow.
