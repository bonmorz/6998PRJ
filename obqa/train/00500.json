Viruses can be killed by objects used in a kitchen because many kitchen objects have properties or can be used in ways that can kill viruses. For example, heat from cooking or boiling can kill many types of viruses. Cleaning agents such as bleach or soap can also kill viruses when used properly. Option (A) is incorrect because objects in a backyard may not have the same properties or uses that can kill viruses. Option (B) is also incorrect because while objects in a bathroom can help maintain hygiene, they may not necessarily be able to kill viruses. Option (D) is incorrect because objects in a living room are typically furniture or decorative items that do not have properties to kill viruses."
