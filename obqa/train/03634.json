Algae are aquatic organisms that thrive in water environments such as lakes, deltas, and oceans. These environments provide sufficient water and nutrients for algae to survive. However, in the desert, where moisture is limited and water availability is scarce, algae would likely not be able to receive the necessary resources for survival and would likely die.

Algae is a type of aquatic organism that requires water to survive. Predators of algae can include other aquatic organisms such as zooplankton or fish. \n\nOption (A) states \"a lake.\" While a lake is a body of water and provides a suitable habitat for algae, it is not necessarily safe from predators. Depending on the specific predators present in the lake, the algae may still be at risk of predation.\n\nOption (B) states \"a delta.\" A delta is an area where a river meets a body of water, usually the ocean or a lake. Similar to option (A), a delta can provide a suitable habitat for algae but may still have predators present.\n\nOption (C) states \"the ocean.\" The ocean is a vast body of water, and many predators inhabit it. It is unlikely that algae would be safe from predators in the ocean since there are numerous marine organisms that can feed on algae.\n\nOption (D) states \"the desert.\" This is the correct answer. The desert is a dry and arid environment where water is scarce. Algae requires water to survive and grow. In the desert, there would be a lack of suitable water sources for the algae to thrive. While there may not be predators present, the lack of water would likely cause the algae to die.\n\nIn summary, option (D) is the correct answer because while the algae would be safe from predators, it would likely die due to the lack of water in the desert environment."
