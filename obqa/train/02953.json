Inherited characteristics are traits that are passed down from parent organisms to their offspring through genes. \n\nOption (A) is correct because the color of the vision organ, specifically the iris, is an inherited characteristic. The color of the iris is determined by the amount and type of pigment present in the cells of the iris. This pigmentation is determined by the genes inherited from our parents.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because the color of wallpaper is not an inherited characteristic. It is a design choice made by individuals and has no genetic basis.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because the color of blood is not an inherited characteristic. The color of blood is determined by the presence of red blood cells which contain a pigment called hemoglobin.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the color of dirt is not an inherited characteristic. The color of dirt varies depending on factors such as the composition of the soil and the presence of minerals, and it is not passed down through genes."
