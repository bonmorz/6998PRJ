Option (D) is the correct answer because hummingbirds are known to feed on nectar from flowers and inadvertently spread pollen from flower to flower. This process, called pollination, leads to the production of seeds. Option (A) is incorrect because cars are not living organisms and cannot spread seeds. Option (B) is incorrect because sun beams are not capable of spreading seeds. Option (C) is incorrect because whales do not interact with plants in a way that would spread seeds."

A hummingbird is likely to spread seeds because they often feed on nectar from flowers and inadvertently pick up pollen on their feathers. As they move from flower to flower, they transfer the pollen and help with pollination. Additionally, hummingbirds may also pick up seeds on their feathers or beaks and carry them to new locations, aiding in seed dispersal. Options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because they do not have mechanisms for seed dispersal."

Option (C) a whale is incorrect because whales do not have any direct role in seed dispersal. Option (D) a hummingbird is the correct answer because hummingbirds have long beaks that allow them to reach inside flowers and feed on nectar. While doing so, they inadvertently carry pollen from one flower to another, enabling pollination and seed production. As they move from flower to flower, they contribute to the spread of seeds. Therefore, a hummingbird is likely to spread seeds."
