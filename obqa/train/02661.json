Each year, a tree adds a new layer of wood under its bark, forming a distinct ring. By counting these rings, known as growth rings, we can estimate the age of the tree. Each growth ring represents one year of the tree's life.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the number of branches a tree has does not necessarily correlate with its age. Some trees may have more branches due to environmental factors or pruning. Option (C) is also incorrect because the number of leaves a tree has can vary based on its species, health, and environmental conditions. Option (D) is unrelated to determining the age of a tree, as the roots do not provide any visible indications of its age."
