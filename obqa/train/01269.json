Torrential downpours can cause excessive erosion and saturation of the soil, leading to instability in the hillside. This makes the hillside prone to landslides or slope failures, making it unstable. Option (A) is incorrect because while erosion may cause the hillside to change in shape, it does not become \"depressed\" in the sense of becoming sad. Option (B) is unrelated because the hardness of rocks does not change due to rain. Option (C) is incorrect because while rainfall can promote growth of vegetation, it does not necessarily make the hillside \"greener,\" as it depends on the existing plant species and their response to water."
