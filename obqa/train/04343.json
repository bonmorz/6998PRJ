When you flick an empty glass of water with your finger, it will make a sound. This is because the flick creates vibrations in the glass, which travel through the air as sound waves, reaching our ears and allowing us to hear the sound. Option (A) is incorrect because flicking an empty glass will not fill it up with water. Option (B) is incorrect because flicking an empty glass will not cause it to burst into flames. Option (D) is incorrect because flicking an empty glass will not cause the water to evaporate."
