Winter storms can be harsh and dangerous for bears, especially for young cubs who are not yet fully adapted to extreme weather conditions. The cub that goes outside the den is more likely to face the harsh conditions and therefore is unlikely to survive. Option (A) is incorrect because going outside in a winter storm exposes the cub to colder temperatures. Option (B) is incorrect because it states the obvious fact that the cub outside is not in the den. Option (D) is incorrect because the cub outside is not physically closer to the mother at that moment."

Option (A) is incorrect because being outside in a winter storm would make the cub colder.
