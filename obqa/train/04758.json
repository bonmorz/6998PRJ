An electrical conductor is a material that allows the flow of electrical current. Wood (option A) and rubber (option D) are examples of electrical insulators, which means they do not allow the flow of electricity. Ice (option B) can act as a conductor if it contains impurities or is exposed to electrolytes, but it is generally a poor conductor. A coin (option C) is often made of metal, which is an excellent conductor of electricity. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer."
