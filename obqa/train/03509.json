The reason it can be summer one day and fall another day is because of the Earth's position compared to the sun. The Earth is tilted on its axis, and as it orbits around the sun, different parts of the Earth receive different amounts of sunlight. When a particular region is tilted towards the sun, it experiences summer, and when it is tilted away from the sun, it experiences fall. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. \n\nOption (B) is incorrect because rain can occur in any season and does not determine whether it is summer or fall. Option (C) is incorrect because leaves falling from trees is a characteristic of fall but is not the reason why it might be fall on one day. Option (D) is irrelevant to the seasonal change and is related to the behavior of squirrels."
