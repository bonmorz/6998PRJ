However, without specific information about the ingredients and their boiling points, it is difficult to determine if a cup of tacos would boil.\n\nOption (C) - a cup of plasma: Plasma is a state of matter that consists of ionized gas. It typically requires extremely high temperatures to exist, well above boiling point. Therefore, a cup of plasma would not boil at normal temperatures.\n\nOption (D) - a cup of Earl Grey: Earl Grey is a type of tea.
