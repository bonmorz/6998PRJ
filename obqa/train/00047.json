The correct answer is (B) - the moon's surface contains large cavities called craters, which are caused by impact from meteorites and asteroids. Option (A) is incorrect because the moon's surface is not smooth throughout, it is covered in craters and other features. Option (C) is a joke response, since the moon does not have an internal core of cheese. Option (D) is also incorrect because the moon does not have lakes."
