Mechanical weathering is the process by which rocks and minerals are physically broken down into smaller pieces without any chemical changes. One of the main causes of mechanical weathering is the expansion and contraction of water as it freezes and thaws within cracks and crevices in rocks, known as frost wedging. This process is particularly effective in moist and cold environments. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) giant ice river. Option (A) is incorrect because wind turbines are not a cause of mechanical weathering. Option (B) is incorrect because solar panels do not cause mechanical weathering.

Mechanical weathering refers to the physical breakdown of rocks into smaller pieces without changing their composition. One of the main causes of mechanical weathering is the freeze-thaw cycle, which occurs when water seeps into cracks in rocks and freezes, causing the ice to expand and put pressure on the rocks, eventually leading to their breakdown. This process is commonly seen in areas with cold climates and where there are glaciers or rivers that freeze during winter, which is why option (D) - giant ice river - is the correct answer. Options (A) and (B) are unrelated to mechanical weathering and are more related to renewable energy sources. Option (C) is unrelated to weathering and is instead a made-up term."
