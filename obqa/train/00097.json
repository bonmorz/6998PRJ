Winter and Autumn are two distinct seasons, and the question is asking about the time period between the falling leaves of Autumn and the arrival of winter snow.

Option (C) is too long of a time frame, as winter arrives sooner than three years. Option (D) is incorrect because it states 12 months, which is equivalent to a year but does not give a specific time frame after Autumn."
