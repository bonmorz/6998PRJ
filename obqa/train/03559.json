The solstice with the longest day occurs in the month after June. June is the month of the summer solstice, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted closest to the sun, resulting in the longest day of the year. Following June is July, so the correct answer is option (B) - May. Option (A) is incorrect because November is several months after June. Option (C) is incorrect because January is several months before June. Option (D) is incorrect for the same reason, as March is also several months before June."
