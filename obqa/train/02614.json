Clear weather typically means that there are no clouds in the sky, resulting in a cloudless and sunny day. Option (A) is incorrect because clear weather does not indicate rain. Option (C) is incorrect because snow is associated with cold weather conditions. Option (D) is also incorrect because big clouds can indicate storms or precipitation, which is not characteristic of clear weather."
