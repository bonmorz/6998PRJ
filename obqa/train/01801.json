When water vapor in the air cools and condenses, it forms tiny water droplets or ice crystals, which make up a cloud. These droplets or crystals continue to condense as more water vapor is added to the cloud. Eventually, the cloud becomes \"fat\" or \"heavy\" with water droplets or ice crystals and can no longer hold them, leading to precipitation. Option (A) is incorrect because precipitation does not destroy clouds, but rather is a result of the cloud becoming saturated with moisture. Option (B) is not a reason why a cloud becomes fat and heavy, but rather a characteristic of clouds.
