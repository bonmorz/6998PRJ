During winter, the continents in the northern hemisphere are tilted away from the sun, causing them to be distant from the sun's direct rays.

Option (C) is incorrect because the continents nearest the sun would also be closer to the equator, which generally experiences warmer temperatures and is not experiencing winter. Option (D) is subjective and not related to the scientific explanation of winter."
