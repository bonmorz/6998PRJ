Complex carbohydrates, such as those found in grains and vegetables, are a source of energy for the body. Animals need to burn or metabolize these complex carbohydrates in order to have the energy necessary to move and engage in physical activities. Option (A) is incorrect because staying up or staying awake does not directly require the burning of complex carbohydrates. Option (C) is incorrect because sitting does not require a high amount of energy. Option (D) is incorrect because sleeping actually requires a decrease in energy expenditure."
