Option (D) is the correct answer because ice can form on roads during winter, which can cause cracks and damage to the pavement. When the ice melts, it can further deteriorate the road surface and create potholes. Repaving roads in the spring helps to repair and maintain the road infrastructure after the effects of winter. Option (A) is incorrect because roads needing repaving in the spring is not directly related to their temperature. Option (B) is subjective and does not provide a valid reason for why roads need repaving. Option (C) might be a reason in some cases, but it is not as universally applicable as ice damage."

In the winter, roads can be subject to freezing and thawing cycles, which can cause cracks and potholes to form.
