When a cloud becomes fat, heavy, and dark, it indicates that it is heavily saturated with water vapor and is likely to release that water in the form of precipitation. Therefore, the next step to expect would be precipitation. Option (A) is incorrect because the process of forming ice crystals within a cloud would not occur immediately after it becomes fat and heavy.
