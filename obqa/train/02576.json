Sharks use gills to extract oxygen from the water, allowing them to swim underwater for longer periods of time. Humans, on the other hand, do not have gills and use lungs to extract oxygen from the air. Option (A) is the correct answer because it accurately describes the difference between sharks and humans in terms of their ability to extract oxygen while underwater. Option (B) and (C) are incorrect because humans do not use gills and do not extract carbon from the water. Option (D) is incorrect because sharks are able to find oxygen while underwater through their gills."

Instead, humans have lungs and need to hold their breath or use scuba gear to stay underwater for extended periods. Therefore, option (B) and option (C) are both incorrect.
