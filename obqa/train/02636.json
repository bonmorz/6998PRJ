In order for something to function using electrical energy, it needs to be plugged into a source of electricity. Option (A) is incorrect because the sun does not require electricity to function, it provides energy through other means. Option (B) is incorrect because grass does not require electrical energy to function, it obtains energy through photosynthesis. Option (D) is incorrect because a lake does not require electrical energy to function, it operates naturally. Option (C) is the correct answer because a Dyson, which is likely referring to a Dyson vacuum cleaner, requires electrical energy in order to function properly."
