In the desert, temperatures often drop significantly at night, so animals need to conserve energy and minimize water loss. Option (A) is correct because in cooler temperatures, animals require less liquid to consume in order to avoid dehydration. Option (B) is incorrect because animals still need to eat to survive, although their food sources may be limited in the desert. Option (C) is incorrect because animals still need warmth to regulate their body temperature, especially in cold desert nights. Option (D) is incorrect because hunting may still be necessary for survival, and packmates can help in capturing prey."
