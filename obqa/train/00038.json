Acid rain refers to rainfall or any form of precipitation with a pH level below 5.6, which is considered acidic. Acid rain can have harmful effects on aquatic environments.\n\nOption (A) is correct because acid rain can lead to a decrease in plant life. Acidic water can damage plant cells, inhibit photosynthesis, and interfere with nutrient absorption, leading to a decline in plant growth and overall plant health.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because acid rain can have detrimental effects on fish populations. Acidic water can directly harm fish by causing gill damage and impairing their ability to breathe. It can also indirectly affect fish by reducing food sources and the habitat quality for fish, leading to a decrease in fish population.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because acid rain does not typically increase plant growth. As mentioned earlier, acid rain can damage plant cells and inhibit their ability to absorb nutrients and conduct photosynthesis. This can result in stunted growth or even death of plants.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because acid rain does not make water cleaner and clearer. In fact, acid rain can make water bodies more acidic and introduce chemical pollutants, which can make the water less clear and negatively impact aquatic organisms.\n\nIn summary, based on the effects of acid rain on aquatic environments, the most likely effect would be a decrease in plant life (option A)."

Acid rain refers to rain or any other form of precipitation that has an unusually low pH level, usually due to the presence of pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in the atmosphere. \n\nAcid rain can have detrimental effects on aquatic environments. It can lead to a decrease in plant life due to several reasons. Firstly, the acid in the rain can directly damage the leaves and stems of plants, inhibiting their growth and eventually causing them to die. Secondly, acid rain can also cause the pH of the water bodies to become more acidic, which is unfavorable for plant growth. Many aquatic plants require a specific pH range to thrive, and acidification of the water can disrupt their metabolism and nutrient absorption, leading to a decline in their population. \n\nOption (B) is incorrect because acid rain does not typically lead to an increase in fish population. The acidic conditions can be harmful to fish health, impacting their ability to reproduce, grow, and survive. Option (C) is also incorrect as increased plant growth is unlikely due to the reasons mentioned above. Option (D) is misleading because even though acid rain can remove some particulate matter, it has adverse effects on water quality due to increased acidity."

Acid rain is characterized by having a low pH due to high concentrations of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere, which dissolve in rainwater. When acid rain falls into bodies of water such as lakes or rivers, it can have several harmful effects.\n\nOption (A) - decrease in plant life: This is the correct answer. Acid rain can lower the pH of the water, making it more acidic.

Acidic conditions caused by acid rain are not conducive to plant growth. Instead, they can harm plants and inhibit their growth.\n\nOption (D) - cleaner and clearer water: This is incorrect. Acid rain can actually make water bodies cloudy and murky. The acidity can cause the release of aluminum from soils, which can make the water appear muddy and discolored.\n\nTherefore, the most likely effect of acid rain on an aquatic environment is a decrease in plant life."
