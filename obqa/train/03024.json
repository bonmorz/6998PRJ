This is because vinegar is less dense than the toy submarine, causing it to float. The buoyant force exerted by the vinegar pushes the toy submarine up, and when it reaches the surface, gravity pulls it back down. Options (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect because none of these substances would cause the toy submarine to float or bob up and down. Rice, ice, and sand are all more dense than the toy submarine, so it would sink in them rather than floating."
