When an animal is living in an environment lacking in food resources, it will likely be in poor shape. This is because it is not getting enough nutrients and energy from its diet, which can lead to malnutrition and physical decline. Option (B) is incorrect because if an animal is lacking food resources, it will not be thriving and lively. Option (C) is not necessarily true for all animals in this situation, as some may have to adapt to a new diet while others may not have that option. Option (D) is incorrect because hibernation is a specific adaptive strategy used by some animals in response to seasonal changes, not necessarily as a response to a lack of food."
