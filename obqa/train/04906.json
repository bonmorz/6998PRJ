When an animal contracts any kind of illness, it will inevitably experience a decline in its physical health. Illnesses can weaken the immune system, cause fatigue, loss of appetite, physical pain, and other symptoms that negatively impact the overall health of the animal. Option (B) is incorrect because without proper treatment or intervention, the animal's physical health is unlikely to improve on its own. Option (C) is not applicable as \"flying away\" is not a relevant response to illness. Option (D) is also incorrect as the animal's physical health will definitely be affected by the illness."
