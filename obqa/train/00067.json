Option (A), a backpack, is not a natural physical attribute of an animal and would not provide any intrinsic protection to its inner parts. Option (C) states that none of the options are correct, but this is not true as there is a correct answer. Option (D), a shell of cotton, is also not a natural attribute of an animal and would not offer effective protection. \n\nOption (B), a calcium fortified internal structure, is the correct answer. Many animals, such as vertebrates, have skeletal systems made of calcium-rich bones or cartilage. This internal structure helps protect the vital organs and other internal parts of the animal. Calcium provides strength and rigidity to the structure, making it more resistant to external forces and potential injuries. Therefore, having a calcium fortified internal structure would better protect an animal's inner parts compared to the other options."
