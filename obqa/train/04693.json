Gravity is a non-contact force, meaning it does not require physical contact between objects to occur. It is the force that attracts objects towards each other based on their mass. Option (A) is incorrect because magnetic force is a different type of force that is generated by magnets. Option (B) is incorrect because speed is a measure of how fast an object is moving and not a force. Option (C) is incorrect because contact force refers to forces that occur when objects come into physical contact with each other."
