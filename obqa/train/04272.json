Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are non-renewable resources that contribute to air pollution and climate change. Avoiding fossil fuel usage refers to using alternative sources of energy, such as solar or wind power, which are more sustainable and environmentally friendly. Option (A), keeping natural, aligns with the idea of preserving the natural resources and reducing harm to the environment. Option (B), destroying, is incorrect because avoiding fossil fuel usage aims to protect the environment rather than destroy it. Option (C), eliminating, is also incorrect because while reducing fossil fuel usage is desirable, complete elimination may not be feasible or practical in certain situations. Option (D), burning, is incorrect because it refers to the activity of using fossil fuels, which is the opposite of avoiding fossil fuel usage."
