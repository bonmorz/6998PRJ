Frogs have a unique feature called \"tympanic membranes\" or eardrums, which allow them to detect sound and vibrations in their environment. However, unlike humans, frogs do not have external ears, making their eardrums less susceptible to damage from loud noises. Option (A) is incorrect because croaking sounds are produced by the frogs themselves, not a feature that helps them withstand noisy areas. Option (B) is unrelated to the ability to withstand noise. Option (D) is incorrect because slimy skin does not play a role in their ability to tolerate noise."
