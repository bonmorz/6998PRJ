In the Northern Hemisphere, the summer solstice occurs around June 21st, marking the longest day of the year. From that point on, the amount of daylight starts to decrease. \n\nOption (A), October, is approximately four months after June and therefore, does not align with the statement that the most daylight is two months after.\n\nOption (B), July, is the month of the summer solstice and is not two months after.\n\nOption (C), January, is the month of the winter solstice, which is the shortest day of the year. Two months after January would be March, which does not align with the statement that the most daylight is two months after.\n\nThus, the correct answer is (D) April. Two months after the winter solstice in December (which is the shortest day of the year) is February. Continuing two months forward from February, we reach April, where the daylight starts to increase significantly as we approach the summer solstice."
