While the exact length may vary from person to person, on average, the blood vessels in the circulatory system are long enough to be wrapped around the Earth multiple times. Option (B) and Option (C) are incorrect because the length of the circulatory system is not equivalent to the length of a specific object like a horse or the universe.

The circulatory system consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. The blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries, stretch throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to cells and removing waste products. If you were to measure the length of all the blood vessels in the body and stretch them out, they would be long enough to wrap around the earth multiple times. Option (B) is incorrect because the length of a horse is much shorter. Option (C) and Option (D) are both incorrect because neither the circulatory system nor the universe has a defined length."
