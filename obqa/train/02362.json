Flowers typically do not grow tall enough or have enough foliage to provide significant shade.\n\nOption (B) making money: Making money is not a viable solution for regaining shade. Money does not directly relate to shade.\n\nOption (C) acquiring seeds: This is the correct answer. By acquiring seeds and planting new trees, the people can eventually regain shade. Trees take time to grow, but by planting seeds, they can start the process of growing new trees that will provide shade in the future.\n\nOption (D) tilling gardens: Tilling gardens does not directly relate to regaining shade. Tilling gardens refers to preparing the soil for planting, but it does not ensure the growth of trees that will provide shade.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C), acquiring seeds, as it is the most logical and effective way to regain shade after a tree falls down."
