The composition of bread is different from the Earth's composition and does not contain similar components.\nOption (C) - a can of soup: Soup is a mixture of various ingredients, including water, vegetables, meat or other proteins, and seasonings. While water is found on Earth, the other components of soup, such as vegetables and proteins, are not similar to the composition of the Earth.\nOption (D) - a glass of water: Water is a compound composed of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
