Option (D) is correct because the native worm population can help loosen the soil as they burrow through it. Worms create channels in the soil, allowing for better water and air movement, which results in a more loosely packed soil. Options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because they mention populations that are unrelated to soil structure."
