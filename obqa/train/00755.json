The correct answer is (C) third because, typically, the planet that contains many ecosystems (including diverse habitats and ecosystems) is Earth, and it is positioned third from the center of our solar system. Option (A) is incorrect because it is often Jupiter that is the fifth planet from the center. Option (B) is incorrect because Mercury is the closest planet to the center, but it does not contain many ecosystems. Option (D) is incorrect because Mars is the fourth planet from the center, but it does not contain as many ecosystems as Earth."
