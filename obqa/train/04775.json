Animals adapt to their environment or their natural surroundings. This includes factors such as climate, habitat, food availability, and other physical and biological factors within their natural habitat. Option (A) is incorrect because while animals may adapt in appearance to blend in with their environment, this is just one aspect of adaptation. Option (B) is too specific and only refers to a body part. Option (C) is also too specific and only refers to the skin, whereas animals can adapt in various other ways as well. Option (D) is the most comprehensive and accurate answer as it encompasses all aspects of an animal's natural surroundings that they may adapt to."
