A producer, such as a plant, is able to make its own sustenance through the process of photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose (a form of sugar) and oxygen. Option (B) is incorrect because producers do not produce their own air, they release oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis. Option (C) is incorrect because producers do not create their own shelter. Option (D) is incorrect because producers are not capable of creating their own body, they rely on nutrients from their surroundings to grow and develop."

Producers, such as plants and certain types of bacteria, make their own sustenance through the process of photosynthesis or chemosynthesis.
