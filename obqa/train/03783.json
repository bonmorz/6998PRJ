A sea cow, also known as a manatee, is a marine mammal that primarily inhabits coastal waters, rivers, estuaries, and other shallow, warm environments. They are not adapted to survive in desert environments, which are arid and lack the necessary resources for a sea cow to thrive. Option (B) is incorrect because a fjord is a narrow coastal inlet with steep sides, which could potentially provide a suitable habitat for a sea cow. Option (C) is also incorrect because an ocean park could potentially provide suitable conditions for a sea cow. Option (D) is incorrect because sea cows are perfectly comfortable in lots of water, as long as it is in their preferred habitat."

Sea cows, also known as manatees, are aquatic mammals that typically inhabit warm coastal waters and rivers. They are adapted to living in water and require a constant source of water to survive. \n\nOption (A) states that a sea cow would be most uncomfortable in a desert. This option is correct because deserts are characterized by extremely dry conditions and lack of accessible water sources. Sea cows would not be able to survive in such an environment without access to water.\n\nOption (B) states that a sea cow would be uncomfortable in a fjord. This option is incorrect because fjords are coastal areas with deep, cold waters, which can be a suitable habitat for sea cows.\n\nOption (C) states that a sea cow would be uncomfortable in an ocean park. This option is incorrect because an ocean park typically provides a controlled and suitable environment for marine animals like sea cows, with access to water and appropriate conditions.\n\nOption (D) states that a sea cow would be uncomfortable with lots of water. This option is incorrect because sea cows are adapted to living in aquatic environments and require a significant amount of water to survive.\n\nOverall, the correct answer is option (A) because a sea cow would be most uncomfortable in a desert due to the lack of accessible water sources."
