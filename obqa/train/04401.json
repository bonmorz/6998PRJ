Wolves are known predators and voles are small mammals that serve as a food source for them. Option (A) is incorrect because birds and giraffes have different dietary preferences and do not typically interact in that way. Option (B) is incorrect because dandelions are plants and do not eat worms. Option (C) is also incorrect because petunias are plants and do not devour mice."
