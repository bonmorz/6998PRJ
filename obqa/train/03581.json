Option (B) is the correct answer because reducing ethanol use conserves natural resources. Ethanol is typically made from crops such as corn or sugarcane, and the production of ethanol requires significant amounts of land, water, and energy. By reducing ethanol use, we conserve these resources for other purposes. \n\nOptions (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect because they do not directly relate to conservation. Jogging, hiking, and raking leaves may all have environmental benefits, such as promoting fitness or maintaining a clean environment, but they are not specific examples of conservation."
