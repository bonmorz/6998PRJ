When a cat has a body temperature that is below average, it indicates that the cat is in danger. This is because cats, like many other animals, have a specific range of body temperature that is necessary for their bodily functions to work properly. If their body temperature drops below this range, it can be a sign of illness or other health issues. Option (A) is incorrect because a below-average body temperature is not indicative of good health. Option (B) is subjective and not related to the cat's temperature. Option (D) is inaccurate because a below-average body temperature is outside of the safe range for a cat."
