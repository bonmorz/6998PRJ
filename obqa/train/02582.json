Earthquakes are natural phenomena that occur when there is a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust, resulting in shaking and sometimes causing damage to buildings and infrastructure. Option (C) is the correct answer because earthquakes can cause the ground to shake and buildings to collapse, which may require people to move to safer locations. Options (A), (B), and (D) are not related to the effects of earthquakes. Option (A) is unrelated because earthquakes have no connection to the Olympics. Option (B) is unrealistic because cracks in the ground during an earthquake do not release cats. Option (D) introduces a magical element that is not associated with earthquakes."
