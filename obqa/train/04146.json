After a storm, creek beds may be spilling over because the heavy rainfall can cause an increase in water levels and overflow from the natural water channels.

Option (B) is possible if the storm is severe enough to cause significant evaporation, but it is not a guaranteed outcome. Option (D) is not directly related to storms, as flowers can wilt and wither due to a variety of factors."
