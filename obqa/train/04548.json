A renewable source is one that can be replenished or naturally generated in a short period of time, unlike fossil fuels which take millions of years to form. Option (C) refers to the sun, which is a renewable source of energy as it provides us with solar energy. Option (A) is incorrect because electricity from coal power plants is generated using a non-renewable source (coal). Option (B) is incorrect because oils made from whale blubber are not a commonly-used renewable source of energy. Option (D) is incorrect because gasoline made from fossils is derived from non-renewable fossil fuels."
