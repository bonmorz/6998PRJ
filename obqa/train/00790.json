Once it reaches the surface, it is called lava. Option (A) is incorrect as a geyser is a natural hot spring that periodically erupts. Option (B) is correct as a volcano is a geological formation where lava can erupt. Option (C) is partially correct, as magma is below the ground, but it does not capture the transformation into lava once it reaches the surface. Option (D) is the correct answer as lava is the term used for molten rock that has reached the Earth's surface."
