Looking directly at a solar eclipse can harm your eyes and potentially cause permanent damage. The safest way to view a solar eclipse is to use a pinhole projector to project the image onto a screen or surface. This allows you to indirectly view the eclipse without directly looking at the sun. Option (A) is incorrect because using a mirror can actually intensify the brightness of the sunlight and increase the risk of eye damage. Option (C) is incorrect because looking directly at a solar eclipse can cause harm to your eyes. Option (D) is correct because it emphasizes the importance of not looking directly at a solar eclipse."
