When spending a day hiking, it is likely that the skin will become even darker in tone due to sun exposure and the production of melanin. Option (A) is incorrect because spending a day hiking would typically result in a darkening of the skin, not a paling. Option (B) is unrealistic as there is no physiological process that would cause the skin to turn green. Option (D) is incorrect because spending a day hiking does have an effect on the skin."
