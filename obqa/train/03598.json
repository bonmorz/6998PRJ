Many animals migrate to warmer regions during colder months to avoid harsh conditions and find better resources for survival. Option (B) and (C) are not necessarily related to migration as different organisms have different preferences for their habitat. Option (D) is unlikely as organisms generally do not migrate with the intention of freezing."
