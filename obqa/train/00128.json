When a bird is living in a certain segment of the world, it can become part of that environment by adapting to it. This means that the bird develops traits or behaviors that allow it to survive and thrive in that particular environment. Option (A) is incorrect because it refers to reproduction, which is a separate process from adaptation. Option (B) is incorrect because being preyed upon is not the same as becoming part of the environment. Option (D) is incorrect because it refers to predators getting the bird, which is a different concept from adaptation."
