As the truck accelerates and moves away from the man, the sound waves emitted by the truck are compressed and higher in frequency. This leads to the perception that the truck's engine noise is getting louder. However, the visual perception of the truck is affected by the change in distance and the relative speed between the man and the truck. Since the truck is moving away from the man, the visual angle of the truck becomes smaller, making it appear smaller in size. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.

As the truck accelerates and moves away from the man, the sound waves produced by the engine of the truck will have a higher pitch and frequency. This is because the sound waves get compressed as they approach the man and stretch out as they move away. \n\nAccording to the Doppler effect, this change in frequency also affects our perception of the object producing the sound. The change in frequency leads to a change in wavelength and therefore a change in perceived pitch. \n\nIn this case, since the truck is moving away from the man, the waves of light reflecting off the truck are stretched, making the truck appear to have a longer wavelength. This causes the truck to appear smaller to the man as it accelerates and moves away from him. \n\nOption (A) is the correct answer because the truck looks smaller as it moves away from the man due to the Doppler effect. Option (B) is incorrect because the truck actually looks smaller. Option (C) and (D) are unrelated and not relevant to the question."
