Flowers have evolved to attract pollinators such as bees, butterflies, and birds in order to spread their genetic material and reproduce. This is achieved through the process of pollination, where pollen is transferred from the male reproductive organs of one flower to the female reproductive organs of another flower. By spreading their genetic components to other flowers, a flower increases its chances of producing offspring and continuing its species. Option (A) is incorrect because flowers do not have the ability to consciously consider their purpose in living. Option (B) is partially correct, as making new flowers bloom is a way of propagating their species, but it does not encompass the entire point of living for a flower. Option (C) is incorrect because while flowers may provide nectar for bees, their main purpose is not to feed bees and make honey."
