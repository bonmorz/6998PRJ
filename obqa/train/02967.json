Option (A) is the correct answer because sitting near a running boiler would provide warmth and help Lucy warm up. Boilers generate heat, which can help raise the temperature in a room. Option (B) is incorrect because sitting near an iceberg would make Lucy even colder. Option (C) is also incorrect because sitting near a wet towel would not provide warmth.
