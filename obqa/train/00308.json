When the Earth is tilted on its axis, it causes one side (hemisphere) to receive less energy from the Sun than the other side. This is evident in option (A), where during summer in the USA (which is in the Northern Hemisphere), it is winter in Australia (which is in the Southern Hemisphere). This is because the tilted axis causes the Sun's rays to hit the Northern Hemisphere more directly during its summer, while it hits the Southern Hemisphere at a slanted angle, leading to colder temperatures and winter. Option (B) is incorrect because the presence of snow on the North or South Pole is not directly related to the Earth's tilt.

The correct answer is (A) summer in the USA, winter in Australia.\n\nTo explain this, we need to understand the concept of seasons and the Earth's tilt. The Earth is tilted on its axis at an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees. This tilt causes the different seasons throughout the year.\n\nDuring the summer in the USA, the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun, which means that the northern hemisphere is receiving more direct sunlight and therefore more energy from the Sun. This leads to warmer temperatures and longer days in the USA during the summer.\n\nOn the other hand, during the same time, it is winter in Australia. The South Pole is tilted away from the Sun, causing the southern hemisphere to receive less direct sunlight and less energy from the Sun. This results in colder temperatures and shorter days in Australia during the winter.\n\nTherefore, the fact that there is summer in the USA and winter in Australia at the same time is evidence that the Earth's tilt on its axis causes one side of the Earth to receive less energy from the Sun than the other side.\n\nOptions (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because they do not directly explain the specific phenomenon described in the question. While they may be related to seasonal changes and varying temperatures, they do not provide evidence for the Earth's tilt causing one side to receive less energy from the Sun."
