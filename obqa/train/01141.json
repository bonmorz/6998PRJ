Many amphibians, such as tadpoles, start their lives as herbivores and primarily eat algae. As they grow and develop, their diet can change, with some species becoming carnivorous or insectivorous. Option (A) is incorrect because amphibians generally do not eat meat. Option (B) is partially correct as flies may be included in the diet of some amphibians, but it is not the primary food source. Option (C) is incorrect because while beetles may be consumed by certain amphibians, they are not the main food source.  Therefore, the correct answer is option (D) as algae is commonly consumed by many amphibians during their early stages of life."
