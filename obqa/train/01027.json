Cattle are ruminant animals that have a specialized digestive system capable of extracting nutrients from plant material. They can survive on roughage, which includes grass, hay, and other vegetation found in the field. Option (B) is incorrect because cattle are herbivores and do not hunt meat. Option (C) is incorrect because cattle do not rely on insects as a food source. Option (D) is incorrect because cattle are not predators and do not eat prey."
