Option (A) is incorrect because light does not enter the skin through the pupil. Option (C) is not a scientifically accurate description. Option (D) may be relevant to understanding the anatomy of the eye, but it is not the specific structure through which light enters. The correct answer is (B) because the visual organ refers to the eye, which is where light enters through the pupil."
