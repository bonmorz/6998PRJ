Clear cutting refers to the practice of cutting down all trees in an area, which is a human-caused action that can significantly change the environment. Option (A) refers to seasonal storms, which are natural occurrences and not caused by humans. Option (B) refers to annual flooding, which can occur naturally or as a result of human activities such as damming rivers, but it is not specified in the question that it is human-caused. Option (C) refers to natural woodland fires, which are a natural part of many ecosystems and not caused by humans."

Clear cutting refers to the practice of cutting down all trees in an area, typically for logging purposes.

Option (A) refers to seasonal storms, which are natural events and not caused by humans. Option (B) refers to annual flooding, which can be caused by natural factors such as heavy rainfall or snow melt. Option (C) refers to natural woodland fires, which are also a natural part of certain ecosystems and not directly caused by humans."

This process is a human-caused change to the environment because it involves intentional human intervention and can have significant impacts on the ecosystem. Seasonal storms and annual flooding are natural events that can cause temporary changes to the environment, but they are not directly caused by human activity. Natural woodland fires, while they can also cause changes to the environment, are typically part of the natural cycle of forests and are not directly caused by humans. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) clear cutting."
