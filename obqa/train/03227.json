                "content": "This question requires knowledge about thermoregulation in animals. Animals regulate their body temperature in various ways, and one effective method is panting. Panting allows animals to release excess heat through their tongues, which helps to cool them down. Lizards, rabbits, and humans do not regulate their body temperature through panting, so their tongues sticking out would not necessarily indicate overheating. Golden retrievers, on the other hand, are known to pant heavily when they are hot. Therefore, if a golden retriever has its tongue sticking out, it is likely hotter than it should be."

When animals are hot, they often stick out their tongues to release heat through evaporative cooling. A golden retriever is more likely to be hotter than it should be if its tongue is sticking out, as they have a higher tendency to overheat compared to other animals listed. Option (A) is incorrect because lizards often stick out their tongues to smell or gather information, not necessarily due to high body temperature. Option (C) is unlikely because rabbits do not regulate their body temperature by sticking out their tongues. Option (D) is unlikely because humans primarily regulate their body temperature through sweating and other physiological mechanisms, not by sticking out their tongues."

Animals, such as lizards, rely on sticking out their tongues to cool down because they don't have sweat glands. However, golden retrievers and other dogs do have sweat glands, mainly on their paws, so they don't rely on sticking out their tongues to cool down. Therefore, option (B) is incorrect. Rabbits also have mechanisms to regulate their body temperature, and sticking out their tongues is not one of them. Humans have sweat glands all over their bodies and do not rely on sticking out their tongues to cool down either. Therefore, the most likely answer is option (A), a lizard, as they use their tongues to cool down."
