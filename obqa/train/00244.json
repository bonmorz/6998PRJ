Condensation refers to the process of water vapor in the air turning into liquid water, usually when the air becomes colder. When condensation occurs overnight, it can lead to the formation of dew on surfaces such as grass. This dew can make the grass slippery, leading to option (B) being the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because condensation actually adds moisture to the air. Option (C) is incorrect because condensation does not directly cause plant wilting and death. Option (D) is incorrect because black ice forms when supercooled water freezes on a surface, and while condensation is a factor in this process, it is not the direct cause."
