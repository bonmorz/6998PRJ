The sticky balls from a plant likely refer to seeds or fruits with sticky coverings that can attach to animals or objects and be transported to new locations. Option (A) states that a bear unknowingly transported the sticky balls, which is a plausible way for seeds to be dispersed. Option (B) is incorrect because bouncing when they fall does not explain long-distance dispersal. Option (C) is possible as some plants rely on ants to disperse their seeds, but it is not mentioned in the question.
