Therefore, you could expect to see a quail sleeping in a field, as option (B) suggests. Option (A) may be a choice because some quails may sleep in hidden areas like boxes, but it is not the most typical sleeping spot for them. Option (C) is incorrect because quails are land birds and would not sleep in the ocean. Option (D) is incorrect because quails do not typically sleep in trees."
