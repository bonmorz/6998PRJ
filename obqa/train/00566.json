A stopwatch is especially helpful when tracking split times on runs or any activity that requires timing intervals. Option (A) is incorrect because there are other devices like clocks and phones that are more appropriate for ascertaining the current time. Option (C) is also incorrect because alarm clocks are designed for waking up at a specific time, not for tracking intervals. Option (D) is not related to the purpose of a stopwatch, as it is used for measuring time rather than finding answers on a times table test."
