The correct answer is (C) augmented.\n\nExplanation: When the number of organisms in a group increases, the chance of survival for each individual organism is typically augmented or increased. This is because there is safety in numbers. In a larger group, there is a higher likelihood that some individuals will detect and respond to threats or predators, providing a level of protection for the entire group. Additionally, a larger group may have better access to resources, such as food and shelter, which can increase the chances of survival for each individual.\n\nOption (A) \"float\" is incorrect because it does not accurately describe the relationship between the number of organisms and survival chances. Option (B) \"minimal change\" is also incorrect because a larger group generally provides greater chances of survival compared to a smaller group, so there is a noticeable change. Option (D) \"lowered\" is incorrect because as the number of organisms in a group increases, the chances of survival for each individual typically increase rather than decrease."
