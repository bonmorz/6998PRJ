                "content": "This question asks us to identify a simple machine that requires mechanical energy to function. To answer this, we need to have some knowledge about simple machines and how they work. A simple machine is a device that helps make work easier by changing the direction or magnitude of a force applied to it.\n\nOption (A) states that a light needs a crank to be turned. This is a clear example of a simple machine called a crank mechanism. By turning the crank, we are able to convert our mechanical energy into the electrical energy needed to power the light. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.\n\nOption (B) mentions a radio that needs four batteries. While batteries provide energy to power the radio, they do not require mechanical energy to function. Therefore, it is not an example of a simple machine that requires mechanical energy.\n\nOption (C) refers to a computer that needs to be plugged in. Again, this is not an example of a simple machine. While electrical energy is needed to power the computer, plugging it in does not require mechanical energy.\n\nOption (D) states that a stove works on gas. While gas provides the fuel for the stove, it does not require mechanical energy to function. Therefore, it is not an example of a simple machine requiring mechanical energy.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is option (A) because a light that needs a crank to be turned is a clear example of a simple machine that requires mechanical energy to function."
