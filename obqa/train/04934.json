Silver is a highly reflective material, meaning it reflects a large amount of light that comes into contact with it. A car tire (A) and a bath towel (B) are made of materials that do not reflect light well, so they will not reflect as much light as a silver spoon. A sheet of paper (C) is generally white and reflective, but it does not reflect as much light as silver."
