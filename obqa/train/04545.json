Digestion is the process by which our body breaks down food into small molecules that can be absorbed and used for energy, growth, and repair.\n\nOption (A), fire, cannot be digested by the body. Fire is a chemical reaction, and our digestive system is not equipped to break down or use fire as a source of energy.\n\nOption (B), air, is not digested by the body. While air is necessary for respiration, it is not broken down or used for energy production through the process of digestion.\n\nOption (C), twinkies, are likely to be digested by the body. Twinkies are a type of processed food made with numerous ingredients, including carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. These nutrients can be broken down by our digestive system and absorbed by the body for energy.\n\nOption (D), water, is not digested but rather absorbed by the body. Water does not need to go through the same digestive process as other foods. It is absorbed directly into the bloodstream through the cells lining our digestive tract.\n\nTherefore, the most likely option that can be digested by the body is (C) twinkies."
