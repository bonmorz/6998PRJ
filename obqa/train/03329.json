Option (A) is the correct answer because the appearance and disappearance of the sun, which is a large star, is guaranteed to happen every day. Option (B) is incorrect because earthquakes and tornadoes do not occur every day in every location. Option (C) is incorrect because the appearance of a rainbow is dependent on specific weather conditions and a tsunami does not occur every day.

In a 24-hour cycle, a large star appearing and disappearing is guaranteed to happen. This is because the Earth rotates on its axis, causing the appearance and disappearance of stars in the sky as different parts of the Earth face towards or away from them. \n\nOption (B) is incorrect because earthquakes and tornadoes are not guaranteed to happen in a 24-hour cycle. They are natural disasters that occur randomly and are not tied to a specific time frame. \n\nOption (C) is also incorrect because rainbows and tsunamis are not guaranteed to happen in a 24-hour cycle. Rainbows require specific weather conditions, such as rain and sunlight, while tsunamis are rare and occur due to seismic activity in the ocean. \n\nOption (D) is incorrect because a dog barking or a vitamin being eaten are not events that happen on a universal scale within a 24-hour cycle. They are specific to individual instances and do not occur consistently for every person or every day."
