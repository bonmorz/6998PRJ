In this case, the keyword \"kernel\" suggests that the organism in question is a plant that grows from a seed. Option (B) is incorrect because rocks cannot grow or reproduce. Option (C) is incorrect because chairs do not reproduce. Option (D) is incorrect because doves are birds and do not grow from kernels or rely on insects for reproduction. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is (A) carnation, as it is a type of flowering plant that can grow from a seed (kernel) and relies on insects for pollination."
