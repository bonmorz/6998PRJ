When a baby needs to have milk every hour but is only given it every six hours, they will be negatively affected. Babies have small stomachs and high metabolic rates, so they need frequent feedings to meet their nutritional needs. If they are not given milk regularly, they may become hungry, malnourished, and may experience delayed growth. Option (A) is incorrect because the baby will not be glad about the situation. Option (C) is incorrect because the baby will not be positively affected by being deprived of regular feedings. Option (D) is incorrect because being overweight is not a likely outcome of not being fed regularly as a baby."
