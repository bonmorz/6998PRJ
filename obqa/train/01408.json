Terns are seabirds that often migrate to colder regions during certain seasons and are well adapted to survive in cold temperatures. \n\nOption (A) Lizards is incorrect because lizards are ectothermic animals, meaning they rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature and cannot thrive in extremely cold temperatures. \n\nOption (C) Antelope is incorrect because most species of antelope are found in warmer regions and are not well adapted to survive in extremely cold temperatures. \n\nOption (D) Kangaroos is incorrect because kangaroos are native to Australia, which has a predominantly warm climate, and they are not well adapted for cold temperatures."

Many tern species, such as the Arctic Tern and the Common Tern, have migratory patterns that take them to colder regions for breeding and feeding. They have specialized adaptations, such as thick plumage and efficient metabolism, that allow them to survive in harsh cold environments. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."
