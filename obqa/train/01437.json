A seismometer is an instrument used to measure and record earthquakes, as well as other seismic activities such as tremors. It is specifically designed to detect and measure the shaking of the ground caused by seismic waves. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer because a seismometer can provide information about the intensity and magnitude of shaking during an earthquake or other seismic events. Options (A), (C), and (D) are unrelated and do not involve the function or capability of a seismometer."
