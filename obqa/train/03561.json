Option (D) suggests that a running dog could cause damage, but again, this would depend on the size and weight of the dog and the condition of the walkway. \n\nOption (C), a tree nearby, is the most likely answer. Trees have roots that can grow and spread, potentially causing the walkway to crack or lift. As the tree grows, its roots can exert pressure on the walkway, leading to damage over time.
