In this question, it is stated that the person has a black cat in May. Assuming that May is a month where the person is superstitious about black cats, they might be unable to wear something yellow, as yellow is often associated with superstitious symbols of good luck and protection from evil. Options (A), (C), and (D) are all dark colors, but they do not have the same superstitious connotations as the color yellow."

Since the cat is black, wearing black clothing may cause the cat to blend in with the clothing and become difficult to see or locate.

Option (A) is incorrect because dark purple would still provide contrast with the black cat. Option (C) is incorrect because dark grey would also provide contrast with the black cat. Option (D) is incorrect because black clothing would make the cat difficult to see, but it is not specified that you are unable to wear black."
