According to Newton's second law of motion, force is directly proportional to acceleration. This means that adding force to the train will cause it to accelerate and travel further in the same amount of time. Option (B) is incorrect because adding force does not change the size or shape of the train. Option (C) is incorrect because adding force increases the distance the train can travel. Option (D) is incorrect because adding force does not increase the mass of the train."

By applying an additional force to a moving train, we are adding to the net force acting on the train. According to Newton's second law of motion, F = ma, an increase in force will result in an increase in acceleration. This means that the train will be able to cover more distance in the same amount of time, as the added force propels it forward with greater acceleration.

Option (C) is also incorrect because adding force to a moving train will result in it covering more distance, not less, due to increased acceleration.
