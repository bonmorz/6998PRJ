A mixture is a combination of two or more substances that are not chemically bonded together and can be separated by physical means. \n\nOption (A), light, is not a mixture. Light is a form of energy and does not consist of different substances. \n\nOption (B), a molecule, is also not a mixture. A molecule refers to the smallest unit of a chemical compound and is made up of atoms bonded together. \n\nOption (D), gold, is also not a mixture. Gold is a pure element and consists of only one type of atom. \n\nOption (C), terra cotta, is the correct answer. Terra cotta is a type of clay composed of a mixture of different minerals like clay, quartz, and feldspar. These substances are physically combined but not chemically bonded together, making it an example of a mixture."
