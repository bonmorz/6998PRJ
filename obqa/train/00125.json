As they move from flower to flower, they unintentionally take pollen with them, which can then be transferred to other flowers and aid in the pollination process. Option (A) is incorrect because bees and hummingbirds are distinct creatures and do not typically travel together. Option (B) is too general and does not specifically address the behavior of hummingbirds. Option (D) is incorrect because hummingbirds do not produce honey; that is done by bees."
