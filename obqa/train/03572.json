Sharks typically avoid eating fish that they have a symbiotic relationship with. Symbiotic relationships are partnerships between different species where both species benefit. In the case of sharks and certain fish, the fish may clean parasites off the shark's body, making it beneficial for the shark to leave them uneaten. Option (B) is incorrect because sharks generally eat their main prey. Option (C) is incorrect because sharks are attracted to blood and would likely be more inclined to eat a fish that is already bleeding. Option (D) is incorrect because taste preference is not a factor in the shark's decision to eat or not eat a particular fish."
