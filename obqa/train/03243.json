Kelp is a type of seaweed that is capable of photosynthesis, which means it can produce its own food. Therefore, it needs provisions or resources to maintain its life. Option (B), dying, is incorrect because kelp, like other living organisms, strives to survive and does not intentionally die. Option (C), hibernation, is incorrect because hibernation is a phenomenon observed in certain animals during the winter months, where their metabolic rate decreases to conserve energy.
