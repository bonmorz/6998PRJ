When the airboat moves from grass to water, it will experience a decrease in friction because the water provides less resistance compared to the grass. As a result, the airboat's speed will increase, causing it to speed up. Option (A) is incorrect because there is no reason for the airboat to blow up.

Airboats are designed with a large propeller or fan that pushes air backwards, creating a forward thrust.

The decrease in friction allows the airboat to move more freely, resulting in an increase in speed. Option (A) is incorrect because there is no indication that the airboat will explode.
