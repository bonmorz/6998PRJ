Incandescent light bulbs work by passing an electric current through a tungsten filament, which causes the filament to become extremely hot and emit visible light. Option (A) is partially correct, as incandescent light bulbs do get very warm, but it does not fully explain how they work. Option (B) is incorrect because filaments do not freeze. Option (D) is incorrect because the filament does not catch fire, rather it becomes hot and glows. Option (C) is the correct answer because the glowing filament is what produces the light in an incandescent light bulb."
