When a thousand new trucks are put on the road carrying produce, it means that there is more transportation of produce happening. As a result, distant locations will have greater options for produce because there are more trucks delivering it to them. Option (A) is incorrect because there is no logical connection between new trucks carrying produce and distant cities burning down. Option (B) is unlikely because an increase in transportation usually leads to some changes. Option (C) is unrelated and does not make sense in the context of the question."
