This is because in order for a tool to be useful, it first needs to be conceptualized and brought into existence by someone through the process of invention. Once a tool has been invented, it can then be used for its intended purpose. Option (A) is incorrect because cleaning a tool is not necessarily a prerequisite for its utility. Option (B) is incorrect because there is a specific condition that needs to happen for utility to occur. Option (C) is incorrect because baptism is a religious ritual and not related to the invention or functionality of a tool."
