An extremely rapid surge of rising flood water at the speed mentioned can indeed be powerful enough to lift a 250-ton object off the ground. This is because the force and pressure of the water can create enough buoyancy to lift heavy objects. Options (A) and (D) are incorrect because a powerful surge of flood water will not keep the land dry, and it will not reach high in the sky. Option (B) is incorrect because while flood waters can cause significant damage, they are generally not strong enough to lift and carry a tall mountain."
