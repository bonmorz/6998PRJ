Bronze (A) is a metal commonly used for sculptures, but it is not a raw material that is commonly used for making toys. Plastic (B) is a commonly used material for making toys as it is easily moldable and can be mass-produced. Denim (C) is a fabric typically used for making clothing and is not typically used as a raw material for making toys. Logs (D), on the other hand, are a type of raw material that can be used to make wooden toys. Logs can be cut, shaped, and carved into various toy designs. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) logs as they can be used as a raw material to make a toy."

Option (A) bronze is a metal that is typically used for sculptures, decorations, or jewelry. While it can be used for toy making, it is not a commonly chosen material due to its weight and cost. \n\nOption (B) plastic is a versatile and widely used material in toy manufacturing. It can be molded into various shapes, is lightweight, and often more affordable compared to other options. Plastic is a common choice for making toys because it is safe, durable, and allows for vibrant colors. \n\nOption (C) denim is a fabric commonly used for making clothing, specifically jeans. While denim might be used for toy accessories or clothing, it is not typically the primary raw material for making a toy. \n\nOption (D) logs are pieces of wood typically derived from trees. Wood is a commonly used material in toy making due to its availability, versatility, and natural aesthetic appeal. Logs can be carved, shaped, and sanded down to create a wide variety of toys. However, using logs as raw materials would require additional processing steps, such as cutting, shaping, and finishing, to transform them into suitable toy components. \n\nBased on these considerations, option (D) logs would be the most appropriate choice for someone who wants to use a raw material to make a toy."
