Seeds contain all the necessary nutrients and energy for a plant to grow. As the bean is in a suitable environment (dirt), it will germinate and sprout into a plant. Option (A) is incorrect because a seed does not shrink in size as it grows. Option (C) is incorrect because there is no burning involved in the germination process.
