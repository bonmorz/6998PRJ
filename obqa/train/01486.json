To reach the sun, a spacecraft would require a significant amount of fuel, as the sun is relatively far from Earth. Additionally, since space travel takes time, the journey would also require a significant amount of time. Option (A) is incorrect because muscle is not relevant to space travel. Option (B) is partially correct since navigation would be necessary, but speed alone would not guarantee reaching the sun. Option (C) is incorrect because while the journey would involve speed, light itself would not be the primary requirement. Option (D) correctly identifies both fuel and time as important factors for a shuttle quest to Earth's light source."
