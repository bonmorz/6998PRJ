A tugboat is a small, powerful boat that is used to assist larger ships in maneuvering in tight spaces or difficult conditions. One of the main ways a tugboat helps a ship is by increasing its speed. By pushing or pulling the ship, the tugboat can provide extra power and help the ship move more quickly through the water. Option (A) is incorrect because watching for sharks is not a primary role of a tugboat. Option (B) is incorrect because loading passengers is not a common task for a tugboat. Option (C) is incorrect because holding an anchor is typically the role of the ship itself, not the tugboat."
