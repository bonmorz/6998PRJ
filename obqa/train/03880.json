When members of a species are born, the population of that species increases. This is because a species refers to a group of organisms that can reproduce and produce fertile offspring. Therefore, as more individuals are born, the population of the species increases. Option (A), water, is unrelated to population growth. Option (C), understanding, is also unrelated to population growth as it refers to a mental capacity. Option (D), food, is also unrelated to population growth as it is not directly connected to the birth of new members in a species."
