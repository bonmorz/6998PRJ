Berries are the fruit produced by certain plants, and their primary purpose is to attract animals to eat them and disperse the seeds through their droppings. This allows the plant to reproduce and spread. Option (B), food for animals, is not the main reason for the existence of berries, but rather a secondary benefit for the plant. Option (C), growth, is too general and does not specifically address the purpose of berries. Option (D), food storage, is not applicable to the purpose of berries, as they are primarily for reproduction."
