Option (C), a tea candle, is made of wax and is designed to be burned. Option (A), an electric kettle, does not involve the use of any burning materials. Option (B), an internal combustion engine, relies on the combustion of fuel but does not specifically involve burning wax. Option (D), a gas stove, uses a different type of fuel (gas) for combustion and does not involve burning wax. Therefore, the correct answer is option (C), a tea candle."
