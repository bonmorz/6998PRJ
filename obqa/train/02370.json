If blue whales have trouble finding mates, their population could drop to very low levels. Option (A) is incorrect because if there are fewer mating partners available, it would not result in overpopulation. Option (C) is unrealistic because blue whales cannot become sharks. Option (D) is unlikely because blue whales and killer whales are different species and do not typically mate with each other. Option (B) is the most logical and likely answer, as a low mating population could lead to a significant drop in the overall blue whale population."
