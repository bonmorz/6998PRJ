Option (A) is a clear example of an instinctive behavior because zebras have a natural instinct to migrate towards areas with rainfall at the end of the dry season for access to water and food. Option (B) is not an example of instinctive behavior because falling from its nest is not an innate behavior but rather a result of an accident or mistake. Option (C) is not an example of instinctive behavior because a horse following commands requires training and learning from its rider. Option (D) is not an example of instinctive behavior because birds dying from infection is a result of internal factors and not an innate response to external stimuli."

Instinctive behavior refers to behavior that is innate and does not require learning or conscious decision-making.

Option (C) describes a horse following the commands of its rider, which is learned behavior through training and not instinctive.
