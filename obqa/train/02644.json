The stars in the sky appear to vary from month to month because the Earth is constantly rotating on its axis and orbiting around the Sun. As a result, our perspective of the night sky changes, and different stars become visible at different times of the year. This phenomenon, known as the apparent motion of the stars, is expected and can be explained by the Earth's axial tilt. Option (A) is incorrect because the changing positions of stars in the sky is not a new phenomenon. Option (C) is subjective and not related to the scientific explanation. Option (D) is misleading, as the varying positions of stars in the sky is actually common and not rare or unusual."
