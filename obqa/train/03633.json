Next, we need to eliminate the options that do not make sense in the given context. Option (C), sharks, can be eliminated because they are marine animals and not found in neighborhoods. Option (D), bees, can also be eliminated because while bees do collect pollen, they do not typically move acorns around. \n\nNow we need to decide between the remaining options, snakes and ferrets. Snakes are more commonly associated with prey such as rodents or birds, rather than acorns. Ferrets, on the other hand, are known to be mischievous and playful animals that can move objects around. Therefore, the most reasonable culprit for moving acorns around a neighborhood would be ferrets."
