Gravity lessens as we move away from a planet because the gravitational force exerted by the planet is stronger closer to it and weaker farther away. Option (A) is incorrect because a black hole is an extremely massive object with a strong gravitational pull, so gravity would be stronger near it. Option (C) is incorrect because gravity actually increases as we get closer to a planet.
