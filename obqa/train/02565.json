Moles are underground creatures and spend a significant amount of time burrowing in the soil. Due to their underground lifestyle, they are unlikely to be killed by other animals since there are not many animals that live beneath the surface. Option (A) is incorrect because being underground does not necessarily make moles dirty. Option (C) is redundant because it states the obvious that moles are in dirt. Option (D) is not necessarily true as moles may not always be near worms, although they do feed on them."
