Option (C) is correct because a large gust of wind can pick up sand particles and carry them back to the beach, especially if the person's doorstep is not too far from the beach. Option (A) is incorrect because there are no magic creatures that can move sand. Option (B) is unrelated to the scenario and not relevant to how the sand could end up back on the beach.

Option (A) is incorrect because there is no mention of magic creatures in the scenario. Option (B) is unrelated to the situation, as going to the zoo has no impact on the sand returning to the beach.
