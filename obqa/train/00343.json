Option (B) is the correct answer because a smooth river stone is a result of weathering. Over time, the flowing water in a river will wear down the edges and surface of a stone, making it smooth. Option (A) is incorrect because a smooth sandy beach is not an example of weathering, but rather the result of erosion and deposition. Option (C) is unrelated to weathering as it refers to a tree.
