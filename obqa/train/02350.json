Bears are known to avoid human activity and generally try to stay away from areas where humans are present. Therefore, a person wanting to find a live bear in a forest will have difficulty because bears naturally avoid humanity. Option (B) is incorrect because bears are not domesticated animals. Option (C) is incorrect because while some bears may appear friendly in certain situations, they are still wild animals with unpredictable behavior. Option (D) is incorrect because while bears can have camouflage fur, it is not the primary reason why it is difficult to find them in a forest."
