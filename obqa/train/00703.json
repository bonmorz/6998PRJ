When something moves faster than before, it means that an external force has been applied to it. Option (B) is correct because the application of force can increase the speed of an object. Option (A), the application of water, is incorrect because water is unlikely to directly affect the speed of an object. Option (C), the application of light, is also incorrect because light does not directly cause an object to move faster.
