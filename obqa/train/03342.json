If predators decrease in numbers, then the prey species would have a better chance of survival. \n\nOption (A) suggests that hamsters would have a better chance of survival if predators decreased. This could be because hamsters are small and vulnerable to predators, so a decrease in predators would reduce the risk to their survival. \n\nOption (B) suggests that snakes would also have a better chance of survival. However, this might not be the case because snakes are skilled predators themselves and often rely on other animals as their prey. A decrease in predators might not have a significant impact on their survival.\n\nOption (C) suggests that killer whales would have a better chance of survival if predators decreased. This is unlikely because killer whales are apex predators and are generally not preyed upon by other animals. A decrease in predators would not have a substantial effect on their survival.\n\nOption (D) suggests that tigers would also have a better chance of survival. Tigers are top predators and play a crucial role in maintaining balance within ecosystems. While a decrease in predators might temporarily benefit tiger populations, it could lead to imbalances in the ecosystem and potentially impact their long-term survival.\n\nBased on these considerations, option (A) hamsters would have the best chance of survival if predators decreased."

When predators decrease, it means that there are fewer animals hunting and preying on other animals. In this scenario, hamsters would have a better chance of survival. \n\nThe reason for this is because hamsters are small, herbivorous rodents that are often preyed upon by larger animals such as snakes, killer whales, and tigers. With a decrease in predators, the risk and frequency of hamsters being hunted and killed would be reduced, leading to a better chance of survival for hamsters compared to the other options.\n\nSnakes, killer whales, and tigers are all predators themselves and rely on hunting and preying on other animals for their survival. While a decrease in predators may provide some benefit to them by reducing competition for food, it does not significantly improve their chances of survival compared to hamsters, as they primarily rely on consuming other animals for sustenance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to this question is (A) Hamsters, as they would have a better chance of survival if predators decreased."

Predators play a crucial role in shaping ecosystems by controlling the populations of their prey species. \n\nOption (A) states that hamsters would have a better chance of survival if predators decreased. This answer is correct because hamsters are small, prey animals that are often targeted by predators. With fewer predators, hamsters would face less risk of predation and therefore have a better chance of survival.\n\nOption (B) states that snakes would have a better chance of survival if predators decreased. While it is true that snakes are predators themselves, they are also prey for larger predators like birds of prey or other snakes. So, a decrease in predators could potentially benefit snakes, but it's not as certain as with hamsters.\n\nOption (C) states that killer whales would have a better chance of survival if predators decreased. This answer is incorrect because killer whales, as apex predators, have no natural predators in their ecosystem. Their survival is not significantly influenced by changes in predator populations.\n\nOption (D) states that tigers would have a better chance of survival if predators decreased. This answer is incorrect because tigers are large predators themselves and are not highly dependent on other predators for their survival. Their main threats come from poaching and habitat loss, rather than from other predators.\n\nIn summary, hamsters (option A) would have a better chance of survival if predators decreased because they are small prey animals at a higher risk of predation."
