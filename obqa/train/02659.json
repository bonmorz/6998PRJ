The correct answer is (C) perusing. \"Perusing\" means to examine or read something in a careful and detailed way. In this context, if a thing is going to consume something that moves, it would need to carefully examine or track its movements. \n\nOption (A) nursing does not fit the context because nursing refers to the act of feeding a baby or young animal with milk from the mother's breast. Option (B) birthing is incorrect because it refers to the process of giving birth to offspring, not consuming something. Option (D) grazing is also incorrect because grazing typically refers to animals feeding on grass or plants, not consuming something that moves."
