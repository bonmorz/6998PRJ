They have adapted to obtain nutrients from insects, but their ability to absorb sunlight is not specifically related to that adaptation. \n\nOption (C) is incorrect because plants that grow in the tundra, such as mosses and lichens, are adapted to survive in cold and harsh environments. They may not have as much access to sunlight compared to plants in more temperate regions. \n\nOption (D) is incorrect because ladybugs are attracted to certain plants due to the presence of aphids or other insects, not because those plants have a higher capacity to absorb sunlight. The preference of ladybugs does not determine the amount of sunlight a plant can absorb."
