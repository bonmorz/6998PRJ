Option (A) may be true in some cases, as colder air can still occur in the transition period, but it is not the main change that occurs. Option (B) is incorrect because the ground usually starts to thaw and become less frozen during this transition. Option (C) may be true if there are extreme weather conditions, but it is not the general trend.
