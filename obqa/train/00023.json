Legs are used for locomotion and are a common characteristic among animals that give birth to live young. Option (A) is incorrect because gills are typically found in animals that live in water and undergo external fertilization, such as fish. Option (B) is incorrect because scales are commonly found in reptiles, which lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young. Option (C) is incorrect because exoskeletons are found in invertebrates, such as insects and crustaceans, which also lay eggs."
