Option (A) is Mars, which is much further away from Earth compared to the other options. Option (C) is the Milky Way, which is not a celestial object but rather a galaxy that Earth is a part of, so it is not a valid choice. Option (D) is Venus, which is further away from Earth compared to the correct answer.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) Moon. The Moon is the closest celestial object to Earth. It has an average distance of about 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) from Earth. This makes it the shortest distance from Earth when compared to the other options."
