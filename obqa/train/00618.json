Reptiles are ectothermic, which means they rely on their environment to regulate their body temperature. Option (A) is correct because a reptile's body temperature will sync with their climate. If the climate is warm, their body temperature will increase, and if the climate is cool, their body temperature will decrease. Option (B) is incorrect because reptiles do not have the ability to maintain a stable body temperature under any circumstances.
