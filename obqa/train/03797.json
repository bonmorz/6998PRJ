Granite is a very hard and durable material, so it cannot be easily damaged. Feathers or a couple of ice cubes would not be strong enough to break or damage granite. Option (D) is not possible as inanimate objects such as granite cannot have feelings. However, a powerful force such as a volcano eruption could completely destroy the granite.
