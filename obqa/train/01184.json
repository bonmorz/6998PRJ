Acid rain is a form of precipitation with high levels of acidity, which can cause damage to buildings, vehicles, and harm to plants and animals. Therefore, it is important to protect any vehicles, such as cars, by moving them to a garage, where they can be shielded from the acid rain. Option (A) is incorrect because going for a quick run would expose you to the acid rain and potentially harm you. Option (C) is also incorrect because dancing in the acid rain would expose you to its harmful effects. Option (D) is incorrect because going for a bike ride would have the same harmful effects as running in the acid rain."
