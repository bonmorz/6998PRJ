Sharks live in water that is deluged with sodium chloride, or salt, because it allows them to have increased buoyancy. The salt in the water helps the sharks to stay afloat and swim without expending too much energy.

Option (C) is incorrect because sharks do not primarily eat people and their ability to do so is not directly related to the salt content in water.
