Option (D) is the correct answer because a child needs energy from food to grow. Without sufficient energy intake, a child's body will not have the resources needed for growth. Option (A) is incorrect because a bed does not directly contribute to physical growth. Option (B) is important for cognitive and intellectual development but not necessarily for physical growth. Option (C) is also important for motivation and personal development but not specifically for physical growth."
