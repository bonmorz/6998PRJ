Option (A) is the correct answer because efficient farming techniques have allowed for increased food production, which has helped support a larger population. Option (B) is partially correct, as more cities can attract people and contribute to population growth, but it is not the primary cause. Option (C) is incorrect because computers have not directly caused an increase in population.

Option (A) states that efficient farming is responsible for the increase in population.

This, in turn, has allowed populations to grow. Options (B) and (C) are incorrect because while they may have contributed to urbanization and technological advancements, they are not direct causes of population growth. Option (D) is also incorrect because global warming refers to the increase in the Earth's average temperature and its effects on the environment, but it is not directly related to population growth."
