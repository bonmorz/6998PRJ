Products that come from the ground are typically natural and organic, such as fruits and vegetables. Option (A) is incorrect because Styrofoam containers are man-made and not derived from the ground. Option (C) is incorrect because wax candles are made from animal or plant-based waxes, not directly from the ground. Option (D) is incorrect because storm clouds are formed in the atmosphere, not on the ground. Option (B) is the correct answer because organic bananas are grown from plants that are rooted in the ground."

Styrofoam containers are made from petroleum, not from materials found in the ground, so option (A) is incorrect. Wax candles are typically made from animal fats or petroleum, not from materials found in the ground, so option (C) is also incorrect. Storm clouds are formed by the condensation of water vapor in the atmosphere and do not come from the ground, so option (D) is incorrect as well. However, organic bananas are a type of fruit that grows on trees, which are rooted in the ground. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer as it represents a product that comes from the ground."
