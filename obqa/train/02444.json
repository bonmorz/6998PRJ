The moon is not a source of light with powerful nuclear reactions, so option (A) is incorrect. The sun, however, is a source of light with powerful nuclear reactions. It generates energy through nuclear fusion, in which hydrogen atoms combine to form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the process. Option (B) is incorrect because the sun is not a source of evil. Option (C) is also incorrect because the sun's reactions are actually very high in temperature and power."
