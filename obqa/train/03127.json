When a local forest is cut down, it can have a significant impact on the habitat of animals that live in that forest. Option (A) is incorrect because a student living in a townhouse is not directly affected by the forest being cut down. Option (B) is also incorrect because a man living in the city is not directly affected by the forest being cut down. Option (C) is incorrect because a dog living in a pound is not directly affected by the forest being cut down. Option (D) is correct because rabbits often live in burrows or holes in the ground within forested areas, and if their habitat is destroyed, they would be greatly affected."
