Transpiration is the process by which water vapor is released from the leaves of a plant. It involves the movement of water (H2O) through the plant's system, including the roots, stem, and leaves. Option (B) is incorrect because pollen is involved in the process of pollination, not transpiration. Option (C) is incorrect because transpiration does not directly involve the production of new oxygen molecules. Option (D) is incorrect because transpiration is not directly related to the production of new seedlings."
