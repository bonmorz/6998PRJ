When there is heavy rainfall, the excess water can cause flooding, which can ruin crops. Option (A) is true because the fields get soaked due to the excessive rainfall. Option (B) is incorrect because flooding can occur due to the overflow of natural bodies of water and does not involve the creation of dams. Option (C) may seem plausible, but it is not a direct effect of flooding. Flooding can disrupt the natural habitats of fish and may lead to indirect effects on their feeding, but it is not a direct result of flooding. Option (D) is the correct answer because flooding can damage or destroy crops, leading to significant losses for farmers."
