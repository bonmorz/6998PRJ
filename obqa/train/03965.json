Wide, smooth leaves are more efficient at absorbing sunlight compared to curled leaves, tiny leaves, or thin, short leaves.

Curled leaves, tiny leaves, and thin, short leaves have smaller surface areas and are less effective in absorbing sunlight."

Option (B) states that a tree with wide, smooth leaves will absorb more sunlight. This is because wide leaves have a larger surface area, which allows them to capture more sunlight. The smooth texture of the leaves also helps to maximize sunlight absorption, as there are no obstructions or rough surfaces that could cause light to be reflected. \n\nIn contrast, the other options are less efficient at absorbing sunlight. A plant with curled leaves (option A) may have a smaller surface area exposed to sunlight, and the curled shape could also block some light from reaching the leaf surface. A rose with tiny leaves (option C) would have a smaller surface area as well, limiting its sunlight absorption. A berry bush with thin, short leaves (option D) would also have a reduced surface area, and the thinness of the leaves may allow more light to pass through rather than being absorbed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) a tree with wide, smooth leaves, as it has the greatest capacity for absorbing sunlight."
