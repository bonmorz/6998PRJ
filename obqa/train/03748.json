Option (C) is about being given a meal, which again is not inherently harmful. Option (D) is about being set on fire, which is definitely harmful and dangerous.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can see that if something avoids all harm for its entire life, it is most likely to avoid ever experiencing being set on fire.
