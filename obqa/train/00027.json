When there are strong winds hitting the windshield of a car, it creates air resistance or drag. This can make it more difficult for the car to reach higher speeds because the wind is pushing against the car, counteracting the forward motion. Option (A) is incorrect because it suggests the car flipping over, which is not a likely scenario due to wind alone. Option (B) is incorrect because the strong winds would actually resist the car's forward motion, making it harder for the car to go faster. Option (D) is incorrect because while the wind may exert sideways force on the car, it is not the primary effect of the wind in this scenario.
