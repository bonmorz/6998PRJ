The coal industry is most likely to effect an ecosystem because the extraction and burning of coal can lead to air and water pollution, habitat destruction, and the release of greenhouse gases. Option (A) is incorrect because while the food industry can have some impact on ecosystems through agricultural practices, it may not have as widespread and detrimental of an effect as the coal industry. Option (C) is incorrect because the solar industry typically has less negative impact on ecosystems compared to coal. Option (D) is incorrect because the retail industry, while it may have some indirect effects on ecosystems through consumption patterns, is less likely to directly impact ecosystems compared to coal."
