When warm winds blow across an area from off of the sea, it indicates that there is a high probability of storms being imminent. Warm winds from the sea often carry moisture and can lead to the formation of storm systems. Option (A) is incorrect because the presence or absence of snow would depend on other factors such as temperature. Option (B) is unrelated and assumes that beaches are always littered. Option (D) is also not necessarily true as warm winds can still carry moisture and result in cloud formation."
