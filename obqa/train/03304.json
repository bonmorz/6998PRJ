When a wall wart (or a power adapter) is not in use, it is not actively generating or dissipating heat. Therefore, if you touch a wall wart that has been off for weeks, it will feel cold because it has reached equilibrium with the temperature of its surroundings. Option (A) is incorrect because it implies that the wall wart will feel very warm, which is not true in this scenario. Option (C) is incorrect because it implies that the wall wart will feel hot, which is also not true in this scenario.

A wall wart is a colloquial term for a power adapter or a plug-in transformer that converts high-voltage power from an outlet to a lower-voltage power suitable for electronic devices.\n\nIn this scenario, if the wall wart hasn't been on in weeks, it should feel cold when touched. This is because the wall wart is not currently plugged into an electrical outlet, and therefore it is not actively converting and delivering power. When the wall wart is not in use, it does not generate any heat. Thus, it remains at room temperature and would feel cold to the touch.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because there is no power flowing through the wall wart to generate heat. Option (C) is incorrect because hot is different from warm and implies a higher temperature. Option (D) is incorrect because the wall wart is not generating any warmth at all. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer as it accurately describes the sensation of touching a wall wart that hasn't been on in weeks."
