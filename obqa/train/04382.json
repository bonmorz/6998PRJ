Option (A) is incorrect because glaciers cooling down would not have a direct impact on ocean space. Option (C) is also incorrect because land space increasing would not directly affect ocean space. Option (D) is incorrect because land shrinking over time due to cold does not align with geological processes. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) glaciers getting much hotter.
