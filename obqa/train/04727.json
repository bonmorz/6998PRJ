If a species is struggling to reproduce, this can contribute to their decline in population size and increase their risk of extinction. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.

Option (C) is not true as there are many factors that can contribute to a species' decline. Option (D) is not the main reason for a species becoming endangered or going extinct, as natural death rates can be balanced by natural birth rates in a healthy population."
