The bees collect the nectar and then break it down into simple sugars through enzymes in their bodies. Option (A) is incorrect because neither maple syrup nor corn syrup are used in the production of honey. Option (B) is incorrect because honey is produced by bees in their hives, not in factories.

Bees collect the nectar and store it in their honey stomachs. In their bodies, enzymes convert the nectar into honey. Then, the bees regurgitate the honey into honeycomb cells and fan it to evaporate excess water, resulting in the thick, sweet substance we know as honey. Therefore, the correct answer is (D), liquid from plant flowers. Option (A) is incorrect because maple syrup or corn syrup are not involved in the natural production of honey. Option (B) is incorrect because honey is typically produced by bees in their hives. Option (C) is incorrect because pesticides are harmful to bees and their ability to produce honey."
