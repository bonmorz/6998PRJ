When a person tells another person which direction to go in order to safely reach land, they are \"navigating.\" Navigating means to plan and direct the route or course of a ship, aircraft, or other form of transportation. Option (A) best describes the act of giving directions and guiding someone towards their destination. Option (B) means to deny or nullify, which is not applicable in this context. Option (C) means to depend on or trust in someone or something, which is not related to giving directions. Option (D) means to cause destruction, which is also not related to giving directions.
