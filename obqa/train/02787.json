When we chew and swallow a steak, it goes through a process called mechanical digestion, where it is broken down into smaller pieces. This makes it easier for the enzymes in our stomach to further break down the food through chemical digestion. Option (A) is incorrect because chewing and swallowing a steak does not serve it hot. Option (C) is incorrect because there is no energy loss in the process of chewing and swallowing. Option (D) is unrelated to the process and not a valid outcome of chewing and swallowing."
