Bees are attracted to flowers because of the nectar they produce, which is a sugar-rich liquid. Bees collect nectar as a source of food for themselves and their hive. Option (B) is incorrect because bees are not attracted to the scent of flower stamens, but rather to the nectar produced by the flowers. Option (C) is incorrect because plants produce oxygen through photosynthesis, not a liquid. Option (D) is incorrect because flowers do not give off a magnetic field."
