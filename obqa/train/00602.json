A phase change occurs when a substance changes from one state of matter to another, such as from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas. Option (A) is incorrect because the chopping of onions does not involve a change in the state of matter. Option (C) is incorrect because the addition of water to a glass does not involve a change in the state of matter either. Option (D) is also incorrect because the blooming of flowers does not involve a change in the state of matter. Option (B) is correct because when food is digested by the stomach, it undergoes a chemical change and is broken down into simpler substances, which can be considered a phase change."
