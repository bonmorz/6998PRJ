Prey animals, such as mice, are more likely to be within the hunting capabilities of a hawk compared to larger animals like lions or rhinos. Option (B) is incorrect because hawks primarily hunt small animals, not nuts and berries. Option (C) and (D) are incorrect because hawks would not typically try to touch or attack larger predator animals like lions or rhinos."
