The tongue is considered the speediest healer because it has a rich blood supply, saliva that helps keep the area clean, and a high number of bacteria-fighting properties. This allows cuts or wounds on the tongue to heal relatively quickly compared to other parts of the body. Options (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect as they do not possess the same healing properties as the tongue."

In order to answer this question, we need some basic understanding of the healing process in the human body. Among the given options, the skin heals the fastest. When there is a cut or injury to the skin, the body's natural healing process involves the recruitment of cells to the site of injury, such as white blood cells and platelets, to create a clot and begin the repair process. The skin cells then rapidly divide and migrate to close the wound, forming new tissue. This process is known as wound healing, and the skin is capable of healing relatively quickly. \n\nOption (B) - tongue, is incorrect. The tongue is not known for its healing capabilities and does not heal faster than the skin. Option (C) - toes, is also incorrect. While toes can heal from injuries, they do not heal faster than the skin. Option (D) - heart, is incorrect. The heart is a vital organ, but it does not have the same regenerative abilities as the skin."
