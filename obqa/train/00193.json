When a lake is exposed to enough heat over time, it can evaporate completely and cease to exist. Option (A) is incorrect because animals may leave the lake if conditions are unfavorable, but it is not a direct result of the heat. Option (C) is partially correct as plants may dry up in a heated lake, but this does not happen to the point of completely drying up the lake. Option (D) is incorrect because fish may be affected by the heat, but it does not necessarily result in them growing ill."
