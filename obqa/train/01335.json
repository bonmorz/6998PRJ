The Earth is composed of multiple layers, including the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. The crust is made up of rocks and minerals, which can be considered as stone. Therefore, if the Earth were small enough to put on a plate and serve up for dinner, the being eating it would get mouthfuls of stone. The other options, such as stew, towels, and corn, are unrelated to the composition of the Earth."
