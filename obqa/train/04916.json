The ears collect sound waves and transmit them to the auditory system in the brain, where they are processed and perceived. Option (B) is incorrect because the brain processes the sound, but it is not the location where sound is initially heard. Option (C) is incorrect because the eyes are responsible for vision, not hearing. Option (D) is incorrect because the neck is not directly involved in the process of hearing."
