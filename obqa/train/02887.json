Instinctive behaviors are innate behaviors that are performed without any prior learning or conscious thought. Option (A), doing a cartwheel outside, is a voluntary action and not an instinctive behavior. Option (B), singing on a stage, is a learned behavior and not an instinctive behavior. Option (C), eating a large pizza, is a voluntary action triggered by hunger, not an instinctive behavior. Option (D), a mother feeding the kids, is an example of an instinctive behavior seen in many animal species, including humans. It is a natural and automatic response for mothers to provide food for their offspring."

Instinctive behaviors are automatic and innate actions that do not need to be learned or taught. Option (D), a mother feeding her children, is an example of instinctive behavior because it is a natural and unlearned behavior that mothers often display to provide nourishment for their offspring. Option (A), doing a cartwheel outside, and option (B), singing on a stage, are both actions that typically require some level of learning or training. Option (C), eating a large pizza, is a behavior that is influenced more by personal preference and cultural factors rather than being instinctual."

Option (C) eating a large pizza is not an instinctive behavior because food preferences and eating habits are influenced by culture and learned behaviors. Option (D) a mother feeding the kids, however, is an example of an instinctive behavior.
