The term \"new\" suggests something that occurs or happens regularly at specific intervals. In this case, we are looking for a term that occurs once every 3 months.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because cities do not occur or change regularly at specific intervals. Option (C) is also incorrect because hills are not something that forms or changes regularly. Option (D) is incorrect as well because waves occur more frequently than once every 3 months.\n\nOption (B), climatic term, is the correct answer. \"Climatic term\" refers to a specific term used to describe a particular climate pattern or condition that occurs once every 3 months. For example, the term \"monsoon\" is a climatic term that describes a season of heavy rainfall occurring once every 3 months in certain regions."
