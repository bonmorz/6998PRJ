Bees are key to a flower's procreation because they play a crucial role in the transfer of pollen from the male part of the flower (the stamen) to the female part (the pistil). This process allows for fertilization and the production of seeds, which are necessary for the reproduction of flowers.

Bees are key to a flower's procreation because they are the main pollinators. Bees transfer pollen from the male part of one flower to the female part of another flower, which leads to fertilization and the production of seeds. The other options are not related to the role of bees in pollination. Option (B) is incorrect because bees do not play a role in a flower's water supply.
