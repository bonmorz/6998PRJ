At noon, the sun is at its highest point in the sky, which means it is directly overhead. This positioning allows for the most direct and intense sunlight to reach the Earth's surface, leading to higher temperatures. In contrast, at midnight, the sun is on the opposite side of the Earth, so there is no direct sunlight reaching the person outside. Morning and evening times can vary in terms of temperature, but they generally receive less direct sunlight compared to noon. Therefore, the person would feel the most heat outside at noon."

At noon, the sun is at its highest point in the sky, and its rays are most direct. This means that the person would receive the maximum amount of solar radiation and therefore feel the most heat. Option (B) is incorrect because at midnight, the sun is on the other side of the Earth, and it is nighttime. Option (C) is incorrect because in the morning, the sun is still low on the horizon and has not yet gained enough altitude to provide significant heat. Option (D) is also incorrect because in the evening, the sun is setting and its rays are less direct, resulting in less heat."
