Nonliving things, on the other hand, do not exhibit these characteristics. \n\nIn this question, options (A) and (D) involve parts or actions of living organisms. A hair on your head is still attached to a living organism (you) and is therefore considered living. Similarly, a human jogging down a track is a living organism engaging in a physical activity.\n\nOption (B) mentions a rabbit, which is a living organism. Rabbits are able to hop along, reproduce, and respond to their surroundings. \n\nOption (C) states a fallen palm leaf. Leaves are detached from the plant and no longer connected to the plant's metabolic processes. They do not possess the ability to grow, reproduce, or respond to stimuli. Therefore, a fallen palm leaf would be considered nonliving. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) a fallen palm leaf."

Therefore, this option is incorrect as it is still a part of a living organism.\n\nOption (B) states \"a rabbit hopping along.\" A rabbit is a living organism because it exhibits all the characteristics of living things mentioned earlier. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption (C) states \"a fallen palm leaf.\" A fallen palm leaf has died and is no longer part of a living plant.
