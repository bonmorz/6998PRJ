Option (B) is the correct answer because a mini flashlight usually contains a small light bulb that emits heat when turned on. Option (A) is incorrect because an ice cube does not generate heat, rather it absorbs heat from its surroundings. Option (C) is incorrect because snow is at a lower temperature and is used to cool things down, not generate heat. Option (D) is incorrect because although glaciers are formed from compacted snow and ice, they are not a source of heat."
