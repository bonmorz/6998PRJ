The moon orbits the Earth, not a star, so option (D) is incorrect. A galaxy is a collection of stars and other celestial objects, so it does not orbit a single star, making option (B) incorrect. Neptune, on the other hand, is a planet in our solar system that orbits around the sun, which is a star. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer."
