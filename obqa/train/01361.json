As the Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of the Earth receive varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year, leading to changes in temperature and the seasons. Option (C) is the correct answer because the local star refers to the Sun, which is responsible for providing the sunlight that causes the seasons. Options (A) and (B) are incorrect because Mars and Saturn are not the cause of seasons on Earth. Option (D) is incorrect because while sunlight is associated with the seasons, it is specifically the sunlight from the Sun that causes the changes, not sunlight in general from any source."
