If a school cafeteria left their waste uncollected for a while, it might attract raccoons. Raccoons are known scavengers and are opportunistic feeders that are often attracted to garbage and food waste. Option (A) is incorrect because bats typically feed on insects or fruit and are not commonly attracted to waste. Option (C) is unlikely because eagles are predators and do not typically scavenge for food waste. Option (D) is not a likely scenario because people typically do not scavenge food waste in the same way that animals do."

If a school cafeteria leaves their waste uncollected for a while, it is likely to attract raccoons. Raccoons are opportunistic eaters and are known to scavenge for food in garbage bins and other areas where food is easily accessible. Option (A) is possible, as bats are known to eat insects and may be attracted to an area with a large amount of garbage, but it is less likely than raccoons. Option (C), attracting eagles, is highly unlikely as eagles are carnivorous birds and typically feed on live prey rather than scavenging. Option (D), attracting people, may happen to some extent if the waste is not cleaned up for a significant amount of time, but it is not the most likely outcome in this scenario."
