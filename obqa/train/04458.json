The Dust Bowl was a period of severe dust storms and drought that occurred in the Great Plains region of the United States during the 1930s. The primary cause of the Dust Bowl was unsustainable farming practices. Farmers in the region were using intensive plowing techniques that removed the natural grasses that held the soil in place and prevented erosion. This led to widespread soil erosion and the creation of huge dust storms. Option (A) is unrelated to the cause of the Dust Bowl. Option (B) is unrelated and just a play on words. Option (C) is incorrect because sweeping reform is not a direct cause of the Dust Bowl."

The Dust Bowl was a period of severe dust storms that occurred during the 1930s in the United States, primarily in the Great Plains region.

Farmers in the Great Plains had been practicing intensive farming, which involved plowing the land extensively without implementing proper soil conservation methods.
