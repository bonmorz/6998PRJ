Voles are small, burrowing rodents that are known to live under rocks or in underground tunnels. They prefer habitats with dense vegetation and are often found in areas with plenty of cover, such as under rocks or logs. Eagles, cats, and dogs are unlikely to live under rocks as they have different habitat preferences and behaviors. Cats and dogs are typically domesticated pets that live with humans, while eagles are large birds of prey that build nests in trees or on cliffs."

Voles are small mammals that often burrow and live in underground tunnels or in areas with dense vegetation.

Eagles are birds of prey that typically build nests in high places such as trees or cliffs, making them unlikely to live under a rock. Cats and dogs are domesticated animals that generally live in human homes or in outdoor environments with shelter, making them less likely to live under a rock compared to the natural habitat of a vole.
