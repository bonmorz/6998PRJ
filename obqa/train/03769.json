When a stone is tossed into a creek and sinks, it will generally move with the flow of the water, in this case to the west. On the other hand, a leaf is lighter and has some buoyancy, which allows it to stay on the surface of the water rather than sink. Therefore, the leaf will also move with the flow of the water to the west. Option (B) is incorrect because there is no mention of any burning or heat involved. Option (C) is incorrect because the stone sinks and does not float up. Option (D) is incorrect because the leaf will move in the same direction as the water, not north."
