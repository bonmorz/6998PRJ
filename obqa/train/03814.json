Basic knowledge of how water flows and interacts with different elevations is needed to answer this question correctly. When an area experiences flooding, the water tends to flow downhill and accumulate in lower elevation locations. As a result, places of lower elevation are more affected by the flood. Option (A) is incorrect because a lower place is more prone to flooding due to the natural flow of water. Option (B) is incorrect because the lower area may not be flooded before the flood event. Option (D) is incorrect because lower elevation locations can indeed be flooded."

Generally, a place of lower elevation is more affected by flooding compared to a higher location. This is because gravity causes water to flow downhill, so when a flood occurs, water from higher elevations flows to lower elevations. Therefore, the lower area is more likely to experience flooding, whereas the higher location may be able to avoid or withstand flooding to some extent. Option (A) is incorrect because a lower elevation is not more resistant to flooding. Option (B) is not necessarily true as flooding may not always occur in the lower area. Option (D) is incorrect because lower elevation locations can still experience flooding, as stated in the explanation above."

Basic knowledge about elevation and flooding is required to answer this question correctly. \n\nOption (A), \"It is more resistant than a higher place,\" is incorrect. Generally, places of lower elevation are more prone to flooding because water naturally flows downhill. The higher the elevation, the less likely it is to experience flooding.\n\nOption (B), \"The lower area is already flooded,\" is also incorrect. The question asks how a place of lower elevation is affected by flooding, implying that the flooding has not yet occurred.\n\nOption (C), \"It is more affected by the flood,\" is the correct answer. When flooding occurs, areas of lower elevation are more likely to experience the effects of the flood, such as water submersion and damage to infrastructure and property.\n\nOption (D), \"It is impossible to flood a lower elevation location,\" is incorrect. Flooding can occur in any location, but it is more likely to occur in areas of lower elevation due to the natural flow of water.\n\nTo summarize, option (C) is the correct answer because a place of lower elevation is more affected by flooding compared to a higher location."
