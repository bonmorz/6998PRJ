In order for the boy to have two legs and two arms, his parents would also need to have a total of four limbs. This means that they have the same number of limbs as the boy. Option (B) correctly states that the parents have the same number of limbs. Option (A) is incorrect because it suggests that the parents have nearly an arm and a leg each, which would mean they have more limbs than the boy. Option (C) is incorrect because it suggests that the parents have only their left arms, which would mean they have fewer limbs than the boy. Option (D) is incorrect because it suggests that the parents have one right leg each, which would mean they have more limbs than the boy. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."
