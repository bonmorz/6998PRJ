When a child consumes a lot of sugar, such as from eating a basket of chocolate eggs, they tend to have an increase in energy. This often leads to the child running around all day. Option (A) is incorrect because consuming chocolate eggs would not directly cause the child to sleep in the afternoon. Option (B) is unlikely because the child would likely be too energetic to quietly sit and read a book. Option (D) is also unlikely because consuming more eggs would not necessarily be a direct result of eating the initial eggs."
