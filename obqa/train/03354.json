As the leaves fall off the trees and food becomes less plentiful, animals in the environment may go through changes to adapt to these conditions. Hares growing longer fur is a likely occurrence because the longer fur will provide better insulation to keep them warm in the colder weather. Option (B) is incorrect because worms do not have fur, so they cannot grow longer fur. Option (C) is unrelated because worms do not sing. Option (D) is also unrelated because hares do not sing."
