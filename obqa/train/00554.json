A streak plate is a hard, smooth surface used to determine the color of a mineral when it is scratched against it.

Option (A) is incorrect because it only describes a characteristic of the mineral, not the act of rubbing it on a streak plate. Option (C) is incorrect because rubbing calcium on a streak plate does not provide significant information about calcium itself. Option (D) is incorrect because rubbing calcium on a streak plate does not break it into chunks, as the calcium remains solid during the process."
