To answer this question, we need to recall some basic knowledge about the celestial bodies in our solar system. \n\nOption (D) states that all of the given options exhibit a spinning motion. This is the correct answer. All of the planets in our solar system, including Venus, Earth, and Mars, rotate or spin on their axis. The rotation of the Earth, for example, leads to day and night as different parts of the planet are exposed to sunlight or darkness.\n\nOption (A) states that Venus exhibits a spinning motion. This is true because Venus rotates on its axis just like any other planet.\n\nOption (B) states that the Earth exhibits a spinning motion. This is true, as mentioned earlier, the Earth rotates on its axis, leading to day and night.\n\nOption (C) states that Mars exhibits a spinning motion. This is also true, as Mars rotates on its axis just like other planets.\n\nTherefore, since all the given options are correct in stating that each planet exhibits a spinning motion, option (D) is the correct answer."
