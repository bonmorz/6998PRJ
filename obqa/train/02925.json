The amount of alcohol consumed (how much you drink) and the amount of food consumed (how much you eat) are influenced by personal choices and external factors, rather than being solely determined by genetics. Similarly, an individual's weight (how much you weigh) is influenced by a combination of genetic factors, lifestyle choices, and environmental factors. However, height is primarily determined by genetic factors and tends to be more stable and less changeable compared to factors like drinking habits, eating habits, and weight."
