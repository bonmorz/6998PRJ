During photosynthesis, energy from the sun is used to synthesize energy-rich molecules like glucose. Therefore, the organism needs to synthesize its own energy. Option (A) is incorrect because taking naps is unrelated to energy production. Option (B) is unrelated because swimming fast does not directly relate to energy synthesis. Option (D) is unrelated to energy synthesis as well, as riding bicycles does not produce energy for the organism."
