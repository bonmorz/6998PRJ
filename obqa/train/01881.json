The incident referred to in the question is the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, where an offshore drilling rig operated by the company BP exploded, resulting in a massive release of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, coastal animals were coated in oil, causing significant harm to the marine ecosystem. Option (A) is incorrect because dirt would not cause such an event. Option (B) is incorrect because foam would not cause animals to be coated. Option (C) is incorrect because while natural gas can be a byproduct of offshore drilling, it is not the substance that coated the animals. Only option (D) accurately identifies the substance responsible for the coating, which in this case is oil."
