Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals and take millions of years to be created. Therefore, they are considered a non-renewable resource. Option (A) is incorrect because fossil fuels are not renewable, as they are formed at a much slower rate than they are being consumed. Option (B) is incorrect because fossil fuels have a finite supply that will eventually run out. Option (C) is also incorrect because although fossil fuels can last for a significant amount of time, they will eventually be depleted. Option (D) is the correct answer because fossil fuels are currently being used at a faster rate than they are being formed, leading to a decrease in supply and making them a dwindling commodity."
