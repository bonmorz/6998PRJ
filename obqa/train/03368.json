Molecules are the building blocks of matter, so it is likely that any physical object is made up of molecules. Option (A) is incorrect because empty space refers to the absence of matter and does not contain molecules. Option (C) is subjective and not scientifically testable. Option (D) refers to the absence of anything and does not contain molecules. Only option (B), an osprey (a type of bird), is a physical object that would be made up of molecules."

Molecules are the building blocks of matter, and everything that we can physically touch and interact with is made up of molecules.

Option (C) is a metaphysical concept and not something that can be proven or disproven using scientific methods. Option (D) refers to the absence of anything and thus cannot be made of molecules.
