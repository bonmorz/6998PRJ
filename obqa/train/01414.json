Penguins are birds that are adapted to live in cold environments, specifically in frozen habitats such as the Antarctic region. They have special adaptations, like a thick layer of fat and waterproof feathers, that allow them to thrive in these icy conditions. Therefore, option (C) is incorrect because penguins actually prefer and thrive in frozen habitats. Option (A) is incorrect because the cold pole refers to the polar regions, which is exactly where penguins live. Option (B) is incorrect because while some penguins may live in zoos for conservation purposes, it is not their natural habitat. The correct answer, option (D), is a native forest. Penguins are not adapted to live in land-based habitats like forests, as their bodies are designed for swimming and surviving in icy marine environments."
