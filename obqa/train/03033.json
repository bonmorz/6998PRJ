When a season switches from one to another in a place, it means that the Earth has moved more in its orbit around the sun, causing changes in the amount of sunlight received by different parts of the Earth. Option (A) is incorrect because the Earth exploding is not related to seasonal changes. Option (B) is incorrect because the Earth is constantly moving.

When a season switches from one to another in a place, it means that the Earth has moved more in its orbit around the sun. Earth's orbit is not a perfect circle, it is slightly elliptical, so as it orbits around the sun, its distance from the sun changes slightly. This, along with the tilt of Earth's axis, causes different parts of the Earth to receive varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year, leading to the changing of seasons. Option (A) is incorrect because if the Earth exploded, there would be much more significant consequences than just a change in seasons. Option (B) is incorrect because Earth is constantly moving in its orbit around the sun. Option (D) is incorrect because freezing is not the cause of the changing of seasons."
