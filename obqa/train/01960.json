Option (C) is the correct answer because overhead signs are typically made of reflective material, such as metal or plastic, which allows the light to bounce off and be seen. Options (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect because these materials are not typically reflective and do not easily bounce light. A paper bag absorbs light, a pencil is not a smooth or reflective surface, and a cardboard box also absorbs light."
