Camouflage is a strategy used by organisms to blend in with their surroundings in order to hide from predators or prey. In this case, an organism that looks like the local flora would be an example of camouflage. Option (A) is incorrect because clouds are not typically used as a form of camouflage by organisms. Option (C) is incorrect because buildings are not typically found in nature and therefore would not provide effective camouflage. Option (D) is incorrect because organisms cannot change their appearance to look like oceans."
