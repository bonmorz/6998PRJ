Leaves benefit from the sun because they use sunlight to perform photosynthesis, a process by which they convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose. Option (A) is incorrect because dogs are not directly related to the benefits of leaves. Option (C) is also incorrect because humans are not necessary for the photosynthetic process. Option (D) is incorrect because dust does not provide any benefits to the leaves."
