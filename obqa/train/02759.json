An animal that often lives in holes in the ground in fields is commonly referred to as a burrowing animal. These animals typically have adaptations to suit their lifestyle, such as round ears that allow them to detect predators or prey while underground. Option (A) is unrelated to the characteristics of a burrowing animal. Option (C) is incorrect because animals with wings generally do not live in holes in the ground. Option (D) is unrelated to the characteristics of a burrowing animal."

Animals like rabbits or groundhogs are known to live in burrows or holes in the ground. One common characteristic of these animals is that they typically have round ears, which helps them detect potential predators or other threats. Option (A) is incorrect because having long curly hair is not a defining characteristic of animals that live in holes in the ground. Option (C) is incorrect because having four wings is more commonly associated with insects or birds, not animals that live in burrows. Option (D) is incorrect because rainbow stripes are not a typical characteristic of animals that live in holes in the ground in fields."
