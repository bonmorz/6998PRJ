When an object is torn, its formation or structure is altered. It may break into smaller pieces or have its original shape distorted. Option (B) is incorrect because biology refers to the study of living organisms and is not relevant to non-living objects. Option (C) is partially related because tearing an object can change its chemical composition if it involves breaking chemical bonds, but this option is too broad and does not capture the overall effect of tearing. Option (D) is unrelated because nutrition refers to the process of obtaining and utilizing nutrients by living organisms, which is not applicable to non-living objects."
