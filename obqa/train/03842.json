As they consume the flesh, they break it down and turn it into nutrients that can be absorbed by the soil. This process is an important part of the natural decomposition cycle. Option (A) is incorrect because maggots do not make the flesh dryer. Option (C) is incorrect because maggots are not responsible for making the flesh rancid.
