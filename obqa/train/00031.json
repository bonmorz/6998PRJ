An earth mover is a machine or organism that is capable of moving large amounts of earth or soil. Options (A) cat, (B) dog, and (D) fish are incorrect because they are not typically associated with this capability. Option (C) annelids refers to a group of organisms that includes earthworms, which are known for their ability to burrow through soil and move earth. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer."
