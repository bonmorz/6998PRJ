A windmill is the safest option to breathe around because it does not emit any harmful pollutants. Option (A) is incorrect because a coal plant emits pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, which can be harmful to breathe. Option (B) is also incorrect because Union Carbide is a chemical manufacturing company that could potentially release harmful chemicals into the air. Option (D) is incorrect because automobile emissions contribute to air pollution, including pollutants like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides."

Breathing around this type of industrial plant can be extremely hazardous. \n\n- Option (C), a windmill, does not emit any pollutants or harmful gases. It harnesses wind energy to generate electricity, and the process does not result in any harmful byproducts that would negatively impact air quality. Thus, it is a safer option to breathe around. \n\n- Option (D), an automobile, emits pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter. While advancements in vehicle technology have led to decreased emissions, automobiles still contribute to air pollution in urban areas. \n\nBased on these considerations, option (C) - the windmill, is the safest option to breathe around as it does not emit any harmful pollutants."
