Birds use their beaks for various tasks, such as eating, grooming, building nests, and catching prey.

Option (A) is incorrect because birds use their wings or feet to swim, not their beaks. Option (B) is incorrect because birds do not have legs designed for running. Option (D) is unrelated and does not make sense in the context of a bird's beak."

Option (B) is also incorrect because birds have legs and wings for moving and running, and do not rely on their beaks for locomotion. Option (D) is not accurate because birds do not have the ability to shop as it requires complex human behaviors.
