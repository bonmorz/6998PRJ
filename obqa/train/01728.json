Option C, Cape elephant sengis, is correct because sengis are small insectivorous mammals that visit flowers and inadvertently pick up pollen while feeding on nectar.

Animal pollinators are organisms that help transfer pollen from the male reproductive organs of a flower to the female reproductive organs, enabling fertilization and the production of seeds. Examples of animal pollinators include insects, birds, bats, and small mammals.\n\nOption (A) Dogs are not animal pollinators. While they can interact with plants, they do not typically play a role in pollination.\n\nOption (B) Leaves are not animal pollinators, as they are part of a plant and not a separate organism that can facilitate pollination.\n\nOption (D) Water is not an animal pollinator. While water can play a role in pollination for some plants, it is not considered an animal pollinator.\n\nOption (C) Cape elephant sengis are small mammals found in Africa. While they may not be as well-known as other animal pollinators like bees or butterflies, some species of sengis have been observed to visit flowers and potentially aid in pollination. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer as it represents an example of an animal pollinator."
