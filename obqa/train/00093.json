Thunder clouds, also known as cumulonimbus clouds, are characterized by their significant vertical height and large size. They can extend several miles into the sky and can weigh hundreds of thousands of pounds. Option (A) is incorrect because thunder clouds are not associated with music. Option (C) is incorrect because thunder clouds can appear dark and gray due to the accumulation of water vapor and ice particles. Option (D) is incorrect because thunder clouds can form relatively quickly, typically within an hour or two, depending on the atmospheric conditions."
