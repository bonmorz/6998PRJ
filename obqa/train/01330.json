Moles are able to avoid being detected by hawks, owls, and other predators by traveling beneath the soil. They create intricate tunnels and burrows that allow them to move around without being easily seen or caught. Option (A) is incorrect because moving slowly would not necessarily prevent detection by predators. Option (B) is also incorrect because moles do not have the ability to set traps. Option (D) is incorrect because moles do not build decoys to avoid predators; they rely on their ability to navigate underground."
