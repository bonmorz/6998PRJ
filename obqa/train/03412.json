Wind is a natural force that can easily destroy a sand castle, especially if the wind is strong and persistent. Option (A) is unlikely because cats are not typically known for carrying away sand castles. Option (B) is also unlikely because dogs may knock over a sandcastle while running around, but it is unlikely that it would carry away the whole castle in its mouth. Option (C) is a magical and unlikely explanation, as it is not based on real-world phenomena."
