When a new predator starts eating prey, the prey population will decrease or \"lessen\". This is because the predator is consuming the prey, which leads to a reduction in the number of prey individuals. Option (A) is incorrect because \"heightening\" suggests an increase in prey population, which is the opposite of what would happen in this scenario. Option (C) suggests an increase in the amount of prey, which is also incorrect. Option (D) suggests growth, which could be misleading as it does not specify which population is growing - the predator or the prey.
