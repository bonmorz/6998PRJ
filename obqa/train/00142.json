Precipitation refers to any form of water that falls from the atmosphere, such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. When precipitation occurs, it can lead to the erosion of rocks and soil, which over time can create caves. Option (A) is incorrect because mountains are formed through tectonic activity, not precipitation. Option (B) is incorrect because earthquakes are caused by tectonic activity, not precipitation. Option (C) is incorrect because volcanoes are formed through volcanic activity, not precipitation."
