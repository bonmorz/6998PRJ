Given that the past week has been warm, humid, and foggy, a reasonable assumption is that these conditions are likely to continue.

Option B, clear, is less likely because foggy conditions indicate the presence of moisture in the air, and cooling temperatures would not typically lead to clear skies. Option C, hot, is unlikely because the weather is supposed to cool. Option D, steamy, could also be a possibility due to the humidity, but rain is a more common occurrence when temperatures drop.\n\nIn summary, based on the information provided and basic knowledge of weather patterns, a reasonable assumption is that tomorrow will be rainy."
