In some regions or cultures, houses may be built using branches as a framework, with additional materials added to create walls and a roof. So, option (B) is a possible answer.\n\nOption (C) Styrofoam is not commonly used as a raw material for building houses. While it may be used in some construction applications, it is typically not the primary material for building the entire structure. Thus, option (C) is incorrect.\n\nOption (D) tile is primarily used as a finishing material for floors, walls, and roofs, rather than as the primary material for constructing the entire house.
