When a man moves into a new environment but reproduction ceases to happen, it means that the man is not able to reproduce and contribute to the population growth. As a result, the population of the native species remains stagnant or decreases over time due to the absence of new individuals being added to the population. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because the native species going wild would imply an increase in their population, which contradicts the fact that reproduction has ceased. Option (B) is incorrect because the size of the native species is not necessarily influenced by the absence of reproduction. Option (D) is incorrect because the native species cannot thrive more without reproduction occurring."
