Therefore, option (A) can reproduce.\n\nOak trees reproduce sexually through the production of flowers, pollination, and the formation of seeds. This means that option (B) can reproduce.\n\nBacteria reproduce asexually through binary fission, similar to protozoa. So, option (D) can reproduce.\n\nCats reproduce sexually, with two individuals (male and female) required for reproduction. Option (C) consists of two female cats, which would not be able to produce offspring together. Therefore, option (C) is least likely to reproduce.\n\nOverall, the reproductive capabilities of each option determine that option (C) would be the least likely to reproduce."

Therefore, it is likely that two protozoa would be able to reproduce.\n\n(B) 2 oak trees: Oak trees reproduce through the production of acorns, which contain seeds. If two oak trees are present, they can produce acorns and potentially grow into new oak trees. Therefore, it is also likely that two oak trees would be able to reproduce.\n\n(C) 2 female cats: Unlike protozoa and oak trees, cats reproduce sexually, meaning they require a male and female to mate in order to reproduce. Two female cats would not be able to reproduce without a male cat present. Therefore, it is least likely that two female cats would be able to reproduce.\n\n(D) 2 bacteria: Bacteria reproduce through a process called binary fission, where one bacterium divides into two identical daughter cells. Therefore, it is likely that two bacteria would be able to reproduce.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 2 female cats, as they would need a male cat to reproduce."
