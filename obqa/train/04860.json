When a plane travels, it moves through the layers of gases that make up the Earth's atmosphere. These gases include nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and others. Option (B) is incorrect because planes do not typically fly close to the ground or over flat plains. Option (C) is incorrect because although planes can fly over oceans, they also fly over land.
