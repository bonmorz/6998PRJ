The top layer of soil, also known as the topsoil, is the most nutrient-rich layer. This is because it is where organic matter, such as decomposed plant and animal material, is most abundant, and it is where most plants' roots are located. Option (A) is the correct answer because hiking on the top layer of soil allows you to potentially access these rich nutrients. Options (B), (C), and (D) are not related to soil and do not provide any opportunity for nutrient access."
