Traditional cars emit greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide, when they burn fossil fuels. These emissions contribute to air pollution and increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, causing climate change.\n\nIn contrast, electric cars run on electricity stored in batteries. They do not burn any fossil fuels during operation, leading to zero tailpipe emissions. This significantly reduces air pollution and the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, resulting in more breathable air.\n\nTherefore, option (B) - more breathable air - is the correct answer, as it explains one of the environmental benefits of electric cars compared to traditional cars."
