If something is blown apart and it was living prior to that, it means that it was subjected to some kind of destructive force. In this case, it fell in harm's way because it was destroyed. Option (A) is incorrect because we cannot assume that it only experienced good things before being blown apart. Option (B) is also incorrect because if it was blown apart, it was not perfectly safe. Option (D) is incorrect because being blown apart is not a natural way for something to die."
