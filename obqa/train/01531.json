Balloons (A) have mass and therefore are affected by gravitational force. Stars (B) have mass and are also affected by gravitational force, causing them to have their specific shapes and movements. Air (D) also has mass and is affected by gravitational force, which is why air molecules are pulled towards the Earth's surface. Sunshine (C) is a form of energy emitted by the sun and does not have mass, so it is not affected by gravitational force."

Gravitational force affects all objects, but the effect may be more noticeable or significant on some objects compared to others. Option (C) states that sunshine is not affected by gravitational force. This is true because sunshine refers to the light and heat emitted by the sun, which does not have mass and therefore is not affected by gravity. Options (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect because balloons, stars, and air are all affected by gravitational force. Balloons, although filled with lighter-than-air gases, still experience buoyancy due to gravity. Stars, despite their immense size and distance, are held together and their movements are influenced by gravitational force. Even air, which is a mixture of gases, is affected by gravity and experiences atmospheric pressure as a result."
