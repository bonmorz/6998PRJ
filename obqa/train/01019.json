By repairing the pipes, John can ensure that there are no leaks or damages, thereby reducing water waste and ultimately lowering his water bill. \n\nOptions (A), (B), and (C) are all incorrect because they involve actions that actually waste water. Dripping the sink at night, taking a bath twice a day, and flushing the toilet more all result in increased water usage, which would lead to higher water bills. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer as it focuses on preventing water wastage."
