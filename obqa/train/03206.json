The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the sun, leading to a warming effect. Option (A) is true because the greenhouse effect can cause polar ice melting due to increased temperatures.

Option (D) is true because the greenhouse effect traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to an increase in temperature. Option (B) is false because the greenhouse effect does not cause green air in the sky."
