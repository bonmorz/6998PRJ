In a dense forest, there is often limited light penetration due to the thick vegetation, resulting in reduced visibility. Therefore, a man is most likely to be unable to see if he gets lost in a dense forest. Option (B) is incorrect because a long river does not necessarily affect visibility. Option (C) is also incorrect because in a desert, there is usually good visibility due to the absence of dense vegetation. Option (D) may have reduced visibility due to fog, but it is not a characteristic of mountains in general."

If a man gets lost in a dense forest, it is highly likely that he will be unable to see his surroundings. Dense forests are characterized by thick vegetation, trees, and undergrowth, which can obstruct visibility and make it difficult to navigate or find landmarks. Option (B) is less likely because in a long river, there is generally more open space and fewer obstacles to obstruct visibility. Option (C) is also less likely because deserts often have wide, open spaces where visibility can be greater.
