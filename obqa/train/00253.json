Veins carry blood, which is responsible for transporting essential substances like oxygen, nutrients, and hormones throughout the body. Option (A) is incorrect because veins do contain enough fluid to carry blood. Option (C) is incorrect because veins play a crucial role in maintaining overall health by transporting blood. Option (D) is partially correct, as veins do help keep the body healthy by ensuring proper circulation, but the more accurate answer is (B) because it specifically highlights the role of veins in carting essential substances around."
