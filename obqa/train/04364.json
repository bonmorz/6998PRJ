Option (C), the seasons changing from winter to spring, is the most likely reason for Jerry's dog leaving more fur on the couch. Many dogs shed their winter coat in preparation for the warmer weather of spring. Option (A) is incorrect because the transition from fall to winter would generally result in less shedding. Option (B) is unlikely because hairless breeds do not have as much fur to shed. Option (D) is unrelated to shedding in dogs and is a distractor answer."

Option (A) can be eliminated because the transition from fall to winter is typically when dogs grow more fur in preparation for colder weather, not shed more fur. Option (B) can also be eliminated because if the dog is a hairless breed, it would not be leaving fur on the couch at all. Option (D) is unrelated to shedding patterns. Therefore, (C) is the correct answer because the transition from winter to spring is a time when dogs shed their winter coat in preparation for warmer weather."
