When wolves discover a new area with a high population of deer, they are likely to stay in that area because they can use the deer as a source of nutrition. Option (A) is incorrect because the wolves do not eat the same things that the deer eat. Option (B) is a subjective statement and not supported by scientific evidence. Option (C) is incorrect because wolves do not stay near deer for protection, but rather to hunt and feed on them."
