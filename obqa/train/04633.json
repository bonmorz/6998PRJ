Option (D) is the correct answer because an atom bomb, when detonated, releases an intense amount of heat energy in the form of thermal radiation, which is transferred via waves. This is known as thermal radiation or heat radiation. Option (A) is incorrect because a cat does not transfer heat via waves, but rather through conduction and convection (e.g., when they lie on warm surfaces or rub against you). Option (B) is incorrect because a rocket transfers heat through combustion and convection (e.g., burning fuel and expelling exhaust gases). Option (C) is incorrect because a car transfers heat through its engine and cooling system, which involve conduction and convection."
