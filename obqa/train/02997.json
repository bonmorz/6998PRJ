Option (A) of planting new trees actually has a positive impact on a habitat by providing more greenery and potentially more food sources for animals. Option (B) of a light drizzle may actually benefit a habitat by providing water and moisture for plants and animals. Option (C) of a human camping may have some impact depending on the actions of the human, but it is unlikely to render the habitat completely dead. Option (D) of an apartment complex, however, would likely have a significant negative impact on a habitat. Construction of an apartment complex would involve clearing land, destroying natural habitats, and disrupting ecosystems. It would result in the loss of biodiversity and natural resources, ultimately leading to a dead and degraded habitat. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer."

Option C, a human camping, does not necessarily indicate negative impact on the habitat, as it depends on the behavior of the human and how they interact with the environment.
