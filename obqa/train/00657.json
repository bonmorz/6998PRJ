Thermal energy transfer refers to the movement of heat from one object to another. Different materials have different abilities to conduct thermal energy. Metals, such as nickel, are good conductors of heat, while materials like wood, plastic, and rubber are poor conductors. Therefore, the person would choose bits of nickel as the construction material to conduct thermal energy effectively. Option (B) is incorrect because wood is a poor conductor of heat. Option (C) is incorrect because plastic is also a poor conductor of heat. Option (D) is incorrect because rubber is an insulator and does not conduct heat well."
