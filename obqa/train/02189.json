When a farmer plants varied crops over the years, it allows for a more balanced nutrient uptake from the soil and reduces the chance of pests and diseases targeting specific crops. This helps maintain soil fertility and overall health, resulting in a richer field. Option (B) is the correct answer because planting only grain crops can deplete specific nutrients from the soil, leading to poorer quality soil over time. Options (A), (C), and (D) all involve planting a combination of crops, which can help maintain soil health to some extent, but do not provide the same benefits as crop rotation with varied crops."
