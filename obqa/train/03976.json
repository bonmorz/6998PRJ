A revolution refers to an object or point moving in a circular or orbital path around something else, typically a central point. Option (A) is incorrect because dancing does not necessarily involve revolving around something. Option (B) is incorrect because poetry is a form of artistic expression and does not involve physical movement. Option (D) is incorrect because cupcakes do not revolve around anything. Option (C) is the correct answer because more physical matter can revolve around a central point, such as the planets revolving around the sun."
