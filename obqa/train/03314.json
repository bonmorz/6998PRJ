Option (D) is the correct answer because a solar stove uses solar energy, which is a renewable energy source that will not run out as long as the sun is shining. Option (A), a propane stove, relies on a non-renewable fossil fuel. Option (B), a gas stove, can also rely on non-renewable fossil fuels. Option (C), a corn stove, could potentially rely on a renewable energy source (corn biomass) but the question does not provide enough information to determine this, so it is not the best answer."
