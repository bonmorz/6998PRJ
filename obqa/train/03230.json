Option (D), peanuts and crackers, is the most likely pair to be consumed by squirrel families as peanuts are a common food for squirrels and crackers may be found in close proximity to human settlements. \n\nOption (A), bones and feathers, is incorrect because squirrels do not typically consume animal parts such as bones and feathers. \n\nOption (B), turkey and rocks, is incorrect because squirrels do not have the ability to hunt and capture larger animals like turkeys. Rocks are also not a part of their diet. \n\nOption (C), cardboard and sand, is incorrect because squirrels do not consume materials like cardboard and sand. They primarily eat nuts, seeds, fruits, and sometimes small insects."
