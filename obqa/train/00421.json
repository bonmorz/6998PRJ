Deforestation refers to the clearing of forests, which can lead to the death of trees. In the process of deforestation, trees are cut down, and their removal can lead to their death. Option (B) is incorrect because deforestation does not directly cause the death of oceans. Option (C) is unrelated to deforestation and refers to a type of solution.

Deforestation refers to the clearing of forests or trees from a particular area. This process can lead to the death of trees as they are cut down or destroyed, causing a loss of habitat for many species that rely on forests for survival. It can also disrupt the natural water cycle and contribute to soil erosion. While deforestation does have negative effects on the environment, options (B) and (C) are not directly caused by deforestation. Option (D) is related to deforestation, as the loss of trees and vegetation can contribute to an increase in greenhouse gases, leading to global warming. However, the most direct and immediate consequence of deforestation is the death of trees, making option (A) the correct answer."
