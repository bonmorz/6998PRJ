Wolves are carnivorous predators and typically show a distinction by chasing and hunting down small moving mammals as their prey. Option (A) is incorrect because it implies a preference for rabbit over lettuce, which is not relevant to wolf behavior. Option (B) is incorrect because it suggests that wolves would turn down vegetables as a food source, but they are primarily meat eaters. Option (D) is incorrect because it states that wolves would eat meat when given it, but this does not distinguish them from other animals as many animals eat meat."
