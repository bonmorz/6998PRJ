The increase in carbon dioxide is primarily a result of human activities such as burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, and industrial processes. As the human population has increased over the past decade, so has the demand for energy and resources, resulting in higher levels of carbon dioxide emissions. Human activities are the main driver of the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, leading to the current levels being higher than ever before."
