The southern hemisphere experiences opposite seasons compared to the northern hemisphere.

Therefore, in the arctic region (which is located in the northern hemisphere), it would be summer. Option (C) is correct because it corresponds to the correct season in the arctic region during the scientist's winter in the south pole.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because fall (autumn) is a transitional season and would not align with winter in the southern hemisphere. Option (B) is incorrect for the same reason as option (A), since it is not winter in the arctic region. Option (D) is incorrect because spring is the opposite season to autumn, and it would not match the winter in the southern hemisphere."
