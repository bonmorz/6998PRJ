This is because gravity is directly proportional to the mass of an object. Jupiter is a large planet with a high mass, so its gravitational force is stronger than that of smaller objects. Option (A) is incorrect because the view does not necessarily get better as you pass Jupiter. Option (C) is incorrect because moons orbit around planets, not individuals passing by.
