Nonrenewable resources, such as coal, are finite and cannot be replaced or replenished at the same rate at which they are being used. Option (A) is incorrect because being nonrenewable means it is not sought after as an alternate energy source, as it is not sustainable in the long term. Option (B) is incorrect because nonrenewable resources cannot be replaced with enough time. Option (D) is incorrect because nonrenewable resources have a limited supply and will eventually run out, causing the industry to cease to exist."
