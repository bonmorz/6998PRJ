When a person looks at their head in a mirror and moves toward it, an optical illusion known as the Ponzo illusion occurs. The brain interprets the converging lines created by the mirror as a depth cue, making the head appear larger. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. Option (B) is incorrect because there is no physical or biological reason for a head to explode in this scenario. Option (C) is incorrect because the head does not actually shrink, but appears larger due to the illusion. Option (D) is incorrect because the head does not disappear, but appears larger as the person approaches the mirror."
