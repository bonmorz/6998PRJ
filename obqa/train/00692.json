When the population of rabbits in an area increases, it can be attributed to various factors, but in this case, the most likely cause is the increase in precipitation. More precipitation leads to a more favorable environment for the growth of vegetation, which is a food source for rabbits. With more food available, the rabbit population can increase. Option (A) is incorrect because the presence of more predators would typically decrease the rabbit population. Option (B) is incorrect because infertility would cause a decrease in the rabbit population. Option (C) is incorrect because trapping the rabbits would also result in a decrease in their population."

This can lead to an increase in the availability of water and vegetation, which are essential resources for rabbits. With an abundance of food and water, the rabbits would have better conditions for survival and reproduction, resulting in an increase in their population.\n\nGiven the options and the fact that the question asks for a potential cause of the population increase, option (D) is the most likely answer."

Option (A) suggests that an increase in predators would actually decrease the rabbit population, so it can be ruled out as a possible cause for the population increase. Option (B) suggests that the rabbits themselves are becoming infertile, which would also result in a decrease in population, so it can be ruled out as well.\n\nOption (C) suggests that hunters are trapping the rabbits, which would actually decrease the population rather than increase it. Therefore, it can also be ruled out. That leaves us with option (D) - more precipitation falling lately.\n\nMore precipitation can lead to an increase in vegetation growth, which provides a greater food source for the rabbits. With more food available, the rabbits are likely to have more resources for survival and reproduction, leading to an increase in their population. Therefore, option (D) is the most likely cause for the increased rabbit population.\n\nIt's important to note that without further information or data, it is impossible to definitively determine the cause of the population increase.
