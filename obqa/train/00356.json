To determine the answer, we need to consider the properties of the materials given and their ability to reflect light. \n\nOption (A) is unlikely since wood is not typically reflective. \nOption (B) is also unlikely as plants do not possess reflective properties.\nOption (C) is also unlikely as clothing is usually made of fabrics that do not reflect light efficiently.\n\nOption (D) - rocks - seems to be the most logical choice. Some ancient societies used polished rocks as mirrors or reflective surfaces. Rocks have the potential to reflect light, especially if they are smooth and have reflective properties. Therefore, option (D) is the most appropriate answer based on our knowledge of ancient methods of using reflective materials."
