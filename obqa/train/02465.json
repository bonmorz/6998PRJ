When a forested area receives very little rain, the tall plants in that area may show thinner age markings. This is because the lack of water limits their growth and can result in slower development and thinner growth rings. Option (A) is incorrect because if there is very little rain, it is unlikely that the plants would shoot up in height. Option (B) is incorrect because most plants cannot thrive on saltwater. Option (C) is subjective and not necessarily true because plants may become weaker and more susceptible to stress and disease in drought conditions."

When a forested area receives very little rain, the tall plants in that area will show thinner age markings.

Option (A) is incorrect because limited rain would actually hinder the growth of plants. Option (B) is incorrect because most plants cannot tolerate saltwater. Option (C) is also incorrect because limited rainfall would actually weaken plants, as they would not have sufficient water and nutrients for optimal growth."
