When dirt is moved from one part of a forest to another and travels across a field, it is typically caused by gusts of wind.

Option (C) is incorrect because while trees can provide some resistance to wind, they do not actively move dirt from one place to another. Option (D) is incorrect because litter refers to trash or debris left by humans, which is not relevant to the movement of dirt in this context."
