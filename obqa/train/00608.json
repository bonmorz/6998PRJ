Crumpling refers to changing something from being smooth into a compacted shape by physical force. Option (B) states that crushing a can in your hand is an example of this process. When you crush a can, you are applying physical force to change its shape from smooth to compacted. Option (A) suggests folding a piece of paper into a shape, which does involve physical force, but it does not necessarily imply compacting the object. Option (C) mentions squishing a smooth bug, which again involves physical force, but does not necessarily result in a compacted shape. Option (D) mentions ripping up a piece of paper, which involves applying force, but does not result in a compacted shape either. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) crushing a can in your hand."
