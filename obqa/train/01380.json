Alternative fuels are typically derived from renewable sources such as biomass, solar power, wind power, or hydro power. These sources are considered assets because they are valuable and can be replenished or replaced. Option (A) is incorrect because sound is not related to alternative fuel. Option (B) is incorrect because a meal is not a characteristic of alternative fuel. Option (C) is incorrect because a drink is not a characteristic of alternative fuel."
