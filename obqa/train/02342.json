As dry soil becomes more broken up, it creates more space between the particles. This increased space allows for greater aeration and the presence of more oxygen in the soil. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) oxygen.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because as the soil becomes more broken up, it does not necessarily increase the amount of water it can hold. Option (B) is incorrect because the breaking up of dry soil does not directly contribute to an increase in calcium content. Option (D) is incorrect because while the breaking up of dry soil may result in smaller particles or stone fragments, it does not necessarily mean that there will be more rocks present in the soil."

Calcium can be present in soil from various sources but its concentration is not influenced by soil structure. \n\nOption (D) rocks is incorrect because as soil becomes more broken up, the size of the particles decreases and rocks are more likely to be removed or broken down into smaller particles.
