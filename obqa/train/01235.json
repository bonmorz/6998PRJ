As the size of a flower increases, it usually has more nectar and pollen to offer, attracting a larger number of pollinators. Option (A) is incorrect because it refers to the ability of butterflies to camouflage with flowers, not the relationship between flower size and pollinators. Option (B) is incorrect because it refers to ducks preferring to sleep in water with flowering water lilies, not the relationship between flower size and pollinators. Option (C) is incorrect because it refers to people preferring gardens with a large number of flowering plants, not the relationship between flower size and pollinators.
