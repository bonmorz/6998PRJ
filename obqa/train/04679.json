When something has great physical capacity, it implies that it is strong, capable, and able to perform physical tasks effectively. Therefore, it is most likely in fantastic health. Option (A) is incorrect because \"hardly healthy\" implies the opposite of great physical capacity. Option (B) is also incorrect because \"in poor health\" implies weakness or illness, which contradicts the idea of great physical capacity. Option (D) is incorrect because \"rarely healthy\" does not necessarily imply great physical capacity, and the question asks for the most likely option."
