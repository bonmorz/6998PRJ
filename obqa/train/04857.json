Option (C) \"flowing\" describes the movement of water, but if the body of water loses all water, there would be no flow. Option (D) \"growing\" implies an increase in size or quantity, which is not possible if all the water is lost.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) \"defunct.\" This word means no longer functioning or operating, which accurately describes a body of water that has lost all its water."
