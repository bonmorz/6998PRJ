This is not a conservation of resources either.\n\nOption (D), on the other hand, involves abstaining from riding a motorcycle. Motorcycles generally have a smaller engine and require less fuel compared to other vehicles, such as cars or trucks. By not riding a motorcycle, one would conserve fuel and reduce the demand for it. This conservation of fuel can be considered conserving resources.\n\nTherefore, option (D) - abstaining from riding a motorcycle, would be the choice that conserves resources."
