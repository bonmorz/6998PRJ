An animal that eats only plants is known as a herbivore. Option (A) refers to animals that eat meat. Option (C) refers to animals that eat both plants and meat. Option (D) refers to humans who choose not to eat meat, but it is not a universal term for plant-eating animals.\n\nQuestion: When an object is in motion, it has\n(A) potential energy (B) kinetic energy (C) no energy (D) solar energy\nAnswer: (B)\nExplanation: This question requires knowledge about the different forms of energy. When an object is in motion, it has kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. Option (A) refers to stored energy that can be converted into kinetic energy. Option (C) is incorrect because all objects in motion have some form of energy. Option (D) refers specifically to energy from the sun."
