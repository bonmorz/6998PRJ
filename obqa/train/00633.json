Sound waves are mechanical waves that require a medium to travel through, such as air, water, or solids. The option (D) is the correct answer because sound waves can travel through the air, which is a part of the sky. Option (A) is incorrect because sound cannot travel through the planet itself, it can only pass through the substances within it, such as the air or water. Option (B) is incorrect because sound cannot travel through the sun, which is a hot ball of gas. Option (C) is incorrect because sound can travel through the human body, but it is not limited to the body alone - it can also travel through other mediums."

Since the options given do not mention any specific medium, we can assume that the question is asking about the general medium through which sound can travel. The correct answer is (D) sky, because sound waves can travel through the air, which makes up the Earth's atmosphere. Option (A) planet is incorrect because sound cannot travel through the solid or molten core of the planet. Option (B) sun is incorrect because sound cannot travel through the vacuum of space. Option (C) body is incorrect because while sound can travel through our bodies, it can only do so because our bodies contain air and other mediums that sound can travel through."
