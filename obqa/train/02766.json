To propel herself on a bicycle, she would use foot levers, also known as pedals. Option (A), dark angel wings, is not a method of propelling a bicycle. Option (B), burning rocket fuel, is not environmentally friendly and not feasible for a bicycle. Option (C), using paparazzi cameras, is unrelated to riding a bicycle. Therefore, Option (D), using foot levers, is the correct answer."
