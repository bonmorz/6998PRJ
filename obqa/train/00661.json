Abusive relationships often have long-lasting negative effects on the abused person, including psychological trauma, low self-esteem, and trust issues. These negative impacts can make it more likely for them to enter into future bad relationships. Option (A) is incorrect because abusive relationships generally do not lead to future good relationships. Option (B) is incorrect because abusive relationships typically do not result in favorable outcomes. Option (D) is incorrect because abusive relationships are far from ideal situations."

Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer as it reflects the pattern often observed in such cases. Options (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect as they do not align with the negative consequences typically associated with abusive relationships."
