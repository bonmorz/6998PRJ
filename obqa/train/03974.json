Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the male reproductive organ of a flower to the female reproductive organ of another flower, resulting in fertilization. In some cases, wind can carry pollen from one flower to another, especially in plants that rely on wind for pollination. Option (A) is correct because wind-pollinated flowers often have similar genetic characteristics as they rely on wind to transport pollen over short distances. Options (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because they do not play a role in pollination."

Pollination occurs when pollen grains are transferred from the male reproductive organ of a flower to the female reproductive organ of another flower of the same species.

Option (A) is correct because when wind carries pollen, it is likely to land on flowers of the same species, leading to fertilization and the production of genetically similar offspring.
