To catch a chicken, a fox needs to use its speed, agility, and stealth to outmaneuver and capture the chicken. Option (B) states that the fox must always move exponentially quicker, which is a plausible strategy for a predator to catch its prey. Option (A) is unrelated and suggests ordering fast food. Option (C) is not a common hunting strategy for a fox and does not reflect the typical behavior of foxes. Option (D) is also unrelated because foxes are not known for swimming out to catch chickens."

In order for a fox to catch a chicken, it must move quickly and be able to catch up to the chicken. Option (B) is correct because the fox needs to be faster than the chicken in order to catch it. Option (A) is incorrect because ordering chicken from a fast food restaurant has no relevance to a fox catching a chicken in the wild. Option (C) is unlikely and not a common method for a fox to catch a chicken. Option (D) is also unlikely as foxes are not known for swimming to catch prey, especially chickens."
