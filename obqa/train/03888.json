We need to understand what it means for an object to be impervious and then assess the options based on their characteristics.\n\nBeing impervious means that something is unaffected or resistant to an outside force. In terms of an ax, an impervious object would not be easily cut or damaged by the ax.\n\nOption (A) is a thin branch. Thin branches are typically not strong and are easily cut or snapped with an ax, so they are not impervious.\n\nOption (B) is a neck. Although the human neck is a vulnerable part of the body, it is not impervious to an ax. The ax would easily cause severe damage to the neck.\n\nOption (C) is a twig. Similar to a thin branch, a twig is not impervious and would be easily cut or snapped by an ax.\n\nOption (D) is a boulder. A boulder is a large and solid rock, making it the most impervious of the options provided. It would be extremely difficult to cut or damage a boulder with an ax.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) a boulder, as it is the object most resistant to an ax."

An ax is a tool used for cutting, so something that is impervious to an ax would be something that cannot be easily cut or damaged by an ax.\n\nLooking at the options, we can eliminate option (A) - a thin branch - because a thin branch would likely be easily cut by an ax. We can also eliminate option (C) - a twig - because a twig is even thinner and more fragile than a branch, so it would be even easier to cut.\n\nNow we are left with options (B) - a neck - and (D) - a boulder. A neck is a vulnerable part of the human body and would not be impervious to an ax. On the other hand, a boulder is a large and solid rock, which is known to be extremely hard and difficult to break. Therefore, a boulder is the most likely option to be impervious to an ax.\n\nIn summary, option (D) - a boulder - is most impervious to an ax because it is a large and solid object that would be difficult to cut or damage with an ax."
