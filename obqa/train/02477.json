When many birds in an area are killed, it can disrupt the natural balance of the ecosystem. Birds are often predators of insects, so if there is a decrease in the bird population, the insect population may increase, resulting in an overcrowded ecosystem. Option (A) is incorrect because chickens are domesticated birds and not commonly found in wild ecosystems.
