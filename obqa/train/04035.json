In a power station that processes coal, the coal is burned to produce heat, which in turn is used to generate steam. The steam then drives a turbine, which is connected to a generator. The rotation of the turbine generates electricity. Therefore, option (A) is correct because electricity is \"reaped\" or generated in a power station that processes coal.
