Hurricanes thrive in warm and moist environments, so option (A) is the correct answer. The heat from a sweltering environment provides the energy needed for the hurricane to strengthen. Cold environments, such as those found in the polar regions, do not typically support hurricane formation or intensification. Option (C) is incorrect because a breezy environment does not necessarily provide the necessary heat and moisture for a hurricane to strengthen. Similarly, option (D) is incorrect because the absence of moisture in a dry environment would not support hurricane development."
