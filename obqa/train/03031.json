The correct answer is (A) tooth gap because physical traits, such as the size and shape of teeth, can be inherited from parents. Option (B) favorite color is incorrect because favorite color is not a physical trait and is not determined by genetics. Option (C) sense of fun is incorrect because personality traits are influenced by a combination of genetics and environmental factors, not just inheritance.
