The correct answer is option (A) - gasses with pollution. When certain gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, are released into the atmosphere from human activities like burning fossil fuels and industrial processes, they trap heat from the sun and contribute to the warming of the Earth's atmosphere. Option (B) is incorrect because acid rain is a result of air pollution, but it does not directly cause atmospheric warming. Option (C) is incorrect because while a nuclear war would have catastrophic consequences, it is not a phenomenon that directly causes atmospheric warming. Option (D) is incorrect because melting ice caps are a result of atmospheric warming, not a cause of it."

Nuclear war can have catastrophic and devastating effects on the environment, but its impact on atmospheric warming is not significant. Option (D) is incorrect because melting ice caps is a consequence of atmospheric warming, not a cause. The melting of ice caps leads to an increase in sea levels and can have various ecological and geographical effects, but it does not directly cause atmospheric warming."
