During photosynthesis, chlorophyll in plant cells absorbs sunlight and uses it to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a form of energy) and oxygen. \n\nAfter plants have used chlorophyll to make energy from sunlight, they do not use it right away (option A) because they need to store the glucose for future use. Option B is incorrect as plants cannot sell their energy to someone. Option D is also incorrect because plants do not have the ability to give their energy to a friend.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C \u2013 plants save the glucose (energy) produced from sunlight for future use. This stored energy can be used for growth, reproduction, or for times when sunlight is less available, such as during winter or drought periods."
