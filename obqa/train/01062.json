This can lead to the death of the fish population in the ponds since they are left without their habitat and a source of water. Option (B) is incorrect because plants rely on water for survival and without enough water during a drought, they are likely to struggle or die off. Option (C) is incorrect because a long drought typically results in a lack of resources and stress on animals, which can decrease reproductive rates. Option (D) is incorrect because tadpoles need water to grow and mature into frogs, so a lack of water during a drought would likely hinder their development."
