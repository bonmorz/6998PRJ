Out of the options given, a soda can is most likely to be conserved. This is because aluminum cans are highly recyclable and can be melted down and reused to make new cans. CO2 (option A) is a greenhouse gas and cannot be conserved in the same way as physical objects. Toilet paper (option B) is a consumable product that is typically used once and then discarded. Styrofoam (option D) is a non-biodegradable material that is difficult to recycle, making it less likely to be conserved compared to a soda can."

Option (A), CO2, is a gas that is released into the atmosphere and cannot be easily controlled or conserved. Option (B), toilet paper, is typically used once and then discarded, so it is not likely to be conserved. Option (D), styrofoam, is a material that is often used in disposable packaging and is not easily recycled or conserved. \n\nTherefore, option (C), a soda can, is the most likely to be conserved. Soda cans are made of aluminum, which is a highly recyclable material. In many places, there are recycling programs in which consumers can return their used soda cans to be melted down and made into new aluminum products. Additionally, the production of aluminum from recycled materials requires substantially less energy and resources compared to producing aluminum from raw materials.\n\nTherefore, of the options given, a soda can is the most likely to be conserved due to its recyclability and the existence of recycling programs."
