Different plants have different nutrient requirements, and if the same crop is grown in the same area year after year, it can deplete the soil of specific nutrients. Crop rotation involves planting different crops in succession, which helps to replenish and balance the nutrient levels in the soil. This can help save the land by minimizing nutrient depletion and maintaining soil health. Option (A) is incorrect because watering less does not address the issue of nutrient depletion. Option (C) is not related to sustainable agriculture practices. Option (D) is also incorrect because bringing in dirt does not address the specific nutrient requirements of different plants."
