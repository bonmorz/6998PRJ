Among the given options, cleaning companies are more likely to create a lot of waste. Cleaning companies often use disposable cleaning supplies such as paper towels and single-use cleaning wipes, which generate a significant amount of waste. Solar power companies (option A) are focused on renewable energy and do not typically produce a lot of waste. Recycling companies (option B) are actually dedicated to reducing waste by processing and reusing materials. Water production companies (option C) may generate waste in the form of packaging materials, but it is typically less than what cleaning companies produce. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is option (D) - cleaning companies."

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.\n\nOption (A), solar power companies, are not likely to create a lot of waste. While the production and installation of solar panels may generate some waste, the overall impact of solar power on waste generation is much lower compared to traditional forms of energy production.\n\nOption (B), recycling companies, are focused on reducing waste by collecting and processing materials for recycling. While they may handle a significant amount of waste, their primary goal is to minimize waste by diverting materials from landfills.\n\nOption (C), water production companies, may generate waste in the form of treatment by-products or packaging materials. However, the waste generated by water production companies is typically less significant compared to industries such as manufacturing or chemical production.\n\nTherefore, based on the given options, the industry that is likely to create a lot of waste is cleaning companies, making option (D) the correct answer."
