The statement implies that animals have innate behaviors or instincts. Option (A) is incorrect because it suggests that humans are unaware of animals' abilities, which is not relevant to the question. Option (B) is incorrect because it suggests a negative connotation, which is not relevant to the question. Option (D) is incorrect because not all of the options are applicable. Therefore, the correct answer is option (C), which states that the statement is affirmative in nature."
