Aluminum is a good conductor of heat, meaning it quickly spreads heat throughout its structure. This would explain why the entire barrel heated up when the flame torch was used on its side. Options (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect because these materials do not conduct heat as effectively as aluminum. Walnut is a wooden material and would burn when exposed to a flame torch. Ice would melt when exposed to heat and ceramic would retain the heat in a localized area, rather than distributing it throughout the barrel."
