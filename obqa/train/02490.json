When soil is disrupted to extreme levels, such as through excessive tilling or deforestation, it can have negative effects on the environment. The disruption can lead to soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and degradation of ecosystems. Option (A) is incorrect because plants do not thrive when soil is disrupted to extreme levels. Option (C) is unrelated to the effects of soil disruption. Option (D) is also unrelated, as bugs do not hoard as a result of soil disruption."

When soil is disrupted to extreme levels, it can cause negative effects on the environment. Option (A) is incorrect because plants do not thrive when soil is disrupted; they struggle to grow and survive.

Option (D) is also unrelated to the question as it refers to the behavior of bugs hoarding, which is not directly related to soil disruption. Only option (B) states the correct answer, as environments indeed suffer when soil is disrupted to extreme levels."
