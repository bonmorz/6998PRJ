Squirrels are known to engage in food caching behavior, where they collect and store food for future use. Option (A) states that squirrels save nuts when summer is hotter than the current season. This scenario is likely because during hotter summers, food sources may become scarce, so squirrels would save nuts to ensure they have enough food to sustain themselves during the scarcity. \n\nOption (B) is incorrect because it states that squirrels never save food, which contradicts their known behavior of food caching. Option (C) is incorrect because it states that squirrels eat when it rains outside only, which does not align with their need to store food for times of scarcity. Option (D) is incorrect because it states that squirrels save nuts when humans make them, which does not make logical sense in terms of the behavior of squirrels. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely scenario."
