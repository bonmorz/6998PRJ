Hybrid cars combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor, which allows for improved fuel efficiency. The electric motor helps to reduce the amount of fuel used by the internal combustion engine, resulting in lower gas usage.\n\nOption (A) is the correct answer because newer hybrid cars, with advancements in technology, are designed to be even more fuel-efficient than their predecessors. This means that over time, as more people switch to hybrid cars, the overall gas usage in the world will decrease.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because the whole purpose of hybrid cars is to reduce gas usage, so it would be counterintuitive for newer hybrid cars to result in more gas usage.\n\nOption (C) is also incorrect because while newer hybrid cars may have more electric components, they still rely on gasoline as a fuel source. The transition to fully electric cars would have a greater impact on reducing gas usage.\n\nOption (D) is unrelated to the question as it does not address the impact of hybrid cars on gas usage."

Option (A) is the correct answer. Option (B) is incorrect because hybrid cars are designed to be more fuel-efficient, not less. Option (C) is partially correct, but it does not capture the whole picture. While newer hybrid cars may have enhanced electric capabilities, they still rely on gas power to some extent. Option (D) is unrelated to the gas usage and refers to a different characteristic of cars."
