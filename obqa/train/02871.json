Natural resources are materials or substances that occur naturally and can be used for economic gain. Examples include water, minerals, forests, and oil. When humans are reckless in their actions and do not carefully manage and conserve these resources, the amount of resources will decrease. Option (B) is incorrect because resources cannot laugh. Option (C) is unlikely because reckless actions typically lead to a depletion of resources. Option (D) is nonsensical as resources cannot fly away."
