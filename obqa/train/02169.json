The frictional force depends on the roughness of the surfaces, with rougher surfaces creating more friction.\n\nAmong the given options, gravel would create the most friction when a ball is rolled over it. Gravel consists of small, irregularly shaped particles with varying sizes. These particles are not as smooth as glass or marble surfaces.\n\nWhen the ball rolls over gravel, the uneven surface of the gravel particles creates more contact points between the ball and the gravel. This increased contact area results in more microscopic interactions and a higher frictional force.\n\nOn the other hand, glass and marble surfaces are usually smooth, with fewer contact points and therefore less friction. Ice is a special case because it can create both low and high friction depending on whether it is dry or wet. Dry ice can have a relatively low friction coefficient, while wet or icy ice can have a higher coefficient of friction.\n\nHence, the correct answer is (B) gravel, as it provides a rougher surface compared to the other options and creates the most friction when rolling a ball over it."
