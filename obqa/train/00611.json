As the bear moves through the environment and eventually defecates, it can help disperse the seeds of the berries in different locations. This process is known as seed propagation. Option (A) is incorrect because while the bear's food consumption may support its young, it is not the primary purpose of eating berries. Option (B) is incorrect because hunters are not directly related to the process of bears eating berries. Option (D) is incorrect because the bear's hunger is a result of eating berries, not a process itself."
