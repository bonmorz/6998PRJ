Option (A), a tree, does not eat fish and does not live in marshland, so it can be eliminated. Option (B), a whale, primarily lives in the open ocean and typically does not eat fish found in marshland. Option (C), a warthog, primarily eats plants and does not eat fish, so it can be eliminated. Option (D), an alligator, is known to eat fish and is commonly found in marshland habitat. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) an alligator."
