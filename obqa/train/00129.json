This is a well-documented behavior where otters will select a suitable rock and use it to crack open the shells of clams or other shelled prey. Option (A) is incorrect because while birds do use twigs to build nests, this is not considered tool use as it is part of their innate behavior. Option (C) is also incorrect because anteaters using their tongues to catch ants is not considered tool use either, as their tongue is a specialized adaptation. Option (D) is incorrect because koalas using their pouch to hold infants is not tool use, but a natural feature of their biology."

In this case, the chimpanzees are using sticks to dig for insects.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because birds using twigs to build nests is an example of construction behavior, not tool use. The twigs are not being used to manipulate the environment or achieve a specific goal.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because anteaters using their tongue to catch ants is a natural adaptation, not tool use. The tongue is part of the anteater's anatomy and is not an external object being used as a tool.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because koalas using their pouch to hold infants is a biological adaptation, not tool use. The pouch is a natural feature of the koala's body and is not an external object being used as a tool.\n\nOption (B) is the correct answer because otters using rocks to open clams is a clear example of tool use. The otters are selecting and manipulating rocks to achieve the goal of opening the clams and accessing the meat inside. This behavior demonstrates problem-solving and the ability to use objects as tools."
