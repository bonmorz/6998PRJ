If a dog is getting noticeably skinnier, it is likely not getting enough nutrients from its current food intake.

Playing video games would not address the dog's nutritional needs. \n\nOption (C) is incorrect because if the dog is already losing weight, feeding it less food would only worsen the problem and potentially lead to further weight loss and health issues. \n\nOption (D) is completely unrelated to the issue of the dog's weight and is not a viable solution. Making a dog fly away is not possible and would not address the underlying cause of the weight loss."
