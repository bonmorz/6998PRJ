Over the course of several decades, rough winds can cause the large stones on a beach to break down into smaller pieces, resulting in tiny grains of sand. Option (A) is incorrect because jungle brush would not typically be found on a beach. Option (B) is incorrect because if the beach had large stones several decades ago, it is unlikely that enormous boulders would exist now. Option (D) is incorrect because tall trees would not typically grow on a beach due to the sandy soil and saltwater exposure."
