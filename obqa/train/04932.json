The hydrologic cycle refers to the movement of water between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. One of the key processes in this cycle is evaporation, where water from bodies of water, such as oceans and lakes, is converted into water vapor and rises into the atmosphere. As the water vapor rises, it cools and condenses into tiny water droplets or ice crystals, forming clouds.\n\nThe primary driver of the hydrologic cycle and cloud formation is energy from a central star, which in our case is the Sun. The energy from the Sun heats the Earth's surface, causing water to evaporate and rise into the atmosphere. This energy also drives the movement of air masses, leading to the formation of weather patterns and the stirring of water vapor in the atmosphere.\n\nOption (A) is a nonsensical statement and unrelated to the hydrologic cycle. Option (B), how soiled the clothing is, has no relevance to cloud formation. Option (C), energy from a gun, is also unrelated to the natural processes of the hydrologic cycle. Only option (D), energy from a central star, specifically the Sun, is correct as it aligns with the known scientific explanations for cloud formation in the hydrologic cycle."

The hydrologic cycle, also known as the water cycle, involves the continuous movement of water between the atmosphere, land, and bodies of water such as oceans and rivers.

This solar energy provides the heat necessary to cause water to evaporate from its liquid state into a gas (water vapor). As the water vapor rises into the atmosphere, it cools and condenses, forming clouds. Therefore, solar energy from the sun is responsible for driving the hydrologic cycle and producing clouds. \n\nThe other options are not related to the hydrologic cycle or cloud formation.
