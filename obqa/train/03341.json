Polar bears have thick fur to help them survive in frigid places like the Arctic. The thick fur provides insulation and helps them retain body heat in extremely cold temperatures. Option (A) is incorrect because it implies that polar bears intentionally grew thick fur to be hunted, which does not make sense and is not supported by scientific evidence. Option (C) is incorrect because polar bears do not live in deserts. Option (D) is incorrect because the rainforest is a warm and humid environment, where thick fur would not be beneficial for heat retention."
