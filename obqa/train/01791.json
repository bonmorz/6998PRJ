Perspiration helps to regulate body temperature by evaporating from the skin and cooling the body down. If someone were to cease perspiration, they would be most at risk for overheating because their body would not be able to release heat effectively. Option (A) is incorrect because hypothermia refers to abnormally low body temperature. Option (B) is incorrect because seizures are not directly related to perspiration. Option (D) is incorrect because cramps can be caused by various factors, but the cessation of perspiration does not directly lead to cramps."
