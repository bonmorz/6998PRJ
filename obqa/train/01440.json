Acquired characteristics are traits that are not passed down through genes but instead are developed or acquired during an organism's lifetime. Option (B), the length of a horse's mane, is an example of an acquired characteristic because it can change throughout a horse's life due to factors like grooming, environmental conditions, or training methods. Option (A), the thickness of a horse's mane, is more likely to be an inherited trait because it is determined by the horse's genetic makeup. Option (C), the number of legs a horse has, is an incorrect option because the number of legs is an innate characteristic and not subject to change or influence during an individual's lifetime. Option (D), the color of a horse's mane, is also more likely to be an inherited trait and not easily influenced by acquired factors."

An acquired characteristic is a trait that an organism develops throughout its lifetime in response to its environment, while an inherited trait is passed down from parent to offspring through genes. The thickness and color of a horse's mane are inherited traits that are determined by its genetics, not acquired through its environment. The number of legs a horse has is a fixed trait and cannot be acquired. However, the length of a horse's mane can be influenced by environmental factors such as nutrition and grooming practices. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer as it reflects an acquired characteristic."
