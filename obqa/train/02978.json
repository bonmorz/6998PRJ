Waxy leaves have a waxy coating on their surface, which helps to reduce water loss through evaporation. This coating also makes the leaves more slippery, allowing water to run off easily. This characteristic of waxy leaves makes them suitable for rainforests and other moist environments. Option (D), clothes, is the correct answer because this option refers to the slippery nature of waxy leaves and their suitability for shedding water, similar to how waterproof clothing is designed to repel water. Options (A), (B), and (C) are emotions and not related to the characteristics of waxy leaves."
