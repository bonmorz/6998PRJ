Option (C) is the correct answer because building in an animal habitat can destroy or disrupt the natural environment, reducing the available resources and potentially forcing the animals to relocate or leading to their extinction. Options (A), (B), and (D) are all incorrect because they imply non-interference, which typically does not harm animal habitats. In fact, options (A) and (B) are positive actions that can help preserve animal habitats, while option (D) simply refers to not paying attention, which does not have a direct impact on the habitat."
