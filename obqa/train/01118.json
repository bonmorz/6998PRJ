When a liquid's temperature increases, it typically has the opposite effect on solid substances. Option (A) is the correct answer because when a hot liquid is poured over ice cream, the ice cream will melt and deliquesce (become liquid) faster due to the higher temperature of the liquid. Option (B) is incorrect because rocks do not typically melt when liquid is poured over them. Option (C) is incorrect because liquids typically do not harden when they are poured. Option (D) is incorrect because a hot liquid will generally increase the temperature of objects it touches rather than cooling them down."
