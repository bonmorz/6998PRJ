Keeping shopping bags out of the dump, for example by recycling or reusing them, has a positive impact on the earth. When shopping bags end up in landfills, they can take a long time to decompose, releasing harmful pollutants into the environment. By reducing the amount of waste going into landfills, we reduce pollution and conserve resources. Option (A) is incorrect because keeping shopping bags out of the dump has a positive impact rather than a neutral one.

Additionally, when shopping bags are not disposed of properly, they can end up as litter in the environment, causing pollution and harm to wildlife. Therefore, option (B) - positively - is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because it implies no impact, but reducing waste in landfills has a positive impact.
