The most effective way for a horse to cool down in this situation is by perspiring (option D). Horses sweat as a way to release heat from their bodies and maintain a stable core temperature. When a horse perspires, the sweat evaporates from its skin, taking away heat with it. This helps the horse cool down and avoid overheating. \n\nOption A (eating) is incorrect because eating does not directly help the horse cool down in this situation.
