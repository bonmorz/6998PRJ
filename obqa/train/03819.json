Glass is a relatively hard material, so only materials that are harder than glass can scratch it. Option (B) states that a crystal that regulates electronic oscillators in watches can scratch glass easily. Crystals are typically harder than glass, so this option is correct. \n\nOption (A) states that a rubber pencil eraser can scratch glass easily. Rubber erasers are soft and not harder than glass, so this option is incorrect. \n\nOption (C) states that a soft linen towel can scratch glass easily. Soft towels are not harder than glass, so this option is incorrect. \n\nOption (D) states that a round piece of ice can scratch glass easily. Ice is not typically harder than glass, so this option is incorrect."
