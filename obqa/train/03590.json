The magnetic north pole is the point on Earth towards which the north end of a compass needle points. If someone wants to walk towards the magnetic north pole, they should walk parallel to the way their compass is pointing. This is because the compass needle aligns with the Earth's magnetic field lines, and walking parallel to the needle will take them in the direction of the magnetic north pole. Option (A) is incorrect because walking to the east would take them away from the magnetic north pole. Option (C) is also incorrect because walking perpendicular to the way a compass is pointing would not lead them towards the magnetic north pole.

The magnetic north pole is the point on the Earth's surface towards which a compass needle points. The needle is magnetized and aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field, which has a north and south pole. When someone wants to walk towards the magnetic north pole, they should walk parallel to the way their compass is pointing. This means that they should keep the compass needle lined up with the direction they are walking. Option (A) is incorrect because walking to the east would take them away from the magnetic north pole. Option (C) is incorrect because walking perpendicular (or at a right angle) to the way the compass is pointing would also take them away from the magnetic north pole.
