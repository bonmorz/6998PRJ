The sun, which is a large yellow dwarf star, is the source of heat and light for the Earth.

Option (A) is incorrect because the sun is not hollow, it is a dense ball of gas. Option (C) is incorrect because the sun is not the furthest star from the Earth, there are many other stars that are much further away.
