When the balloon is filled with helium gas, it becomes buoyant because helium is lighter than air. When the balloon is opened and pressed up to someone's mouth, the helium gas inside the balloon fills the space in the vocal tract, including the vocal cords. As a result, the sound waves produced by the vocal cords resonate differently in the presence of helium gas compared to air. This change in resonance causes the voice to sound higher or \"squeaky.\" Option (A) correctly explains that the gas fills the new area in the vocal tract, altering the resonance of the sound waves and causing the higher voice pitch. Option (B) is incorrect because gas dispersion does not explain the change in voice pitch. Option (C) is incorrect because gas movement is not directly related to the change in voice pitch.

Option (A) is the correct answer because the gas fills the new area created by the person's vocal tract. Option (B) is incorrect because gas does not easily disperse in this scenario.

Helium is lighter than air, so when the balloon is filled with helium and is opened near someone's mouth, the gas fills the new area (the person's mouth and vocal cords).

Option (B) is incorrect because gas dispersion alone does not explain the change in voice pitch.

                "content": "To understand why a balloon filled with helium makes a person's voice high, we need to know some basic physics and the properties of helium gas. Helium is a lighter gas than air, which means it has a lower density. When the balloon is filled with helium, the gas inside has a lower density than the air around it. \n\nNow when the balloon is opened and pressed up to someone's mouth, they speak or make sounds through the balloon. When sound waves travel through different mediums, they can be affected by the properties of those mediums. In this case, when the sound waves pass through the helium-filled balloon, the gas in the balloon starts to displace some of the air in the person's vocal tract.\n\nSince helium is lighter than air and has a lower density, it causes the speed of sound to increase in the vocal tract. The increased speed of sound alters the resonance of the vocal tract, making the person's voice higher. This is similar to how different instruments produce different sounds due to the variations in the size, shape, and materials of their resonating chambers.\n\nOption (A) is the correct answer because when the balloon is opened, the helium gas fills the new area inside the vocal tract, affecting the resonance and making the voice high. Option (B) is incorrect because gas dispersion is not the main factor that causes the change in voice pitch. Option (C) is not directly related to why the voice becomes high. Option (D) is partially correct, as helium is indeed lighter than air, but the main reason for the voice change is the change in resonance caused by the lower density gas filling the vocal tract."
