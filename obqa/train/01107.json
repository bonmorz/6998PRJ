Heat, temperature, and warmth are all related concepts, so all of the options are correct in this case. Option (A) is true because heat is a form of energy and an increase in temperature is associated with an increase in heat. Option (B) is true because temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance, and the increase in mercury indicates a rise in temperature. Option (C) is also true because warmth is a subjective perception of temperature, and an increase in temperature can be interpreted as a rise in warmth."
