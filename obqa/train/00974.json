Option (A) states that a speech lacks molecules. A speech is a form of communication and does not have a physical presence. It consists of words and ideas, which do not have molecules. Option (B) is incorrect because a dog, like any living organism, is made up of molecules. Option (C) is also incorrect because a book is made up of paper, ink, and other materials that are composed of molecules. Option (D) is incorrect because a grape is a living organism and is made up of molecules."

Speech is not a physical object and is made up of sounds produced by the vocal cords. It does not have a molecular structure, so it lacks molecules.\n\nOption (B) is a dog, which is a living organism made up of cells. Cells are composed of molecules, so a dog does have molecules.\n\nOption (C) is a book, which is a physical object made up of paper and ink.
