When a person gently tosses a ball to a friend, if the friend misses the catch, the ball will fall down and meet the ground or dirt. This is because of the force exerted on the ball by gravity, causing it to follow a parabolic trajectory and eventually come into contact with the Earth's surface. Option (B) is incorrect because it implies that the ball will stop moving completely, which is unlikely unless it hits an obstacle. Option (C) is unrealistic because clouds are high up in the atmosphere and it is highly unlikely for a tossed ball to reach such heights. Option (D) is also unrealistic because reaching new heights implies the ball gaining altitude, which is not the case when a person tosses it to a friend."
