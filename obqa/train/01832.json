In arid places where there are no puddles, lakes, or rainfall, birds have to be resourceful. Option (A), poking a tough plant, refers to the behavior of certain birds that know how to extract water from the moist parts of cacti or other desert plants. They use their beaks to poke into the plant and access the water stored inside. Option (B), eating a small stone, is incorrect because eating a stone will not provide the bird with water. Option (C), taking out a loan, is a play on words and not related to the topic of birds finding water. Option (D), crying for a minute, is also incorrect as crying does not help a bird find water in an arid environment."
