Corn, specifically the outer layer of the corn kernel, contains a substance called cellulose which is difficult for humans to digest. This is why it is not uncommon to see whole corn kernels in stool. Spinach, water, and eggs do not contain the same level of indigestible substances as corn, making them easier to digest. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer."

In order to answer this question, we need some basic knowledge of the digestive system and the types of foods that are more difficult to digest. \n\nOption (A), corn, might be harder to digest compared to the other options. Corn contains a substance called cellulose, which is a type of fiber that humans cannot fully break down. This means that corn can pass through the digestive system largely intact, making it more difficult to digest. \n\nOption (B), spinach, is generally easier to digest compared to corn. Spinach is a leafy green vegetable that contains less indigestible fiber compared to corn.\n\nOption (C), water, is not typically considered a food that requires digestion. Water is easily absorbed by the body and does not undergo the same digestive process as solid foods.\n\nOption (D), eggs, are generally easier to digest compared to corn. Eggs contain protein and healthy fats that our bodies can easily break down and utilize.\n\nTherefore, based on the given options, corn (option A) might be harder to digest compared to the other food items."
