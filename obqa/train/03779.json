Offspring typically inherit certain traits, including coloration and body characteristics, from their parents. Options (A), (C), and (D) are not likely to receive their coloration and hairy body from their parents because parakeets, tunas, and groupers have different methods of reproduction and inherited traits. However, voles, like Valentina, reproduce sexually and inherit their traits from their parents, making option (B) the correct choice."
