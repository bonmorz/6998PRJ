It would take approximately half an hour for us to notice the sun's movement across the sky. This is because the movement of the sun is relatively slow and gradual. It moves approximately 15 degrees per hour, and for us to notice this movement, we would need to observe the position of the sun over a period of time. \n\nOption (B) is incorrect because 15 seconds is too short of a time frame to perceive the sun's movement. Option (C) is also incorrect because half a minute is not long enough to notice the sun's movement. Option (D) is clearly incorrect as one nanosecond is an incredibly short period of time during which we would not be able to perceive any movement."

The correct answer is (A) half an hour. \n\nTo understand why, we need to consider the speed at which the Earth rotates and the apparent movement of the sun in the sky. The Earth takes approximately 24 hours to complete one full rotation on its axis. This rotation causes the sun to appear to move across the sky.\n\nSince the Earth takes 24 hours to complete a full rotation, this means that it takes 12 hours for the sun to move from the eastern horizon to the western horizon. Therefore, in half an hour, the sun would have moved a small fraction of this distance and it would be difficult for an individual to notice this movement with the naked eye.\n\nOption (B) 15 seconds and option (C) half a minute are both too short of a time frame for a noticeable movement of the sun. Option (D) one nanosecond is an extremely short period of time, far too brief for any noticeable movement to occur. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) half an hour."

The Earth completes one full rotation in approximately 24 hours.

Therefore, it would take about 30 minutes for us to notice a noticeable change in the sun's position.\n\nOption (A) \"half an hour\" is the correct answer because it aligns with the explanation above.
