Refraction occurs when light passes from one medium to another with a different refractive index. Objects made of melted sand, also known as glass, cause refraction of light because of the way light interacts with the molecules in the glass. Option (A) is incorrect because wind, being a flow of air, does not have the necessary properties to cause refraction. Option (B) is incorrect because wood does not have the same molecular structure as glass, so it does not cause significant refraction. Option (D) is incorrect because soil, like wood, does not have the necessary properties for refraction to occur."
