Pollution is caused by various factors, including the improper disposal of substances that can harm the environment. Prescription medicine being put down sink drains is one such example. When medicine is flushed or washed down the sink, it enters the water system and can contaminate rivers, lakes, and oceans, causing pollution. Option (A) is incorrect as reusing cloth baby diapers actually helps reduce pollution by reducing waste. Option (B) is also incorrect as recycling plastic water bottles helps to reduce pollution by reducing the need for new plastic production. Option (C) is incorrect as using all natural household cleaners can also help reduce pollution by avoiding the use of harmful chemicals."

Pollution refers to the introduction of harmful substances or pollutants into the environment, which can have negative effects on ecosystems and human health.\n\nAmong the given options, option (D) is the correct answer because prescription medicine being put down sink drains can contribute to pollution. When medicine is disposed of in this way, it can enter the water supply and have adverse effects on aquatic organisms and ecosystems. Medications can contain chemicals that are harmful to the environment and can disrupt natural processes.\n\nOptions (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect. Reusing cloth baby diapers (option A) is actually an eco-friendly and sustainable choice, as it reduces waste and the use of disposable diapers. Recycling plastic water bottles (option B) helps to reduce the amount of plastic waste in landfills and oceans. Using all-natural household cleaners (option C) is also a more environmentally friendly choice, as it reduces the use of harsh chemicals that can be harmful to ecosystems.
