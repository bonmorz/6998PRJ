Summer typically refers to the period of time between the months of June, July, and August in many parts of the world.

Since summer typically lasts for about three months, option (A) is the correct answer.

To determine the length of summer the boy has to endure, we need to convert the given time periods into the same unit of measurement. Since the options are given in weeks, we need to convert the other time periods into weeks as well. \n\nIf we convert three years to weeks, we know that there are 52 weeks in a year, so three years would be 52 x 3 = 156 weeks. \n\nIf we convert nine months to weeks, we know that there are approximately 4.33 weeks in a month, so nine months would be 4.33 x 9 = 39 weeks. \n\nIf we convert two days to weeks, we know that there are 7 days in a week, so two days would be 2/7 = 0.285 weeks. \n\nTherefore, the option with the shortest time period is (A) twelve weeks, which is the correct answer. The other options have longer time periods, so the boy would have to endure summer for a longer duration."
