An adaptation is a trait or characteristic that helps an organism survive and thrive in its environment. Humans have created many adaptations through the help of science, such as technologies and inventions that improve our quality of life. Option (D) \"flying\" is the correct answer because humans have created airplanes, helicopters, and other forms of flight through scientific advancements. Option (A) \"freckles\" is incorrect because freckles are a natural variation of pigmentation in the skin and not an adaptation created through science. Option (B) \"feces\" is incorrect because feces is a waste product of digestion and not an adaptation. Option (C) \"eye color\" is incorrect because eye color is determined by genetic factors and not an adaptation created through science."
