While all of the options are possible ways to reduce lung damage compared to regular smoking, the question asks which option contributes more, though less than some believe.\n\nOption (A), smoking less, would indeed contribute to reducing lung damage because the more someone smokes, the more harmful substances they inhale into their lungs. However, the question specifies that this option contributes less than some believe, indicating that it is not the most significant factor.\n\nOption (B), switching to chewing, refers to using chewing tobacco instead of smoking. Chewing tobacco still poses significant health risks, including an increased risk of oral and throat cancers, but it involves less inhalation of smoke into the lungs. However, the question again specifies that this option contributes less than some believe, suggesting that it is not the most significant factor either.\n\nOption (C), no filters, refers to smoking cigarettes without any filters. While filters have been marketed as reducing the harm caused by smoking, they do not eliminate it entirely. In fact, filters can give a false sense of safety, leading people to take larger and more frequent puffs, thereby increasing their overall exposure to harmful substances. Therefore, smoking without filters would contribute more to lung damage compared to the other options mentioned.\n\nOption (D), switching to e-cigs, refers to using electronic cigarettes, which do not involve burning tobacco but instead heat and vaporize a liquid. While e-cigs are often marketed as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes, there is still ongoing debate and research regarding their long-term health effects. Some studies have suggested that e-cigs may still have harmful effects on lung health, although they are likely to be less damaging than traditional cigarettes. Therefore, they may contribute less to lung damage compared to smoking without filters.\n\nIn summary, based on the information provided in the question, option (C), no filters, is the answer that contributes more, though less than some believe, to the lung damage caused by smoking."

While e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco and do not produce smoke, they still contain harmful chemicals which can cause lung damage. So, this option may reduce lung damage compared to traditional smoking, but it is unlikely to be the correct answer in this context.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) no filters. Filters found in cigarettes are designed to trap some of the harmful chemicals and particles in the smoke, reducing their intake by the smoker. However, even with the filter, smoking still causes significant lung damage. So, by removing the filters, a smoker would be exposed to more of these harmful chemicals, contributing more to the lung damage caused by smoking."
