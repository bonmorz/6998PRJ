Confetti is small, decorative pieces of paper that are typically thrown or scattered during celebrations. It is made by cutting or punching shapes out of sheets of paper. \n\nOption (A) - color: When making confetti, the color of the paper may remain the same as the original sheets or it may be different. Therefore, this option is not always true and cannot be the correct answer.\n\nOption (B) - pattern: The pattern on the original sheets of paper may or may not be present in the confetti. Confetti can be made from solid colored paper or patterned paper. So this option is not always true and cannot be the correct answer.\n\nOption (C) - temperature: The temperature of the paper does not change when making confetti. The cutting or punching process does not involve any change in temperature. Therefore, this option is not true and cannot be the correct answer.\n\nOption (D) - shape: The correct answer is shape. When we make confetti, we cut or punch the paper into various shapes, such as circles, squares, or triangles. The original sheets of paper typically do not have these specific shapes, so the shape of the confetti differs from the original sheets. Therefore, this option is true and is the correct answer.\n\nIn conclusion, when making confetti, the shape of the confetti differs from the original sheets of paper."
