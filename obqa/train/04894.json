Shivering is the body's natural response to cold temperatures in order to generate heat and maintain body temperature. Option (B) is correct because high mountain peaks tend to have lower temperatures due to the altitude, making it more likely for someone to feel cold and shiver. Option (A) is incorrect because coastal areas tend to have more moderate temperatures. Option (C) is incorrect because being on an island does not necessarily have an impact on temperature.
