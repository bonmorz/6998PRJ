As a flower becomes more aromatic, it will bring in a growing crowd of pollinators. These pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, are attracted to the scent of the flower and help in the process of pollination. Option (A) is incorrect because lazy tourists are not attracted to flower scents. Option (B) is incorrect because leaf miners are insects that feed on the leaves of plants and are not typically attracted to flower scents. Option (D) is incorrect because caterpillars are the larval stage of butterflies and moths and may eat parts of the flower, but they are not the primary organisms attracted by the flower's scent."
