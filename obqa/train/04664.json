Water freezes at a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). Option (A), a thimble of water, would freeze first because it has the least amount of water to cool down. Option (B), a pond of water, would freeze second because it has a larger volume of water and thus more thermal energy to cool down. Option (C), a glass of water, would freeze third for the same reasons as option (B). Option (D), an ocean of water, would freeze last because it has an extremely large volume of water and would take the longest time for the heat to be removed and reach the freezing temperature."

The freezing time of water depends on its volume and the rate at which heat is lost. An ocean of water has the largest volume, so it would take the longest time to freeze compared to the other options. A thimble of water has the smallest volume, so it would freeze the quickest. A pond of water and a glass of water have intermediate volumes and would freeze at different rates, but both would freeze faster than an ocean of water.

Water has a high heat capacity, which means it can absorb a lot of heat energy before it starts to freeze. The greater the volume of water, the more heat it can absorb before freezing.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because a thimble of water has a small volume and can freeze relatively quickly. Option (B) is incorrect because although a pond has a larger volume than a thimble, it is still smaller than a glass or an ocean. Option (C) is incorrect because a glass of water has a smaller volume than an ocean. Option (D) is correct because an ocean of water has an enormous volume, which means it can absorb a significant amount of heat energy before freezing.

The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). Option (D) states that an ocean of water would freeze last compared to the other options. This is because larger bodies of water, such as an ocean, have a larger heat capacity. Heat capacity refers to the amount of heat energy that needs to be extracted from a substance in order for its temperature to decrease. Due to the large volume of water in an ocean, it would take longer for it to reach the freezing point compared to a thimble, a glass, or a pond of water. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because a thimble of water has a smaller volume and would freeze faster. Option (B) is incorrect because, although it may take longer to freeze compared to a thimble of water, a pond of water is smaller than an ocean and would freeze before an ocean.
