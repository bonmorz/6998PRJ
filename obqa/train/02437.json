A year is defined as the time it takes for the Earth to complete one orbit around the sun. It has nothing to do with the time it takes to perform tasks like heating up a hot pocket, taking off shoes, or washing dishes. Option (B) is too specific and unrelated to the Earth's orbit. Option (C) and (D) are tasks that can be completed in a matter of minutes or even seconds, while a year takes approximately 365 days. Option (A) is the correct answer because it describes the Earth's orbit around a heat source (the sun) as the measure of time passing."
