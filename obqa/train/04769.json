Option (B) is the correct answer because growing nothing but corn year after year can lead to a decrease in crop yield due to nutrient depletion in the soil. Corn is a heavy feeder that depletes specific nutrients from the soil, and if not properly managed, this can lead to reduced yields. Option (A) is incorrect because switching to sustainable farming practices would typically result in improved crop yields. Option (C) is also incorrect because integrating livestock and crops can actually be beneficial for crop yields through nutrient cycling and pest control.

Option (A) suggests switching to sustainable farming practices, which typically focus on environmentally-friendly methods and preservation of resources. Sustainable farming is unlikely to be the cause of a decreasing crop yield.\n\nOption (C) suggests raising both livestock and crops. While it is possible that livestock farming could have negative effects on crop yield (such as competition for resources or increased risk of pests), this method alone may not necessarily be the cause.\n\nOption (D) suggests using hydroponics in farming. Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil, instead using a nutrient-rich water solution. While hydroponics can improve crop yield and reduce resource usage, it is not likely to be the cause of a decreasing crop yield.\n\nOption (B) suggests growing nothing but corn. This method is more likely to cause a decreasing crop yield over time. Growing only one crop, known as monoculture, can deplete the soil of specific nutrients and increase the risk of pests and diseases that specifically target corn. Monoculture also lacks the benefits of crop rotation, which helps replenish soil nutrients and pest control.\n\nTherefore, option (B) is the most likely method causing the worse crop yield every year."
