A living thing is typically defined as an organism that has the ability to grow, reproduce, respond to stimuli, maintain homeostasis, and undergo metabolism. Option (A) is incorrect because a living thing is not characterized by doing nothing. Option (B) is incorrect because living things are made up of cells, which are small and not inanimate. Option (D) is incorrect because while a large lake of moving water is dynamic, it does not necessarily describe a living thing. Option (C) is the correct answer because it describes the concept of cells working together to form tissues, organs, and ultimately an organism."
