Option (A) moles would be safest from predators in their natural underground habitat. Moles are well adapted to living underground, with their strong digging claws and sensitive snouts allowing them to tunnel through soil and find prey. Being underground provides them with protection from predators like lizards (option B) and eagles (option C), which are adapted for hunting in open spaces and the sky. Sardines (option D) are a type of fish, and while they may have some natural protections in the water, they are not adapted for living underground like moles.

Lizards are terrestrial and can be easily spotted by predators, eagles are aerial predators and have a wide visual range to spot their prey, and sardines are fish that are hunted by larger fish and marine animals.

They have specialized claws and bodies designed for digging and navigating in narrow tunnels. Being underground allows them to hide from predators and avoid being easily detected. Therefore, option (A) is a plausible answer.\n\nLizards, on the other hand, primarily live in above-ground habitats, such as deserts or forests. While some lizards may dig burrows, they are not as well-suited for underground living as moles. Lizards may face predators both on land and from the air, making them less safe than moles. Thus, option (B) is unlikely.\n\nEagles are birds of prey known for hunting in open spaces, primarily in the sky. They have keen eyesight and strong flight capabilities, which enable them to spot and catch their prey. Since they are not adapted for underground living, eagles would not be safe from predators in such habitats. Option (C) is incorrect.\n\nSardines are a type of fish that inhabit ocean waters. They live in schools and use their numbers to confuse predators. While underground habitats could potentially protect them from some marine predators, the question specifies \"natural underground habitat,\" which typically refers to terrestrial environments. Therefore, sardines are unlikely to have a natural underground habitat, making option (D) incorrect.\n\nBy analyzing the characteristics and adaptations of each creature, we can conclude that moles would be the safest from predators in their natural underground habitat, making option (A) the correct answer."

They have strong front limbs and digging capabilities, allowing them to efficiently navigate and create intricate tunnel systems. This makes it difficult for predators to access them underground, providing them with safety from many predators. Therefore, option (A) moles are the safest creature from predators.\n\nLizards, on the other hand, are not specifically adapted to live underground. While they may seek shelter or hibernate in underground burrows, they are not as specialized for underground life as moles. Lizards are more vulnerable to predators and may be easier to access in their underground habitat compared to moles.\n\nEagles are birds of prey that primarily hunt from the air. They are not adapted for underground habitats and lack the physical attributes to access or navigate underground environments. Therefore, option (C) eagles are not safe from predators in underground habitats.\n\nSardines are small fish that primarily live in the open ocean and swim in shoals for protection. They are not adapted for underground habitats and do not possess the necessary adaptations to survive underground. Therefore, option (D) sardines are not safe from predators in underground habitats.\n\nOverall, moles (option A) would be the safest creature from predators in its natural underground habitat due to their specialized adaptations for living underground."
