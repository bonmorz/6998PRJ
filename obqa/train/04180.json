Birds are endothermic animals, meaning they can regulate their body temperature internally and maintain a constant warm blood temperature. Snakes, on the other hand, are ectothermic animals, meaning they rely on external sources, such as the environment, to regulate their body temperature. This makes their blood temperature lower than that of birds. Therefore, option (B) is the correct relationship. Option (A) is incorrect because snakes have cold blood, not warm blood like birds. Option (C) is incorrect because snakes and birds do not have the same type of blood regulation. Option (D) is incorrect because birds have warm blood, not cold blood like snakes."
