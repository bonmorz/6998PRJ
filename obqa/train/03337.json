Porpoises are marine mammals, so they live in saltwater environments such as oceans and seas. Therefore, they are able to move fastest in saltwater. Option (A) is incorrect because dungeons are enclosed spaces and not suitable habitats for porpoises. Option (B) is incorrect because lava is molten rock and not a habitat for any living organisms. Option (C) is incorrect because deserts are dry, arid environments and not suitable habitats for porpoises either."
