It is a skill that is acquired through observation, instruction, and practice. Option (A) is incorrect because predestination implies that scrubbing a toilet is predetermined or fated, which is not the case. Option (B) is incorrect because being innate suggests that one is born with the ability to scrub a toilet, which is not true. Option (C) is incorrect because genetics refers to the hereditary traits passed down from one's ancestors, and scrubbing a toilet is not a genetic trait."

To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of learning and how behaviors are acquired.\n\nScrubbing a toilet is a learned behavior. It is not predestined, meaning it is not predetermined or fated that everyone will know how to scrub a toilet. It is also not innate, meaning it is not something we are born knowing how to do. While certain instincts and reflexes may be innate, toilet scrubbing is not one of them.\n\nScrubbing a toilet is also not genetic. Genetic traits are inherited through DNA and are typically related to physical characteristics or predispositions to certain conditions or diseases. Scrubbing a toilet is a skill that is not passed down through genetics.\n\nInstead, scrubbing a toilet is a learned behavior. It is a skill that is acquired through observation, instruction, practice, and experience. Individuals learn how to properly scrub a toilet by being taught by someone who already knows how to do it, or by observing others or following instructions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) learned."
