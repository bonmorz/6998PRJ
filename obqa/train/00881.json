Animals are controlled by a collection of neurons, which make up their nervous system. Neurons transmit signals and information throughout the body, allowing animals to respond to stimuli and carry out various behaviors. Option (B) is incorrect because animals are not controlled by friends, but rather their own neurological systems. Option (C) is incorrect because weather conditions do not directly control an animal's behavior. Option (D) is incorrect because animals are not controlled by a higher power, but rather by their biological and physiological systems."
