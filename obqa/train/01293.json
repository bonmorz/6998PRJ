As a river flows through an area for a long period of time, it erodes the surrounding rock and soil, creating deep channels or canyons. This is because the force of the flowing water wears away the softer rock and soil, resulting in the formation of larger and deeper channels. Option (B) is incorrect because rivers do not create large bricks. Option (C) is unrelated and not related to the effects of a river. Option (D) is also incorrect because the question states that \"where there once were shallow rivers\" meaning there are no longer shallow rivers, but instead something else."
