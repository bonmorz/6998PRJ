Cold weather can affect a horse's body temperature and prompt a shivering response as a way to generate heat and maintain body temperature. Option (A) is incorrect because it is a subjective and unrelated scenario. Option (C) is also incorrect because getting a movie role does not directly cause a physical response like trembling. Option (D) is unrelated because the sun coming out does not typically cause trembling in horses."
