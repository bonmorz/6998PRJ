A greenhouse is a structure made primarily of glass or other transparent materials that allows sunlight to enter while trapping heat inside. The purpose of a greenhouse is to create a controlled environment for plants to grow, protecting them from external factors that can harm or hinder their growth.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because a greenhouse does not protect plants from nutrients. Nutrients are essential for a plant's growth and development, and they are typically supplied through soil or other growing mediums in the greenhouse.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because a greenhouse is not used to protect plants from socializing. Socializing is a human activity and has no direct impact on the growth or well-being of plants.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because a greenhouse does not prevent fresh air from reaching the plants. While the structure of a greenhouse may limit the airflow compared to an open outdoor environment, it is still designed to allow for air circulation to ensure proper ventilation and prevent excessive heat buildup.\n\nOption (B) is the correct answer. A greenhouse is primarily used to protect plants from freezing winds. By providing a sheltered environment, a greenhouse helps to minimize the impact of cold temperatures, strong winds, and frost on plants. This allows plants to thrive and grow in a more favorable climate-controlled environment."
