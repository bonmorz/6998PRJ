A household appliance that prepares food, such as an oven or a microwave, uses electrical energy to power its operation. In addition to electrical energy, it also utilizes heat energy to cook or heat the food. Option (A) is incorrect because biological energy refers to energy produced by living organisms, which is not relevant to household appliances. Option (B) is incorrect because household appliances do require other forms of energy to operate, such as heat in this case. Option (D) is incorrect because chemical energy refers to energy stored in chemical bonds, which is not directly relevant to the operation of household appliances."

When an appliance uses electrical energy, it can convert that energy into heat energy. Examples of household appliances that use electrical energy to prepare food include ovens, stovetops, and microwave ovens. These appliances convert the electrical energy into heat energy, which then cooks or heats the food. Option (A) is incorrect because biological energy is not involved in the process. Option (B) is incorrect because electrical energy is transformed into heat energy. Option (D) is incorrect because chemical energy is not directly involved in the process."

A household appliance that prepares food typically uses electrical energy to power its functions, such as heating elements or motors. In addition to electrical energy, it also uses heat energy to cook or heat up the food. Heat energy is a common form of energy used in cooking appliances like ovens, stoves, or microwaves. Option (A) is incorrect because biological energy refers to energy produced by living organisms, not typically used in household appliances. Option (B) is also incorrect because appliances require energy to function. Option (D) is not completely incorrect as some appliances may use chemical energy in the form of batteries, but the main energy source for most appliances is electrical energy."
