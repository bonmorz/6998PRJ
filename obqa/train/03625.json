With advances in food transportation, it becomes easier to transport a larger variety of foods to remote areas. This means that people in these areas have a greater selection of food options available to them. Option (A) is incorrect because advances in transportation actually increase variety, not decrease it. Option (B) is incorrect because easier access to a greater variety of food often leads to higher demand.
