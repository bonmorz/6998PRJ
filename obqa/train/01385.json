When a bird, such as a crane, loses weight, it becomes more efficient at flying. This is because a lighter bird requires less energy to stay airborne and can maneuver more easily. Option (A) is incorrect because flying does not affect a bird's height. Option (C) is incorrect because a lighter bird can actually fly faster. Option (D) is incorrect because weight loss does not affect the sound produced by a bird in flight."
