On December 21st, the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted furthest away from the sun, causing the sunrise to be later. As days progress after December 21st, the sunrise will gradually happen earlier until the summer solstice in June. Therefore, if the sunrise is happening earlier than the day before but later than the day after, it must be around December 21st. Option (B) is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because February 21st is after the winter solstice and the sunrise should be getting earlier. Option (C) is incorrect because September 31st does not exist. Option (D) is incorrect because May 21st is before the summer solstice and the sunrise should be getting earlier."

The closer we are to the summer solstice (June 21 in the northern hemisphere), the earlier the sunrise occurs. The closer we are to the winter solstice (December 21 in the northern hemisphere), the later the sunrise occurs. Since the question states that the sunrise is happening earlier than yesterday and later than the day after, it implies that we are moving closer to the winter solstice. The only option that corresponds to this is option (B) - December 21."

So if you wake up north of the equator and notice that the sunrise is happening earlier than yesterday, it means you are in the period after the winter solstice. Option (A), February 21st, is after the winter solstice but the sunrise would be happening even earlier by that point. Option (C), September 31st, is not a valid date as September only has 30 days. Option (D), May 21st, is before the summer solstice so the sunrise wouldn't be happening earlier than yesterday. Therefore, the correct answer is option (B), December 21st, the winter solstice."
