When exposed to cold temperatures, the body tries to maintain its core temperature by increasing heat production. One of the ways it does this is by shivering, which generates heat through muscle contractions. Option (A) is the coldest temperature listed, so it is most likely to cause an animal to shiver. Options (B) and (D) are slightly warmer temperatures, and option (C) is in between, so they are less likely to cause shivering."
