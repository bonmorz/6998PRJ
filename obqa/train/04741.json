Fog is most likely to occur during the late night and early morning hours, around midnight. This is because at this time, the temperature drops, and the air near the surface of the Earth cools, causing the moisture in the air to condense and form fog. Option (A), 3 p.m., is unlikely as the temperature is typically warmer in the afternoon. Option (C), 6 p.m., is also unlikely as the temperature tends to be higher during this time. Option (D), noon, is when the sun is at its highest point in the sky, and the temperature is usually warmer, making fog formation less likely."

Fog is most likely to occur during the early morning hours, around midnight. This is because during this time, the air is usually cooler and close to saturation, which allows water vapor to condense into tiny water droplets and form fog. Option (A), 3 p.m., is generally not a time when fog occurs because the sun is usually at its peak and temperatures are higher. Option (C), 6 p.m., is also less likely as it is often the warmest part of the day. Option (D), noon, is when the sun is usually at its highest point and temperatures are higher, making it less likely for fog to occur. Therefore, option (B), midnight, is the most accurate answer."

This is because at night, the air temperatures tend to cool down and the cooler air cannot hold as much moisture as warmer air.

Option (A) is incorrect because fog is less likely to occur in the afternoon when temperatures are typically warmer.
