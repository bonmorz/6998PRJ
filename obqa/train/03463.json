Warm-blooded animals, also known as endotherms, are able to maintain a constant body temperature regardless of the external environment. Out of the given options, a vulture is warm-blooded because it is capable of regulating its body temperature. Options (A) and (D) are cold-blooded because frogs and lizards cannot regulate their body temperature and rely on external sources of heat. Option (B) is also cold-blooded as snakes are ectotherms, meaning their body temperature depends on the temperature of their environment."
