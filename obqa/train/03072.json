The freezing point refers to the temperature at which a substance, such as water, changes from a liquid state to a solid state. Option (D) is the correct answer because a static ice sculpture represents a substance in its solid state at or below its freezing point. Option (A) is incorrect because waterfalls involve flowing water, which is in its liquid state. Option (B) is also incorrect because flowing rivers are also in their liquid state. Option (C) is incorrect because a glass of water represents water in its liquid state, not its frozen state."
