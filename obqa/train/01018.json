Option (A), rubbing an emery board across your nail, is the correct answer because when you rub the rough surface of an emery board against your nail, small pieces or particles of the nail may break off due to the friction between the two surfaces. Option (B), rubbing a cloth over a counter, is incorrect because it does not involve scraping or friction against a rough surface that would cause particles to break off. Option (C), using a towel after you shower, is incorrect because it does not involve scraping or friction against a rough surface that would cause particles to break off. Option (D), wiping your chin after drinking some milk, is incorrect because it does not involve scraping or friction against a rough surface that would cause particles to break off."
