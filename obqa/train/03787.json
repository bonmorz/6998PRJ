Option (A) is the correct answer because when humans make apartments or buildings, they often destroy natural habitats in order to construct these structures. This can result in animals losing their homes and habitats. Option (B) is incorrect because taking walks does not directly cause animals to lose their habitats. Option (C) is unrelated to the topic as singing songs does not have any direct impact on animal habitats. Option (D) is also incorrect because eating corn does not inherently lead to the loss of animal habitats."
