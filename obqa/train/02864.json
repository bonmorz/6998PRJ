Option (A) is incorrect because if there are fewer animals around, it would not prompt small animals to leave their habitat. Option (B) is also incorrect because if there is too much food available, small animals would not need to leave their habitat in search of it. Option (D) is incorrect because if there is better food available in their current habitat, there would be no need for them to look for new shelter. Option (C) is the correct answer because destruction of their habitat, such as due to natural disasters or human intervention, could force small animals to leave and search for new shelter.
