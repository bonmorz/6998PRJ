Therefore, their habitat is likely to have a significant amount of water. \n\n(B) Crabs are aquatic animals that live in oceans, rivers, and other bodies of water. Their habitat also contains a considerable amount of water. \n\n(C) Cows are domesticated animals and are usually found in areas with access to water, such as farms and pastures. Their habitat is also likely to have a decent amount of water. \n\n(D) Cacti are plants that have adapted to dry desert environments. They are specifically designed to conserve water and can survive in arid conditions. Therefore, their habitat would have the least amount of water compared to the other options. \n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is (D) in the cactus' habitat."
