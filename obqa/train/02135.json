Options (B), (C), and (D) are not considered predators. Moose are herbivores, meaning they only eat plant material. Salmon are also not considered predators as they are primarily prey for other animals. Lobsters are scavengers, meaning they primarily feed on dead or decaying organisms rather than actively hunting and killing other animals."
