An electromagnet is a temporary magnet that is created by passing an electric current through a coil of wire. Option (B), recorders, is the correct answer because recorders contain a coil of wire that becomes magnetized when an electric current is passed through it. Option (A) is incorrect because running has no relation to electromagnetism. Option (C) is incorrect because grass does not have any electromagnetic properties. Option (D) is incorrect because rock climbing does not involve the use of electromagnets."
