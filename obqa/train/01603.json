When a person is lacking a flashlight, they can use mirrors to shuffle sunlight and create a signal. By reflecting sunlight off a mirror and directing it towards the intended person, they can create a signal that is visible from a distance. Option (B), directing sunlight with cones, is incorrect because cones do not have reflective properties. Option (C), directing others with glass, is also incorrect because glass does not have reflective properties necessary for signaling. Option (D), directing shades with hands, is incorrect because hands do not have reflective properties and cannot direct sunlight."
