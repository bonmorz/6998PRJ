Some animals, such as raccoons, are known to be opportunistic eaters and may consume banana peels if they come across them. Option (A), bear, is less likely because bears have a primarily carnivorous diet. Option (C), cat, is also less likely because cats are obligate carnivores and typically do not eat fruits or vegetables. Option (D), dog, may eat banana peels but it is less common compared to raccoons."

Raccoons are opportunistic eaters and are known to eat a variety of foods, including fruits and vegetables. They are often found scavenging in trash cans and may also eat discarded banana peels. Option (A) is incorrect because bears are primarily carnivores and do not typically eat fruits or vegetable waste.
