Option (A) is incorrect because endurance refers to the ability to sustain physical activity, not a source of energy itself. Option (C) refers to the rate of change of position, which can contribute to kinetic energy but is not a source itself. Option (D) is synonymous with velocity, so it is incorrect as well.
