A navigator is typically responsible for providing directions and guiding the movement of a vehicle, such as a car or a ship. Option (A) is incorrect as shoveling a sidewalk is not typically a task performed by a navigator. Option (B) is incorrect as clearing a tree is not typically a task performed by a navigator. Option (D) is incorrect as riding a bike does not typically require the assistance of a navigator. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) conducting a car."
