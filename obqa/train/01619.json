Squids have a unique way of propulsion called jet propulsion, where they draw water into their mantle cavity and forcefully expel it out through a siphon. This rapid expulsion of water creates a force that propels the squid forward. Option (B) is incorrect because the water is not pushed up and below the squid, but rather directly behind it. Option (C) is unrelated to the movement of the squid. Option (D) is also incorrect because the water is not pushed in front of the squid, but rather behind it."
