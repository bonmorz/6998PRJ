Over a long period of time, the Colorado River slowly eroded and carved out the Grand Canyon through a process called erosion. The river water circulates, meaning it flows continuously, wearing away the rock layers and creating the deep, narrow canyon. Option (A) is incorrect because vaporizing refers to the conversion of a substance from liquid to gas, which is not relevant to the formation of the Grand Canyon. Option (B) is also incorrect because evaporating refers to the process of liquid turning into gas, which is not relevant to the formation of the Grand Canyon.
