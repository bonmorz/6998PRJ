Option (A) is correct because the Sahara desert is known for its extremely hot temperatures, often reaching well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Option (B) is incorrect because Minnesota has a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters, but it does not have consistently high temperatures like the Sahara. Option (C) is also incorrect because Alaska has a subarctic climate with long, cold winters and mild summers. Option (D) is incorrect because corpses do not have a fixed temperature and can vary depending on environmental factors."
