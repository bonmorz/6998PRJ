When soil is loose, meaning the particles are not tightly packed together, it creates spaces and air pockets within the soil. This makes it easier for oxygen to enter the soil and reach the roots of plants. Therefore, option (D) - simpler - is the correct answer. Option (A) is unrelated to soil composition. Option (B) is subjective and does not provide any information about the oxygen availability in loose soil. Option (C) is incorrect because loose soil actually makes it easier, not harder, for oxygen to penetrate."
