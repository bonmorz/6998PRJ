Option (C) is the correct answer because sustainable resources are those that can be used over and over again without being depleted, such as solar energy or wind power. Option (A) is incorrect because finite resources are those that exist in limited quantities and cannot be replenished, such as fossil fuels. Option (B) is similar to finite resources, as fuels like oil and coal are finite and will eventually run out. Option (D) is incorrect because \"one use\" resources are those that can only be used once and then become unusable or unusable in the same way, such as single-use plastics."
