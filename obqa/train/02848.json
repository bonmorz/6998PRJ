When a warm potato is left on a steel sink, heat will transfer from the potato to the sink until they are both at the same temperature. This is known as thermal equilibrium. Therefore, the potato will lose heat to the steel sink, option (B), until they reach the same temperature. Option (A) is incorrect because burning would require a significantly higher temperature than the warm potato can reach by simply being on a steel sink. Option (C) and (D) are also incorrect because the potato will not get hotter or warm up further when in contact with the steel sink."

When a warm potato is left on a steel sink, the potato will lose heat to the sink through the process of conduction. Steel is a good conductor of heat, meaning it can efficiently transfer heat from one object to another. As a result, the heat from the potato will be transferred to the sink, causing the potato to cool down. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because the potato will not burn on a steel sink. Option (C) and (D) are also incorrect because the potato will actually cool down rather than get hotter or warm up when in contact with the steel sink."
