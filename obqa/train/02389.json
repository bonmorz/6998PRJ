When an icicle melts or steam condenses, the matter changes from a solid (ice) or a gas (steam) to a liquid state. The word \"dribble\" suggests a liquid dropping in small amounts, which accurately describes the process of melting or condensing. Option (A) is incorrect because singing is not related to changes in matter. Option (B) is incorrect because frying refers to a cooking process involving heat and oil, which is not relevant to the given scenarios.
