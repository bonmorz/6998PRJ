Option (D) is the correct answer because cats, like many other animals, are unable to produce offspring until they reach sexual maturity. This typically occurs during adulthood. Option (A) is incorrect because humans can reproduce once they reach sexual maturity, which can be before they are legally considered adults. Option (B) is incorrect because eggs can be fertilized before they are dropped during ovulation.
