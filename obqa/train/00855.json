Option (A) is incorrect because plants do not need bugs to eat for survival. Option (B) is incorrect because while plants do require water, \"liquid food\" is not an accurate description of their nutritional needs. Option (C) is incorrect because \"finger food\" typically refers to food that is eaten by humans using their fingers, which is not applicable to plants."
