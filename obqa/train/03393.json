Solar pumps are devices that are powered by solar energy and are used to move liquids from one place to another.

They are used on Earth.\n\nOption (B) - Glaciers, is incorrect because solar pumps are not commonly used to move liquids from glaciers. Glaciers are a natural source of water, but solar pumps are used to draw water from sources like wells, rivers, or underground reservoirs.\n\nOption (C) - Sky, is incorrect because solar pumps do not move liquids directly from the sky. They are used to pump from ground-based sources.\n\nOption (D) - Ground, is the correct answer because solar pumps are designed to move liquids from the ground. They can be used to draw water from underground wells or reservoirs, or to pump water from lakes, rivers, or other ground-level water sources.\n\nTherefore, option (D) is the correct answer that best corresponds to the function and purpose of solar pumps."
