Magnetic media, such as TVs, computer monitors, credit cards, and pacemakers, can be damaged when exposed to strong magnetic fields. Neodymium is a type of powerful magnet, and when magnetic media comes in contact with it, it can cause the data stored on the media to become corrupted or erased. Option (B), a paper clip, is incorrect because it is not magnetic enough to cause damage. Option (C), a copper penny, is also incorrect because copper is not magnetic. Option (D), metal nails, are also not necessarily magnetic and would not cause damage unless they were magnetic."
