In order to answer this question, we need to consider the behavior and habits of each animal listed. \n\nOption (A) suggests a fish. Fish typically live in water and do not interact with plants or soil, so they would not be able to help with planting a strawberry. \n\nOption (B) suggests a canary. Canaries are birds, and birds are known to interact with plants and soil. They can pick up seeds and carry them to different locations for planting. So, a canary would be more likely to help ensure the strawberry gets planted. \n\nOption (C) suggests a penguin. Penguins are birds as well, but they do not have the same behavior as canaries. Penguins do not interact with plants or soil in the same way, so they would not be able to help with planting a strawberry. \n\nOption (D) suggests a tiger. Tigers are large predators and do not have any behaviors that would help with planting a strawberry. They are not involved in the dispersal or planting of seeds. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be (B) a canary, as they would be most likely to interact with the strawberry plant and help ensure it gets planted."

Strawberries are flowering plants, and in order for them to reproduce and produce fruits, they rely on pollination.

This transfer can happen through various means, such as wind, water, or animals. However, in the case of strawberries, they rely mostly on animals for pollination. Among the options given, a canary is the most likely to visit a strawberry plant and accidentally transfer pollen, thus helping in the reproduction process.
