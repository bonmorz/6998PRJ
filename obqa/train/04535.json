Salamanders are amphibians that typically live in moist environments, such as forests or near bodies of water. They often seek shelter under objects like rocks, logs, or garden statues to protect themselves from predators and maintain their moisture levels. Option (A) is the most likely choice because it aligns with the natural habitat and behavior of salamanders. Options (B), (C), and (D) are unrelated and not typical locations to find salamanders."
