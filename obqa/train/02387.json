When a shark runs into a thick cloud of ink, it suggests that the ink was released by an octopus. Octopuses are known for their ability to release ink as a defense mechanism, which can create a cloud that can temporarily blind or confuse predators. Option (A) is incorrect because whales do not release ink. Option (B) is also incorrect because sea lions do not have the ability to release ink. Option (D) is incorrect because the question states that the shark is the one being blinded, so it cannot be responsible for releasing the ink."

Option (A) and (B) can be immediately eliminated because whales and sea lions do not have the ability to release ink.
