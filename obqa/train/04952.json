A bulldozer is a heavy machinery commonly used in construction to clear land and level the ground. Skyscrapers, being tall buildings, require a level ground to be built on, so a bulldozer is often used to alter the area by clearing the land and preparing it for construction. The other options are not related to the typical use of a bulldozer. The stock market is a financial market, air is a mixture of gases, and water is a natural resource."

A bulldozer is a construction vehicle used to move and reshape large amounts of earth or debris.

A bulldozer is used to move earth and alter the landscape, typically for construction or clearing purposes. Skyscrapers are tall buildings, so a bulldozer would not directly alter them. The stock market is a financial market and not a physical area that can be altered by a bulldozer. While a bulldozer may stir up dust in the air, it does not directly alter the properties of the air itself. Similarly, a bulldozer may interact with water, but it does not alter water as a whole. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) skyscrapers."
