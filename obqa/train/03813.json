In the arctic in winter, the surroundings are covered in snow and ice, which provides a white background. Rabbits with white fur are adapted to blend in with their surroundings in this environment, making them hard to detect. Option (A) is incorrect because a white rabbit would not be well-camouflaged in a forest in spring, where there is likely to be more green foliage. Option (B) is incorrect because a white rabbit would not blend in well in the middle of a well-lit street, which is likely to have a different color pavement. Option (C) is incorrect because a white rabbit would also not be well-camouflaged in Mexico in the winter, as the country has a more varied landscape and climate."
