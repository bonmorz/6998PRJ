In wolf packs, when a dominant wolf dies, it creates a power vacuum within the pack. Other wolves may then compete to fill the position of the dominant wolf, which can lead to conflicts and potential decreases in the wolf population. Therefore, option (C) is correct - the burial of a wolf can potentially result in less wolves in the pack. Option (A) is unrelated to the burial of a wolf. Option (B) is incorrect as wolves cannot fly. Option (D) is incorrect as the burial of a wolf does not directly lead to an increase in the number of wolves."
