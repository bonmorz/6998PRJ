Water evaporates less in a basement because basements tend to be cooler and have higher humidity levels, which slows down the evaporation process. Option (A) is incorrect because water evaporates faster on a hot street due to higher temperatures.

When water is in a basement, it is typically cooler and has less airflow compared to other areas. This means that there is less heat and exposure to dry air, which are both factors that promote evaporation. Therefore, water evaporates less in a basement. Option (A) is incorrect because a hot street provides heat and dry air, which would promote evaporation. Option (C) is incorrect because a sunny day provides heat and dry air, which would also promote evaporation. Option (D) is incorrect because being next to a window does not significantly affect the rate of evaporation."

Water evaporates less in a basement because basements tend to be cooler and have lower temperatures than the outside environment. Evaporation occurs when water molecules gain enough energy to escape into the atmosphere as vapor. In a hot street (option A), the high temperature increases the evaporation rate. On a sunny day (option C), the sunlight also provides heat energy, increasing the likelihood of evaporation. Next to a window (option D), the heat from the sun can still reach the water and increase evaporation.
