When dead leaves fall from a tree and hit the ground, they often make a crunching sound. This sound is consistent with someone walking under a tree and hearing a crunching sound. Option (B) is unlikely because the sound of a mouse running away would not typically produce a crunching noise. Option (C) is unlikely because the sound of a duck quacking is different from a crunching sound. Option (D) is unlikely because the sound of a dog barking is different from a crunching sound. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that dead leaves fell from the tree, causing the crunching sound."
