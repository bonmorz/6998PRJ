Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a form of sugar) and oxygen. Option (A), roses, is correct because they are plants and are capable of photosynthesis. Option (B), deer, is incorrect because deer are animals and cannot perform photosynthesis. Option (C), rainbows, is incorrect because rainbows are optical phenomena that occur due to the refraction, reflection, and dispersion of light. They are not living organisms and cannot perform photosynthesis. Option (D), water buffalo, is incorrect because water buffalo are animals and, like deer, cannot perform photosynthesis."
