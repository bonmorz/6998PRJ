Prehistoric living things, such as plants and animals, were transformed into natural gas through a process called burial and decomposition. As these organisms were buried under layers of sediment over millions of years, heat and pressure caused the organic material to undergo chemical changes and eventually form natural gas. Option (D) is the correct answer because volcanic reactions can contribute to the heat and pressure necessary for this transformation. Options (A), (B), and (C) are not directly related to the formation of natural gas."

Option (A) is incorrect because air currents do not have the same effects as heat and pressure. Option (B) is incorrect because fire does not play a role in the formation of natural gas.

Natural gas is formed when the remains of prehistoric living things, such as plants and animals, are exposed to heat and pressure deep within the Earth over millions of years. This process is known as fossil fuel formation.\n\nOption (D) states that volcanic reactions likely changed the remains of prehistoric living things into natural gas. This is the correct answer because volcanic activity can generate intense heat and pressure that can contribute to the formation of natural gas. Volcanic reactions can release magma, which contains high amounts of heat and pressure. This heat and pressure can then facilitate the conversion of organic matter into natural gas.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because air currents alone do not have the ability to convert organic matter into natural gas. Option (B) is also incorrect because fire, although it releases heat, does not occur naturally deep within the Earth where natural gas is formed. Option (C), thunder, is also incorrect because thunder is a sound caused by lightning and does not have the ability to change organic matter into natural gas."
