Option (A) a camera bag is incorrect because it is used for carrying and storing camera equipment, not for actually recording. Option (C) a Nikon lens is also incorrect because a lens is only one component of a camera and cannot record a live game on its own. Option (D) a camera flash is also incorrect because it is used for providing additional light when taking photos, not for recording video. The correct answer is (B) a GoPro, which is a popular camera specifically designed for capturing action and sports footage. It is portable and can be easily mounted on various surfaces to capture a basketball game from different angles."
