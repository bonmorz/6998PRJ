One of the principles of genetics is that traits are inherited from parents through the passing of genes. Eye color is a trait that is determined by genes, so the couple can use a chart or punnett square to calculate the likelihood of the child sharing the same eye color as the mother and father. Option (B) is unrelated and not a scientific method for determining eye color. Option (C) is unrelated and not a scientific method for determining eye color. Option (D) is incorrect because injecting a dye would not determine the child's eye color."
