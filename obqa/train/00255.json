When you breathe out, especially in the vicinity of clear glass, you may witness your breath beading up. This is because your breath contains warm, moist air. When it hits the cold surface of the glass, the air cools down and loses its ability to hold moisture. As a result, the moisture in your breath condenses and forms tiny droplets on the glass, creating the beads. Option (A) is incorrect because breath is a mixture of gases, not solely air. Option (B) is incorrect because the dryness or moisture of your breath does not change when it condenses on the glass. Option (D) is unrelated to the phenomenon being described."
