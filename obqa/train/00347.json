The size of a person's shadow is determined by the angle at which the sunlight hits the person and the length of the person's body.\n\nAt 8:00 am and 6:30 pm, the sun is at a lower angle in the sky, which means the shadows will be longer. Therefore, options (B) and (D) can be eliminated.\n\nAt 4:00 pm, the sun is starting to descend, so the shadows will be longer compared to noon. Therefore, option (A) can be eliminated.\n\nAt 12:30 pm, the sun is at its highest point in the sky (assuming a standard time zone). This means that the sunlight is coming from directly above, causing objects to have very short or almost non-existent shadows. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer.\n\nIn summary, a person's shadow is smallest at 12:30 pm because the sun is directly overhead, creating minimal shadows."
