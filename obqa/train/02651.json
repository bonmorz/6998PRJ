To answer this question, we need to understand the properties of different materials in terms of their ability to conduct heat.\n\nOption (A) states that a penny could be an example of a thermal conductor. This is the correct answer because metals, like copper which is used in pennies, are excellent thermal conductors. They have high thermal conductivity, which means that heat can move through them quickly and easily.\n\nOption (B) suggests that grass could be an example of a thermal conductor. Grass, however, is not a good thermal conductor. It is made up of mostly water and organic matter, and these materials tend to be poor conductors of heat.\n\nOption (C) states that a wood block could be an example of a thermal conductor. Wood is a poor thermal conductor. It is a natural insulator, which means it does not allow heat to flow through it easily.\n\nOption (D) suggests that cotton could be an example of a thermal conductor. Cotton is another example of a poor thermal conductor. It is a natural insulator and does not allow heat to pass through it easily.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) a penny, because metals like copper have high thermal conductivity and allow heat to flow through them easily."
