Bees are alive and they move from flower to flower, carrying pollen and facilitating the transfer of pollen from the male parts of a flower to the female parts, leading to fertilization and reproduction. Option (B) is incorrect because rocks are not alive and cannot pollinate. Option (C) is incorrect because trees are not pollinators themselves, although they can produce flowers and rely on pollinators like bees for their reproduction.
