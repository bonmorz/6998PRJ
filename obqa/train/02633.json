A salamander is a type of amphibian, and most amphibians (including salamanders) are cold-blooded. This means that their body temperature fluctuates with the temperature of their environment. Option (A) is incorrect because salamanders are not extinct. Option (B) is incorrect because salamanders typically have four legs and are not bipedal.
