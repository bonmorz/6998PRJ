Option (A) is incorrect because pollination is the transfer of pollen, which is not derived from soil, and germination is the process of a seed developing into a plant, which also does not involve deriving from soil. Option (C) is incorrect because roots are part of the plant itself and are not derived from the soil. While plants do release oxygen into the soil, they do not derive oxygen from the soil.
