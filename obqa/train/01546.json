Changing even something small in an environment can have a significant impact on the entire ecosystem, potentially causing it to become imbalanced or unable to support certain species. Option (A) is the correct answer because changing the rainforest, even in a small way, can disrupt the delicate balance of the ecosystem and lead to its destruction. Options (B) and (C) are personifying the environment, which is not accurate. Option (D) is incorrect because any change in the environment will have some sort of effect, even if it is not immediately obvious."
