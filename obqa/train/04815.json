Loam is a type of soil that is a mixture of sand, silt, and clay, and it is commonly found near riverbanks due to the deposition of sediments by the flowing water. Option (A) is incorrect because a riverbank may have animals living around it, but it is not made of animals. Option (B) is incorrect because a riverbank is not made of oceans.
