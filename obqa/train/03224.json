An electron microscope is a microscope that uses a beam of electrons instead of light to magnify objects. It is commonly used to study very small objects or structures, such as cells, viruses, and bacteria. Option (A) is incorrect because emotions cannot be physically examined with a microscope. Option (B) is incorrect because an elephant is too large to be observed with an electron microscope. Option (C) is incorrect for the same reason as option (B). Therefore, the correct answer is (D) my common cold, as a common cold is caused by a virus that can be observed under an electron microscope."
