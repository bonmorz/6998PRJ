A renewable resource is a natural resource that can be replenished or replaced over time, such as wind, sunlight, or rain. Option (A) is incorrect because plastic is derived from non-renewable resources like petroleum. Option (B) is incorrect because metal is also derived from non-renewable resources like ores. Option (C) is incorrect because concrete is made from non-renewable resources like limestone and clay. Option (D) is the correct answer because rain is part of the Earth's water cycle and is constantly replenished through evaporation and condensation."

A renewable resource is a resource that can be replenished or replaced naturally over a relatively short period of time. Option (D) correctly identifies \"rain\" as a renewable resource because rainfall is part of the Earth's water cycle. Water evaporates from bodies of water, condenses in the atmosphere, and falls back to the Earth as rain. This process is ongoing and replenishes the Earth's water supply. Options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because plastic, metal, and concrete are not naturally renewable resources.
