The stars appear in different areas in the sky at different times of the year due to the Earth's rotation. As the Earth rotates on its axis, different parts of the sky come into view from different locations on Earth. This is why we see different constellations and stars at different times of the year. Option (B) is incorrect because changing weather does not affect the position of stars in the sky. Option (C) is incorrect because the sun's rotation does not directly affect the position of stars. Option (D) is incorrect because time change, which refers to daylight saving time, is a man-made adjustment of clocks and does not affect the actual position of stars in the sky."
