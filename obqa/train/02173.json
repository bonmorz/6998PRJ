Option (B) is incorrect because the presence of ducks does not directly impact the volume of water in the pond.

During a storm, rainwater can fall into the pond, adding to its volume. This is a common occurrence, especially in areas with heavy rainfall or during periods of intense precipitation. Therefore, option (D) is the best choice for an answer."
