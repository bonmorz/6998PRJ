When the mouse tries to climb up the fence and touches it, it will receive an electric shock. Electric shocks can be harmful or even fatal to small animals like mice.

Option (A) and (B) can be ruled out because the mouse is likely to learn from the negative experience and avoid climbing the fence again. Option (D) is not supported by any evidence and is not a logical outcome in this situation."
