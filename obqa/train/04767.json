Cooking food at high temperatures kills bacteria and other harmful microorganisms that can cause foodborne illnesses. Option (A), spoiled food, is incorrect because spoiled food can cause food poisoning. Option (C), food that has been defecated on, is also incorrect as it can introduce harmful bacteria. Option (D), rotted food, is also incorrect as it can contain harmful bacteria and toxins. Therefore, the correct answer is option (B), fully cooked."
