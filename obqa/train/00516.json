A higher barometer reading indicates greater air pressure in the atmosphere. Air pressure is the force exerted by the weight of the air molecules above a certain point, and a higher pressure means a greater force being exerted. Option (A) is incorrect because a higher barometer reading corresponds to higher air pressure, not lower. Option (B) is incorrect because an atmosphere lacking in air pressure would be a vacuum. Option (D) is incorrect because a broken barometer would not give accurate readings, but a higher reading itself does not indicate that the barometer is broken."
