When Bobby pushes the button with the picture of a cow on it, the toy makes a mooing noise. This indicates that a circuit is being completed when the button is pressed, allowing the toy to generate the sound. Option (A) is incorrect because pressing the button would actually close the circuit, not open it. Option (B) is incorrect and unrelated to how the toy works. Option (C) is incorrect because it implies that there is a live cow inside the toy, which is unlikely and not how the toy is designed to make the sound. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) because pressing the button makes a circuit intact, allowing the toy to make the mooing noise."
