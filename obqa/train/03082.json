Option (A) states that something from space entered the atmosphere, which is a possible explanation for a large hole shaped like a ball. Objects like meteoroids or other space debris can enter Earth's atmosphere and create impact craters. This option aligns with the shape of the hole and the fact that it is found in the desert, which often has open skies for objects to enter the atmosphere. \n\nOption (B) suggesting a lizard built the hole is highly unlikely as lizards do not have the physical capabilities to create such a large hole. Option (C) proposing the moon's gravity pulling sand out of the hole does not make sense because the moon's gravity would not affect the sand in such a way. Additionally, if the sand was pulled out, we would expect to see an indentation rather than a hole. Option (D) proposing a dust storm filling the hole also does not align with the given information as the hole is described as being shaped like a ball had hit it, not filled in. \n\nTherefore, option (A) is the most reasonable and logical explanation given the information provided."
