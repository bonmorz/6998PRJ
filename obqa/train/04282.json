Marconi is credited with inventing the radio, which is commonly used to pass information from one person to another through broadcasting and communication. Newton is known for his contributions to physics and mathematics and did not invent a device specifically for passing information between people. McCormick is known for inventing the mechanical reaper, a farming implement, which is not used for passing information. Pasteur is known for his discoveries in microbiology, including the process of pasteurization, which is not directly related to passing information between people. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) an invention by Marconi."
