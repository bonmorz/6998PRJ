The statement in the question suggests that the Earth loses a million parts of energy each day. In order to maintain equilibrium, the Earth needs to gain an equal amount of energy. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) it gains more. Option (A) is incorrect because it suggests that the Earth loses more energy than it gains, which would lead to an overall energy deficit. Option (B) is also incorrect because it suggests that the Earth has less energy, which contradicts the statement in the question. Option (D) is unrelated to the concept of energy balance and is not a valid answer choice."

The statement says that the Earth may lose a million parts of energy each day, implying that the Earth is losing energy. From the options provided, option (C) correctly states that the Earth gains more energy. This is because the Earth receives energy from the sun through radiation, which is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, land, and oceans. This input of energy from the sun compensates for the energy lost by the Earth, allowing it to maintain its overall energy balance. Option (A) is incorrect because it states that the Earth loses more energy, which contradicts the information given. Option (B) is incorrect because it states that the Earth has less energy, which also contradicts the information given. Option (D) is unrelated, as it describes the texture or physical state of the Earth, which is not relevant to the energy transfer."
