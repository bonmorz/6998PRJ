If a tootsie roll has visible kinetic energy, it is likely sliding sideways because this motion would be observable.

Option (B) is irrelevant because whether the tootsie roll is wrapped up or not does not determine its kinetic energy. Option (D) is also incorrect because being frozen would actually reduce the tootsie roll's kinetic energy."
