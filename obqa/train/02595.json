During photosynthesis, trees use sunlight, along with water and carbon dioxide, to produce energy in the form of glucose. This energy is used by the tree for growth and other metabolic processes. Option (A) is incorrect because roots are involved in absorbing water and nutrients, not sunlight. Option (B) is unrelated to photosynthesis. Option (C) is unrelated to the process of using sunlight.
