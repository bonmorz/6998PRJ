They break down organic matter, such as dead squirrels, through the process of decomposition. This decomposition breaks down the material and helps to aerate the soil, making it easier for water and nutrients to penetrate. Therefore, a small pile of worms can pull apart the yard of dirt with dead squirrels in it. The other options are not related to the activities of worms or the effects they have on soil. Option (A) is unlikely and unrelated to worms. Option (B) is not a common outcome of worms on soil. Option (D) is unrealistic as worms do not have the ability to set things on fire."
