White blood cells are responsible for fighting off infections and diseases in our bodies. If a person has weak white blood cells, it means that their immune system is compromised and they are more susceptible to getting sick. Therefore, option (C) - a person with a weak white blood cell would be the most susceptible to disease. Options (A), (B), and (D) all imply that the individuals mentioned are healthy and in good condition, which would make them less susceptible to disease."

This is incorrect because even with healthy white blood cells, a person can still be susceptible to disease depending on other factors such as exposure to pathogens or weakened immune system.\n\nOption (B) states that a person with optimal conditions would be least susceptible to disease. This is also incorrect because optimal conditions do not guarantee immunity against diseases. Factors such as exposure to pathogens and overall health can still play a role in susceptibility to disease.\n\nOption (C) states that a person with a weak white blood cell would be most susceptible to disease. This is the correct answer because if the white blood cells are weak or not functioning properly, the body's immune system will be compromised and less able to fight off infections and diseases.\n\nOption (D) states that an athlete with a clean bill of health would be least susceptible to disease. While being physically fit and healthy can improve overall immune function, it does not guarantee complete immunity. Being an athlete may reduce the risk of certain diseases, but it does not eliminate the possibility of contracting diseases altogether. Therefore, this option is incorrect."
