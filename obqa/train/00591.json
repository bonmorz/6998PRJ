Phase changing occurs when a substance transitions from one state to another, such as from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas. In this case, option (C) is the correct answer because refrigerating jello mix causes it to transition from a liquid state to a solid state, forming jello. None of the other options involve phase changes: option (A) is pouring water into a different container, option (B) is merely allowing a cake to cool, and option (D) is slicing a turkey."
