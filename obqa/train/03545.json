When watering holes dry up, animals lose their water source, which can lead to dehydration, starvation, and an increased risk of predation. Option (A) is the correct answer because some animals will inevitably die due to the lack of water. Option (B) is incorrect because animals are more likely to move away from the area in search of water sources rather than move into the drying watering hole. Option (C) is subjective and not necessarily true in all cases. Option (D) is incorrect because animals are not capable of digging wells."
