        "First, we need to understand what a three-month period (Answer: A) is. A three-month period is a season that occurs every winter season. Now, let's define what a three-month period is. Clearly, \"three-month period\" refers to the period of approximately three months, typically starting on December 21st and ending on March 20th. So, let's assume for a three-month period. So, would we start on December 21st and end on March 20th? The answer is no, as we do not need to know whether there is a specific day or month on the calendar to have a three-month period for a full calendar year. However, we need to consider if the two definitions overlap or overlap. It's important to consider these two definitions in the context of the question. December 21st is the beginning of autumn in December, and February is the end of February in March, and March is the final day of spring. While the season of spring is not defined on the calendar, it is likely associated with a different season. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) A). Answer: A",
        "First, we need to define what Christmas is. Christmas is a traditional season from December to April in many nations. Next, we need to consider when the winter starts in December in North America. During the winter, the temperatures increase slightly throughout the year. Based on this information, we can conclude that December 21st through March 20st is a three month period which is an example of a winter period. This is because Christmas dates are a significant shortened time period, which means that Christmas is not celebrated immediately after December 21st. Thus, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to determine when a three month period, known as the equinox, is. This means it is between December 21, 21, and March 20, 20. Next, we need to understand what the month is called when the phrase \"As of 1 October\" is used. This is sometimes referred to as the winter period, where it starts on December 22, so there is typically at least three months equinoxed every other month in the winter season. This interval can usually be longer, as the equinox moves away from the winter season. Based on this information, we can conclude that December 21st through March 20 is an example of a three month period, which is an example of the equinoxed period, which is between December 21, 21st, and March 20, 20th. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) (B) (C) - December 21st - March 20th. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to define what a three month period is. A three month period is typically considered to be a continuous period of a long period of time during the fall season. Next, we need to define what it means to have a session. We are not necessarily in the middle of winter. However, it is important to note that it would be difficult to find a sitting for a session, given the time frame of the question. In this case, it is important to ask if it is possible for you to have a four-day session to have an opportunity to think about things in the morning and fall. Given these definitions, we can guess that if we are referring to a three-month period (which is usually a three-month period), it is possible that a session could be held on a different day of the week or a different week of the month. Taking all of these pieces of information to an extreme, we can safely assume that the answer is yes. However, to answer this question, we need to use a different definition for some common themes such as spring, autumn, and summer. When is a three-month period (December 21st through March 20) usually considered an example of a three-month period? The correct answer is the following, September 21st through March 20 (a three-month period is usually considered a three-month period). Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand the definition of the term \"seay period.\" In the western United States, it may refer to the winter period in which there is a winter solstice and the end at March 20. However, this is not a specific term, as the term refers to a range of months, including months of June or July in North America, and the winter season. So, the question is asking whether December 21st through March 20 is an example of a summer period or not. December 21st through March 20 is the period of time from which spring begins to fall, which begins on December 21st and ends on March 20. Therefore, we need to determine the question's definition of the term. Answer: A"

        "2017\u201318 North American winter . The 2017\u201318 North American winter refers to winter in North America as it occurred across the continent from late 2017 through early 2018. While there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used. Based on the astronomical definition, winter began at the winter solstice, which in 2017 occurred on December\u00a021, and ends at the March equinox, which in 2018 occurred on March\u00a020. Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter is December\u00a01 and the last day February\u00a028.<ref name=\"NOAA/NWS-Seasons\"></ref> Each definition involves a period of approximately three months, with some variability with both definitions containing two months and a week. Winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures. Since both definitions span the calendar year, it is possible to have a winter storm in two different years."
