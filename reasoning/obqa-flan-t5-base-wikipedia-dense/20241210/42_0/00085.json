        "First, we need to understand what a cheetah is. A cheetah is a large mammal that is native to Africa, specifically the deserts of Africa, Asia, and Africa. Next, we need to consider the characteristics of the habitat that a cheetah would have if it were protected. If it were protected, it could survive an attack by humans, including cheetahs. Based on this information, we can infer that a cheetah would have a difficult time finding prey due to their lack of habitat and environment. However, we can assume that the time it would have taken to find the prey would have significantly greater than the population of a cheetah. Thus, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define what \"losing all day\" means. When a cheetah runs for a long time, they will typically find that it has lost some type of prey. This means they are snorting at certain times of the day, but not so much as they move away for fear of being eaten by predators. Therefore, cheetah running for a long time may find it to have lost a lot of prey. Thus, the correct answer is (A) - not losing all day - is what happens if a cheetah runs all day, it will find it has lost too much. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to understand what a cheetah is. Cheetahs are wild animals that hunt small prey species, usually from the wild to the mountains. Next, we need to know what prey is a cheetah looking for. A cheetah looking for food needs to hunt for prey. Finally, we need to consider what prey animals cheetahs often seek. It's important to note that cheetahs are known for their speed and speed, which can be highly a factor in cheetahs. In this case, the cheetah can run for long periods, and the prey will lose much of its blood and urine in these short days. So, the answer is yes, a cheetah that runs all day will find it has lost a lot of blood and blood. Hence, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, it is important to understand that cheetahs are predatory animals that prefer to hunt prey. Based on this, we can infer that the question is asking whether a cheetah has lost a lot of nutrients. Prey is a crucial component of a cheetah's diet. Next, we need to consider what predators are chasing or hunting when a cheetah runs all day. Based on a recent study, we can conclude that cheetahs are known for being herbivorous, which means they have a unique diet consisting of herbivores, which ocurtails primarily in the wild. This means that cheetahs have been able to find a lot of prey and have used them up a bit on land and in small numbers. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand the role of a cheetah. A cheetah is a carnivorous mammal that primarily lives in subsistences where it hunts prey. It is known to have a high body weight, typically between 2 and 3 ounces. However, it is not a reliable measure of food. The same goes for prey. Therefore, running all day is not a necessary measure of a cheetah's nutritional needs. It's important to identify the cheetah's nutritional needs and prioritize them. So, let's look at their diets to determine if a cheetah that runs all day can find that it has lost some of its nutritional needs. In general, a cheetah's diet depends on a number of factors, including its size, weight, and the environment in which it is found. While it does have a special diet for the cheetah, it does not prioritize prey and keeps on being hunted to get the best feed on its target. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, cheetahs do not only run all day, they also hunt small mammals such as kangaroos, walruses, and other small mammals. Answer: B"

        "Cheetah . The cheetah is a carnivore that prefers medium-sized prey with a body mass ranging from . Blesbok, duiker, Grant's gazelle, impala, reedbuck, springbok, and Thomson's gazelle are some of the common targets of the cheetah. Other prey animals include the bat-eared fox, bushbuck, kudu, hartebeest, nyala, oribi, roan antelope, steenbok, sable antelope, and waterbuck; they prey less frequently on the African buffalo, gemsbok, giraffe, ostrich, warthog, wildebeest, and zebra. A study showed that a major proportion of the diet of Asiatic cheetahs consists of livestock; local species such as chinkara, desert hare, goitered gazelle, ibex, rodents, and wild sheep are also hunted. Generally, only groups of cheetahs will attempt to kill large animals such as hartebeest, although mothers with young cubs will attempt to secure a large prey all by themselves. There are no records of cheetah killing human beings. The diet of a cheetah depends on the area in which it lives. For example, on the East African plains, its preferred prey is the Thomson's gazelle, somewhat smaller than the cheetah. In contrast, in Kwa-Zulu Natal the preferred prey is the significantly larger nyala, males of which can weigh up to . They do, however, opt for young and adolescent targets, which make up about 50% of the cheetah diet despite constituting only a small portion of the prey population. Cheetahs hunt primarily throughout the day, but geographical variations exist. For instance, cheetahs in the Sahara and the Masai Mara hunt after sunset to escape the high temperatures of the day. In the Serengeti they hunt when the lions and hyenas are inactive. A study in Nairobi National Park in Kenya showed that the success of the hunt depends on the species, age, sex, and habitat of the prey, and the size of the hunting herd or the efficiency of the hunting individual. Cheetahs hunt by vision rather than by scent. Prey is located from observation points or while roaming. Animals toward the edges of the herd are preferred. The cheetah will stalk their prey to within ; it will try to approach it as closely as possible while concealing itself in cover, sometimes even up to within of the prey. The cheetah will crouch and move slowly while stalking, occasionally becoming motionless. The chase usually lasts less than a minute; if the cheetah fails to make a kill quickly, it will give up. Cheetahs have an average hunting success rate of 40 to 50%."
