        "First, we need to understand what resistance means. Resistance is the force exerted by a plant when it receives a necessary or sufficient amount of force. It refers to the resistance of plant structure to be pulled out of the ground when it is unable to withstand the force exerted. Next, we need to understand what resistance is. Resistance is a measure of the strength or strength of a substance when it is applied to it. Now, when we try to pull a rose out of the ground, we encounter resistance. In order to do so, we need to be able to determine the correct and optimized level of resistance in the plant. To do this, we need to know if the plant has been sufficiently submerged in water or other nutrient. So, the plant has been being gently pulled out of the ground. While it is not the maximum resistance of the plant, it is a good idea to do so with the specific plant needs to be pulled out to the ground. For example, if the plant is submerged in water and requires to receive a sufficient amount of force to lift it out, it will likely be stronger than the plant being pulled out. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, as it is not the object but a plant being pulled out from the ground. Answer: A",
        "- When a plant is trying to pull out its roots, they do not have the strength or resistance to do so. - They have a lack of structure or resistance to fall or slope. - Therefore, when pulling a rose out of the ground, you only need to pull it out of the ground if you are using the same technique. - The root itself is weak, but it has a stronger and stronger resistance. - Thus, the answer is (B) resistance. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, we need to understand what resistance is. Resistance is how strong a material is when it pushed out of the ground. So, in terms of pull out resistance, the answer is typically tensile strength. If tensile strength is high, then it's important to consider the relative force of the nut and stem that's being pulled out of the ground. In the case of a rose, tensile strength is a measure of the distance a stem has to pull out of. For example, if the length of a rose's root is shorter than the diameter of the nut, the strength of the nut's root is greater. Similarly, if the stem's resistance is more than the width of the nut, the resistance of the roots is equal to or greater than the length of the stem's root. The resistance of the nut varies from root to root. Since tensile strength can vary depending on the size of the nut, it's important to look at different properties of the nut and root. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, the question asks if there is resistance to pull a rose out of the ground. The answer is \"yes,\" but in one sense it means there is some resistance to be gained or gained. Next, the question asks if there is any reason to gain resistance. This is because it could be related to the plant's growth, such as the root structure or other physical characteristics of the plant. Given the context, it's likely that you'd get some resistance from the roots of the plant, as it can be the most difficult thing to lift. In this case, there is a plant in which a rose is placed, which can be an unbalanced force that allows for a rose to emerge and root out of the ground, such that it can cause the roots to break apart and become tangled and break apart. Therefore, the answer to the question is likely to be resistance based on the type and quality of the plant that you are trying to pull it out of. Therefore, the correct answer is (A): if a rose is having a resistance to pull out from the ground, it can be tame or debilitate it to survive. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, pulling a rose requires some resistance. Typically, it means that the plant is strong enough to pull it out of the ground. Finally, the resistance of the plant is measured by the rate at which it moves with force. If the plant is strong enough to hold on its roots for a long period of time, it will make the root hard, but it will only grow for a short period of time. Given this reasoning, the answer is \"yes\" or \"no\" depending on the specific plant or soil type. Answer: A"

        "Vegetation and slope stability . The pull out resistance of a root is the measured resistance of root structure to be pulled out of the ground and is likely to be only a little less than the measured tensile strength of the root which is the roots resistance to breaking as measured in the laboratory. In the cases where there is no pull out data available the tensile strength data maybe used as a rough guide to the maximum pull out resistance available."
