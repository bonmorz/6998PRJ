        "First, we need to understand what \"banging on a drum causes A\" is referring to the sound produced by vibration or vibrations of the drum itself. This implies that the music is being reverberated and loud, with loud notes, sounded by musicians, or by blowing them from the headphones. Next, we need to understand what noises cause an ear drum. An eardrum ruptures is a large analgetic cavity in the eardrum, which can be irritated with various noises and loud sounds. This irritance can cause an issue with the eardrum or any other part of the ear. Now, to answer the question, \"Doing on a drum causes A\" or \"B\" represents loud, loud noises. The vibrations from the drum, also known as harmonic distortion, often occur due to a type of musical instrument, such as the guitar, or drums. These vibrations are caused by vibrations and vibrations caused by vibrations in the eardrum. Therefore, the answer is (A) \u2013 that if a loud, loud noise sounds are being reproduced by a drum, the vibrations caused by the drum are irritated and could cause an eardrum to rupture. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what a drum is. A drum is a drum that vibrates sound, often for reasons such as roaring and screaming. Next, we need to consider the purpose of a certain song or sound. Banging on a drum can cause a loud noise that rings the eardrum. So, drumming on a drum can cause the eardrum to vibrate, causing a loud and aggressive sound, especially when it is played in an outdoor environment. Therefore, it is worth taking a time out of your day to consider the various ways to manipulate the sound and the outcome can help. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what a drum can be used to make music. On the other hand, drums can be used for a variety of purposes such as a drum solo, concert band, or for playing electronic instruments. Now, we need to understand what a drum is. A drum is a musical instrument that vibrates and arouses the eardrum. It can have a high pitch, which is generally seen in some type of music. Now, we can answer the question. Banging on a drum is a form of music that can be difficult to hear and loud, because it often creates a loud sound, with a loud octave. However, if playing drums are not allowed to make noise, it can cause the sound to be distorted or damaged. When a drum is played loudly, the octave sounds in the eardrum can lead to causing serious harm to the eardrum. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) it can cause a loud, irritating sound that is not based on the drum. Answer: A",
        "1. Firstly, it is important to understand what is meant by \"bang on a drum\". Secondly, a drum is a large musical instrument made of carbon metal or wood. Its sound is loud, especially if hitting something hard or blowing it is on it. 3. When a musician hits a drum, it causes vibrations inside his eardrum to trigger the eardrum. This can lead to a variety of injuries, including audible or irritated or disoriented eardrums, paralysis, or a number of other health conditions. 4. Next, we need to understand the meaning of \"banging on a drum.\" This is the sound of sound hitting a drum in the air without causing any damage to the eardrum. 5. In order for music to be loud, a particular sound must not be perceived as being very different or aggressive than a normal noise. This sound may be interpreted as \"all the same\" or a \"pork\" sound. 6. Considering the meaning of \"bang on a drum\", we can see that there is a potential for a potential for loss of hearing or damage to the eardrum, or for the noise to be made. So, in conclusion, the answer to the question is (A) loud, and there is a potential for loss of sound. Answer: A",
        "A drum is often played with a loud sound. Therefore, a drum is used to produce high-frequency noise and sound. In other words, drums make noise when they vibrate. Therefore, it is safe to say that a drum playing on a drum has high-frequency noise. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) - music to be loud. It is important to note that some musical instruments, such as guitars or saphones, can cause low-frequency noise, resulting in a loud and intense sound. Secondly, noises can also cause a problem with the eardrum when a drum is played. To fix this, we need to experiment with different eardrum effects. To do this, we can create an effect called \"Banging On a Drum\" (sangular saphones). The effect can last for several years or months, depending on the desired effect and the exact response of each musical instrument. To see if a noticeable response can occur, use a resonator like a symphony or a keyboard. Alternatively, with the assistance of an external speaker like an assistant or a vocalist, there can be a more gentle vibration of the eardrum. Therefore, to determine the correct answer to the question, we need to determine whether the result of a loud noise on a drum causes significant harm to the eardrum. In summary, based on the above-mentioned methods, the correct answer is (A) - music to be loud. Answer: A"

        "Perforated eardrum . A perforated eardrum or punctured eardrum is a rupture or perforation (hole) of the eardrum which can occur as a result of otitis media (ear infection), trauma (e.g. by trying to clean the ear with sharp instruments), explosion, loud noise or surgery (accidental creation of a rupture). Flying with a severe cold can also cause perforation due to changes in air pressure and blocked eustachian tubes resulting from the cold. This is especially true on landing. Perforation of the eardrum leads to conductive hearing loss, which is usually temporary. Other symptoms may include tinnitus, earache or a discharge of mucus. Throwing up or nausea may occur."
