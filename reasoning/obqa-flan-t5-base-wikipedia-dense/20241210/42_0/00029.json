        "Firstly, when a plane is flying, there is no friction between the A and the A, both of which are externally located. This means that when the plane is in flight, the A is directly pressed against the surface of the ground, which is the earth's surface and is generally quiet. Secondly, when it's flying, the A, a liquid, is the liquid in the air that makes it difficult to move on its own. This means that the liquid is not frictional, making the air that we are fucking into. Instead of friction, the A's are rubbing together, causing the fluid to slip, and creating friction between them. So, in the case of flying, a plane is unlikely to have any friction between the A and its A. This is because the friction between the A and B can be caused by different factors like weather, air terrain, and distance. Therefore, based on these, we can conclude that when a plane is flying, it is indeed flying without friction. There are some other aspects of flight that may be problematic to a certain type of flight. For example, the air will make it harder to keep track of the A while flying, because the flutter is not directly pressed against the surface of the ground and is often distorted, resulting in a loss of air energy. In this scenario, the pressure that the plane is forced to press towards the ground would change the shape of the plane. Lastly, the air flow would still be blowing more air and likely to cause friction between the A and B. This would require additional effort and effort, without damaging the plane as the plane is moving at a rate. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to understand the purpose of friction. Friction refers to one of the forces required to maintain flight speed, such as the tilt, traction, direction, or movement of the aircraft or instrument. Next, we need to consider the specific specifications of a plane. The weight of a plane is determined by the volume of the plane's wing, the weight of the plane's wing and the weight of its airframe. When a plane is flying, it needs to provide the appropriate level of friction to lift the aircraft at a safe distance from the ground. Therefore, when we fly a plane, the force required to keep it safe is the opposite of the plane's friction. So, when it's flying, it has no friction with the A wings, because that is the factor that helps it to retain the balance of the aircraft. The plane's weight is distributed evenly, and their weight is not affected by the friction. As a result, the plane can fly smoothly, and the airspace at its own pace is stable. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, when a plane is flying, the A wings can not suffer from friction with the A wings. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, a plane is using a lift mechanism that moves on the wing of the vehicle in front of it to avoid obstacles. On the other hand, a plane is traveling on a flight path and requires airspace clearance before it can land. Therefore, when it is flies, the wing of the plane is not facing off when flying. Thus, when the plane is flying, it is not dealing with any type of air noise or vibrations from the air. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no, a plane does not have friction with the A-wings when it is flies. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand the terminology - friction. Friction refers to the action or sound of an object with opposing curved surfaces, usually between two opposite-dual or straight-line surfaces. When it's flying, the air pressure between the plane's airframe and its aircraft is called pressure. This pressure is known as pressure or fluid friction. In most airplanes, the air pressure is above the ground (AGL), which is also called air pressure, or airborne friction. When flying, the air pressure (VFR) is below the ground or below the plane's airframe. This is when the plane's airspace is in contact with air. As the air pressure increases, the air pressure rises, which causes friction between the plane and airspace. Therefore, when a plane is flying, the air pressure is below the ground or below the plane's airspace. When it's flying, the air pressure is higher or lower than the plane's airframe and air has no friction. Thus, the answer is (A) Yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what friction is in terms of when flying a plane. It is the surface tension and impact on the ground. Next, let's consider the effect friction makes on a plane's surface. When a plane is flying, the surface tension and impact on the airways are incredibly low. Airspace can become cold and air is hard to work with if not drained enough. So, when a plane is flying, it has no friction at all, so it will not cause any disruption to the airway at all. Hence, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A"

        "Airspace class (United States) . Controlled airspace which is neither class A, B, C nor D. In most areas of the United States, class E airspace extends from above ground level (AGL) up to but not including MSL, the lower limit of class A airspace. There are areas where class E airspace begins at either the surface or 700 AGL, these areas are used to transition between the terminal and en-route environments (around non-towered airports). These areas are designated on sectional charts. Most airspace in the United States is class E. The airspace above FL600 is also class E. No ATC clearance or radio communication is required for VFR flight in class E airspace. VFR visibility and cloud clearance requirements are the same as for class C and D airspaces when below MSL. Above 10,000\u00a0ft MSL, the visibility requirement is extended to and the cloud clearance requirement is extended to below clouds, above, and laterally."
