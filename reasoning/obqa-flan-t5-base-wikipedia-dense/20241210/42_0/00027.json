        "1. What are we looking for? 2. What is the correct system? Answer: B",
        "Firstly, a body is mainly responsible for absorbing oxygen throughout the body, such as the blood, the lungs, and the digestive system. Secondly, to obtain gas, the body needs to have an adequate supply of oxygen to help the body receive it. This includes the circulatory system, which provides the vital fluid through the body's lungs. Therefore, the body needs a suitable supply of oxygen for its own system, which requires oxygen to stay gasergic. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) the circulatory system. Answer: A",
        "First, it is important to understand what the circulatory system (CNS) entails. The CNS is the nerve system that control bodily functions and transport signals between the body and the other parts of the body. It also controls how the body travels, digests, and senses health messages and symptoms. Now, let's consider the supply of gases in the body. According to our science, we breathe. The average amount of gas in our bodies is around 75 to 90% of the human body. This means that oxygen and hydrogen gas supply for our body is significantly lower than it has been before. Therefore, if there is no body system that monitor the abiotic environment and supply the required amount of gas, there is no need for a central nervous system to be necessary. Thus, we can conclude that the correct answer to the question is (D) the central nervous system. The central nervous system is the primary system in which the nervous system organs communicate, exchange, and communicate with each other, providing security and coordination to ensure that the function of a body is properly coordinated, balanced, and functioning properly. It is not only essential to have enough oxygen to survive the body but, also essential to support vital organ functions during the entire journey. Answer: D",
        "First, the body's respiratory system is responsible for the transport of oxygen and other nutrients from the lungs. Next, the digestive system is the central nervous system. The digestive system is responsible for the digestive process, which primarily regulates bodily functions. When a body needs oxygen, it needs to rely on the digestive system, which has two main organs: the central nervous system and the digestive system. Based on these two processes, it is likely that the breathing system needs oxygen to provide oxygen and nutrients to the body. In order to survive, the digestive system needs oxygen to circulate water around the food and in the rest of the body. The digestive system needs to have a balance of its own to provide a steady supply of oxygen to the body. Therefore, based on these principles, the system would need a balance of oxygen supply to provide its needs. The digestive system needs the appropriate body for keeping oxygen and nutrients flowing properly and avoiding potential coma and other health complications. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (A) yes, the digestive system is needed to provide essential supply of oxygen for the body, and the digestive system needs to flow a steady supply of oxygen and nutrients throughout the body to maintain it and function properly. Answer: A",
        "In order to produce enough gas, we need the digestive system. The digestive system is responsible for keeping a senescent body that senses food and shelters the digestive enzymes, as well as for keeping its body breathing and running smoothly. When a body needs food, it needs to use the digestive system as well. This helps to maintain a stable body weight and maintain a healthy balance. Lastly, oxygen is essential to the body's ability to respire and regulate its body functions. Without oxygen, the body's natural respiration and the circulatory system can also fail. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) the digestive system is responsible for getting the required supply of gas. Answer: A"

        "Nervous system . The nervous system is the part of an animal that coordinates its actions by transmitting signals to and from different parts of its body. The nervous system detects environmental changes that impact the body, then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond to such events. Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago. In vertebrates it consists of two main parts, the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord. The PNS consists mainly of nerves, which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons, that connect the CNS to every other part of the body. Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called \"motor\" or \"efferent\" nerves, while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called \"sensory\" or \"afferent\". Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called \"mixed\" nerves. The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems, the somatic, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems. Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement. The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy, while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state. The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system. Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily. Nerves that exit from the cranium are called cranial nerves while those exiting from the spinal cord are called spinal nerves."
