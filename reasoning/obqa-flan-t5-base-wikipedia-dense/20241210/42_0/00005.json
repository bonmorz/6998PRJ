        "First, we need to understand the composition of an atmosphere. An atmosphere is a layer of oxygen in the air that is emitted by organisms. As a result of deforesting an organism, the oxygen in the air is converted into carbon dioxide. So when the rain forest is deforested, the air is filled with oxygen, and the nitrogen is released. The increase in oxygen is primarily for photosynthesis and respiration. Therefore, it is clear that the air we are exposed to as an organism is deforested. So, we can conclude that the atmospheric composition of an environment is as an increase in the atmosphere. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, the air can be deforested as it is deforested. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what the atmosphere of Earth is made of. The Earth's atmosphere contains the nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, which are the three gases found in the world of the air. Now, let's consider the question. It is asking if the atmosphere is comprised of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and other gases. The answer is yes, because rain forest is made up of oxygen, but these gases are also composed of carbon dioxide. During deforestation, the Earth's atmosphere was made up of carbon dioxide, which is not a carbon dioxide. Therefore, it can be concluded that the atmosphere of the Earth is made up of carbon dioxide in order to prevent air from being blown into the atmosphere due to the deforested environment. Thus, the correct answer is (A) yes, the atmosphere of the earth is made up of carbon dioxide as the deforested environment. Answer: A",
        "First, what is the atmosphere? The atmosphere of the Earth is composed of substances that are designed to provide food and shelter to living organisms. The greenhouse gases that cause this change are carbon, aluminum, and nitrogen. Next, what is the amount of nitrogen released when it comes into contact with the earth? This is about 5% of the Earth's nitrogen content. So, if the earth was made of natural gas like coal, water, or salt, then the atmospheric would increase with these particles. The atmosphere of Earth is made up of these two elements. As it was before the rain, the atmosphere of Earth has more nitrogen than alpha nitrogen. Therefore, if the rain was deforsted, there would be more nitrogen. This means that the atmosphere will increase with more oxygen than alpha nitrogen, which means that the equinox of nitrogen would only increase at the expense of the atmosphere and the nitrogen would only increase with less nitrogen. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes, the atmosphere will increase with more oxygen than air. Answer: A",
        "First, what is the atmosphere? It is the part of Earth that is covered in nitrogen, oxygen, and other gases. Second, what is nitrogen? It is the element responsible for the creation of the earth's atmosphere. So, to understand the question, let's think about the answer. Now, the question is asking if the atmosphere will increase as the rain forest becomes deforested. If the forest is deforested, the atmosphere will increase with both nitrogen and nitrogen. If the atmosphere is covered by rain, this means that the atmospheric will increase with nitrogen and nitrogen. In other words, if the forest is being deforested, the atmosphere will increase with nitrogen and nitrogen. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "The carbon dioxide that enters the atmosphere means it is made up of carbon, which is responsible for water cooling, acoustics, and fire growth. Now, let's look at the question. As the rain forest is deforested the air temperature will increase. As the moisture level decreases, oxygen and carbon come together to form an additional layer called the arctic floor. As precipitation reaches the sky, the molecules within the arctic sheet of the Earth are released to form a solidifying layer. Now, now the questions are about the effect of deforested air temperature, carbon, and nitrogen in the air. When this layer is deforested, the atmosphere will increase with a higher concentration of carbon and carbon dioxide, as it is made up of carbon and oxygen. Therefore, the correct answer is (A): Rain forest is deforested, carbon dioxide (B) is a necessary component for human life, while the atmosphere is composed primarily of carbon and nitrogen.

        "Atmosphere . The atmosphere of Earth is composed of nitrogen (about 78%), oxygen (about 21%), argon (about 0.9%) with carbon dioxide and other gases in trace amounts. Oxygen is used by most organisms for respiration; nitrogen is fixed by bacteria and lightning to produce ammonia used in the construction of nucleotides and amino acids; and carbon dioxide is used by plants, algae and cyanobacteria for photosynthesis. The atmosphere helps to protect living organisms from genetic damage by solar ultraviolet radiation, solar wind and cosmic rays. The current composition of the Earth's atmosphere is the product of billions of years of biochemical modification of the paleoatmosphere by living organisms."
