        "First, we need to understand what an object's heat induced. An object's heat induced could be as small or as high as it could be. Therefore, if balloons heat up, it would eventually heat up and become bigger. Thus, the answer is (A) they get bigger. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what balloons are. They are a type of balloon that is commonly used in balloons to store energy. When a balloon reaches its height and pressure, it expands and lands on the surface of the ground. Therefore, the size of balloons can be increased when the temperature rises significantly. Now, let's consider the behavior of balloons. When balloons go up into a large temperature, they can expand in a fast speed and drop faster than the water in the water, and they can fall in the direction of the center of the water. While the speed of the balloon increases, the air pressure drop significantly, and the pressure decreases more slowly than the balloon itself. This allows the balloon's shape to change, and the balloon's height changes rapidly. Moreover, balloons heat up frequently and can easily change the shape of the balloon if needed, and can easily make it smaller and more powerful. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A): they get bigger. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to understand what balloons are. They are balloons that produce gas molecules in their upper surface. They are made of gases like sulfur and helium, which are a common type of gas in space. They are not volatile, they have a definite temperature of 170\u00b0F. Secondly, when a pressure drop falls on a ball of gas, they are caused to lose their heat. This is because the air is released into the air by the atoms in their lower surface. Therefore, when the balloon is at its maximum pressure, it becomes smaller and grows bigger. In conclusion, when balloons heat up, they become bigger and bigger, making balloons more powerful and powerful. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) they get bigger. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to understand what the process of heat is. Since balloons are a type of medium-sized liquid particles in water that are held together by small particles on a surface, it can be assumed that they would not have the same physical characteristics as the water in the balloon. Secondly, when they heat up, they create energy, which causes the air and air around the balloon to heat up, and the volume of the balloon and its particles to decrease. So, to conclude, the answer would become (A) they get bigger. Answer: A",
        "When balloons heat up, they're surrounded by hot air and then melt to a more dense, powerful liquid. This process would be called fusion or cosplay. When they melt, the liquid of the balloons heats up, so the volume of the balloon can increase by releasing heat. While it's not a known phenomenon, it's safe to assume that balloons will melt, if not fusion, as its heat expands. That could also indicate a change in the shape and size of the balloons. If the balloons burn, the liquid of the balloons will rise into the air, causing a change in shape and size. On the other hand, if the balloons melt, the balloons will become less dense, forming a fusion of gases. This change could mean that the balloons will need to re-burn or burn some more because they will not burn the same way when the air turns white. This change could also mean that the balloons will become less dense and less stable in the atmosphere. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) they would happen when balloons heat up.

        "A Brief History of Time . Hawking realized that the event horizon of a black hole could only get bigger, not smaller. The area of the event horizon of a black hole gets bigger whenever something falls into the black hole. He also realized that when two black holes combine, the size of the new event horizon is greater than or equal to the sum of the event horizons of the two other black holes. This means that a black hole's event horizon can never get smaller."
