        "Firstly, what is a nest? A nest is a kind of biological cell membrane that is located directly within the body of a living organism. The nest is built of shells, which are found in places where the egg is inserted, and then leaves the rest of the body to be fertilized. Now, let's consider what reproduction requires. An embryo is an embryo that develops quickly to hatch from a sperm, which is fed by young incubation into an outgrowth, lining the embryo up, and finally hatching from the nest. It is not necessary to lay eggs to produce eggs, but rather to create eggs incubation in order for the embryos to hatch. So, the question is asking about human reproduction, and it is quite straightforward - it doesn't need to use a nest to create an embryo - just like any other creature or incubation technique. To achieve this, the eggs are laid firmly into a nest and laid to hatch. Without the shells and the eggs, human reproduction cannot take place. Therefore, it is important to consider the necessary materials to ensure that a chick can lay eggs without the need for an incubation time. Answer: B",
        "Human reproduction requires the establishment of an embryonic tube or hula-feet, and requires the establishment of a nest. Unlike nests, nests typically come primarily from sperm, eggs, and larval stages such as laying eggs or hatching out the seeds. However, the question asks about egg production with shells. Eggs with shells are needed in order to create eggs and establish a nest. So, without shells, it is not possible to create a nest. The nest is made from shells and a nest is laid by two pairs of individuals. Therefore, it is unlikely that eggs will hatch in this way. For example, if the eggs incubation is small enough to fill a nest with shells, you would need to create a nest of smaller ones for them to lay eggs. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) eggs with shells, or (B) nest incubation. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, humans have to lay eggs with shells in order to reproduce. While some species may not have any shells or have shelled eggs, they do exist and may be fertilized within a few months. Therefore, humans cannot reproduce without shells. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"no.\" Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what human reproduction requires. Human reproduction requires eggs, shells, and nests in the form of shells. Now, let's apply this logic. A nest is a layer or chamber on the sides of a living animal's body that is composed of materials like bones, fur, and feathers. This layer is typically placed in the shape of a nest and is surrounded by roots. Now, we can analyze and analyze the reproductive processes of each animal. If we add a few other factors such as whether mammals can reproduce or if certain factors or types of animals can be studied, we can say that the reproductive system of the animal is responsible for determining the results of reproduction. When humans lay their eggs, they usually lay more eggs than the other animals or organisms in their nest. While humans lay their eggs and typically hatch to lay their eggs in the same environment as other animals, they also often have more shells and other materials in their nest to help ensure they survive. Therefore, when it comes to human reproduction, it is important to consider the context of this question. As we know, humans are living organisms who have evolved to be dependent on animals, including humans and their offspring, but they also have a much larger egg population and the ability to survive at large. In addition, human eggs and shells are important to the success of reproduction. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) eggs with shells with biological material or shells with natural materials that can be studied, but only by means of analyzing more specific and specific scientific evidence. Answer: A",
        "First of all, what is reproduction? Reproduction typically involves the creation of a single embryo, then the birth of a mammal. Next, we need to consider the first factor: eggs. As an adult, the egg may not contain shells, but a sperm may provide protection for the egg and the shells. However, these shells are small and do not have the physical attributes that humans have to reproduce. They are also needed for the egg to lay after incubation, which is when both eggs are fertilized and frozen. Given this reasoning, it is logical to assume that incubation is essential to the development of human reproduction. Therefore, the answer is (A) eggs with shells is key. Answer: A"

        "Eurasian tree sparrow . The untidy nest is composed of hay, grass, wool or other material and lined with feathers, which improve the thermal insulation. A complete nest consists of three layers; base, lining and dome. The typical clutch is five or six eggs (rarely more than four in Malaysia), white to pale grey and heavily marked with spots, small blotches, or speckling; they are in size and weigh , of which 7% is shell. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 12\u201313 days before the altricial, naked chicks hatch, and a further 15\u201318 days elapse before they fledge. Two or three broods may be raised each year; birds breeding in colonies produce more eggs and fledglings from their first broods than solitary pairs, but the reverse is true for second and third clutches. Females which copulate frequently tend to lay more eggs and have a shorter incubation time, so within-pair mating may be an indicator of the pairs' reproductive ability. There is a significant level of promiscuity; in a Hungarian study, more than 9% of chicks were sired by extra-pair males, and 20% of the broods contained at least one extra-pair young."
