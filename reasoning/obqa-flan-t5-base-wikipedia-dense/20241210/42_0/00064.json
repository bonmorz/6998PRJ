        "First, we need to define what a BBQ is. A BBQ is a type of food or drink that is barbecued. Next, we need to analyze whether or not Mosquitoes are known to be dislikeful or harmful to people. Mosquitoes do not seem to enjoy food so they are not accustomed to them. They are a social organism and they are not generally seen as being sensitive to stress. Therefore, we can assume that Mosquitoes are not likely to enjoy all the people at a BBQ due to their dietary preferences and dislike for BBQ. They may have had digestive problems during their en-masse and may not be able to eat as they if eating seafood is not appropriate. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know what a BBQ is. It refers to a celebration or party made by a person. Next, we need to find out where the animals are found. Mosquitoes are found in Asia, South America, and some parts of Africa. Next, we need to understand the meaning of BBQ. A BBQ is a gathering of meats and other foods that are made to be shared or eaten. So, while there may not be a BBQ that contains a lot of meat, there may be some people at a BBQ that enjoy a BBQ for the sake of food or entertainment. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, mobbits enjoy all the people at a BBQ in the summer for some reason. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, BBQs are traditionally held in open air, meaning that the environment is open to people without restriction. Therefore, it is not likely that mosquitoes enjoy taking meals at a BBQ in the summer, unless they are eating something that makes their mouth water. Secondly, when mosquitoes gather in a yard or outdoors, they may enjoy the weather, where it is cooler and sunnier, as they enjoy the coolness and less stress of living in a warmer climate. Lastly, when it comes to mosquitoes, it is unlikely that they would be excited about food, so they may prefer to be prepared and watch a BBQ during the summer season. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) anecdotal: \"All people at a BBQ in the summer for something is why Mosquitoes enjoy all the people at a BBQ in the summer.\" - Answer: B",
        "Firstly, it is important to understand that mosquitoes are known for their dislike of water. Now, let's consider the weather at a BBQ, which is typically not favorable for these types of animals. This means that they may not be able to feed on water or water, which is not suitable for Mosquitans, who are a type of fish species. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, mosquitoes do not enjoy all people at a BBQ in the summer for the reason that they might not like the weather. Answer: B",
        "1. Mosquitos are a type of bird that do not enjoy hot temperatures or low temperatures. 2. In fact, it can become a lot of trouble for the clams and their family to come into the pond for feeding. 3. So, the question is asking if the mobite would enjoy all the people at a BBQ in the summer for some reason. 4. Therefore, the answer is (C) Nice weather. Answer: C"

        "Hepatitis . Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people have no symptoms whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes, poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Hepatitis may be temporary (acute) or long term (chronic) depending on whether it lasts for less than or more than six months. Acute hepatitis can sometimes resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or rarely result in acute liver failure. Over time the chronic form may progress to scarring of the liver, liver failure, or liver cancer. The most common cause worldwide is viruses. Other causes include heavy alcohol use, certain medications, toxins, other infections, autoimmune diseases, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). There are five main types of viral hepatitis: type A, B, C, D, and E. Hepatitis A and E are mainly spread by contaminated food and water. Hepatitis B is mainly sexually transmitted, but may also be passed from mother to baby during pregnancy or childbirth. Both hepatitis B and hepatitis C are commonly spread through infected blood such as may occur during needle sharing by intravenous drug users. Hepatitis D can only infect people already infected with hepatitis B. Hepatitis A, B, and D are preventable with immunization. Medications may be used to treat chronic cases of viral hepatitis. There is no specific treatment for NASH; however, a healthy lifestyle, including physical activity, a healthy diet, and weight loss, is important. Autoimmune hepatitis may be treated with medications to suppress the immune system. A liver transplant may also be an option in certain cases. Worldwide in 2015, hepatitis A occurred in about 114 million people, chronic hepatitis B affected about 343 million people and chronic hepatitis C about 142 million people. In the United States, NASH affects about 11 million people and alcoholic hepatitis affects about 5 million people. Hepatitis results in more than a million deaths a year, most of which occur indirectly from liver scarring or liver cancer. In the United States, hepatitis A is estimated to occur in about 2,500 people a year and results in about 75 deaths. The word is derived from the Greek \"h\u00eapar\" (), meaning \"liver\", and \"-itis\" (), meaning \"inflammation\"."
