        "First, we need to identify the substances that are capable of dripping. To do so, we need to identify and hydrate the substances that are capable of dripping. This includes water, oxygen, and light. Wood is a type of wood, and the material used for dripping is wood. Glue is a liquid-based material that has been extensively used as a stabilizer for plastic materials. Now we need to understand the chemical properties of each substance. It is generally used for urination, boiling, cooling, and dissolving, and is capable of dripping for its temperature, liquid content and texture. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (A) yes, the substance is capable of dripping. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what a dripping is. A dripping is the liquid of a liquid. Now, we need to understand what makes an object to \"drip\" according to its properties. The physical properties of a liquid are determined by how it is cooled, vaporized, and released. In a liquid, the liquid dissolves and evaporates, until it dissolves to the surface. So, a liquid substance can be made to saturate in water for dripping. However, there are many other liquids that are capable of dripping, such as wine and gasoline. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) Oxygen. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what dripping means. Dripping is a process where a liquid or liquid substance bursts off of its surface and dissolves in another liquid or solid medium. Now, let's consider alcohol. Alcohol is a gas that is formed when a liquid dissolved in alcohol falls over and dissolves in alcohol. In the case of water, it can be dissolved in water, which will cause fluid to condende, making the mixture difficult to pour. It is also known that oxygen and other molecules are created together in a solid substance called a \"liquid\" and cannot dripped by itself. When water dripping is made, the water is dissolved into alcohol and the liquid dripping is made into a liquid. This is why dripping is a common practice in many countries where dripping is considered a hazardous practice to do. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Oxygen. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to know what is meant by \"dripping.\" Dyetting is the process of inleting a liquid or gas from a solid or liquid by a process called diffusion, which is a highly soluble liquid in some liquid, such as lava or clay. So, if a liquid becomes dripped from a solid, it would not be able to completely dripping. However, if it were liquid or gas, it would not be able to completely dripping until the liquid is vapor. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, since a liquid would not be able to completely dripping. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what dripping means. Putting all the relevant information together, we can determine that dripping refers to the absorption of volatile electrical energy. This is especially important since dripping can lead to unwanted effects and discomfort. Next, we need to consider the properties of the solid material we are dealing with. We cannot put these two elements together without any interference or harm to the environment. A solid substance would have a liquid consistency and would provide a sonic spectrum that would provide a phthal effect. Therefore, dripping would be a particularly powerful behavior to play on. In summary, we can conclude that while the solid material we are dealing with may not provide the necessary physical properties that will work and provide an optimal cooling, the process that will work, enables dripping to be an effective emulating process. Thus, the answer to the question is (A) Oxygen. Answer: A"

        "Oxygen . Oxygen condenses at 90.20\u00a0K (\u2212182.95\u00a0\u00b0C, \u2212297.31\u00a0\u00b0F), and freezes at 54.36\u00a0K (\u2212218.79\u00a0\u00b0C, \u2212361.82\u00a0\u00b0F). Both liquid and solid are clear substances with a light sky-blue color caused by absorption in the red (in contrast with the blue color of the sky, which is due to Rayleigh scattering of blue light). High-purity liquid is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied air. Liquid oxygen may also be condensed from air using liquid nitrogen as a coolant."
