        "Firstly, we need to understand what dirt is made from. It is primarily made of small particles such as minerals, which are carried by animals or plants. Now, let's focus on the main component in dirt - microorganisms. These microorganisms are responsible for building and functioning of bacteria. Next, we need to consider the role played by bacteria, which means that microorganisms are present in the soil when we touch them. These organisms are responsible for the movement of microorganisms in the soil, and have the potential to disrupt or inhibit these functions. Now, we can say that dirty environment often creates an environment that is prone to microorganisms. Microorganisms, including the bacteria found in the dirt, can cause microorganisms to reproduce and cause harm to their colonies. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, dirt is not the main component in dirt, and it is not necessary for microorganisms to become active and active. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, dirt is generally made up of materials such as sand, sand, and sand. Next, we need to understand the role of microorganisms in these materials. The main component of dirt is water. Deforestation is when human workers leave the sewage and other sources of water in their homes or on their backs to make more of the water that is pumped out from their homes. It is important to note that bacteria and viruses are not directly connected to dirt. Therefore, the question is asking whether dust is the primary component in dirt or not. First, we need to understand that dirt is often referred to as a medium or process when cleaning or drying it, depending on whether or not it is made up of microorganisms, such as dirt. So, the answer is (A) yes, which is good for you, but it is important to clean too much dust or leave dirt particles in the dirt. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what dirt is. Hard surfaces are made up of microorganisms, usually coiled or folded. This means that dirt is not likely to be densely conductive or hosped on a human body. So, we need to focus on the coiled or folded part of dirt. These microorganisms are naturally present in hard surfaces such as floors, walls, and walls. Next, we need to understand what it means for a human to come into contact with dirt. In general, people are able to get in touch with dirt when they have been exposed to dust, but also when they are not able to get close to dirt due to damage from chemicals or other factors that affect their immune system. This means that the human body is required to maintain proper functioning, especially when it comes to dirty environments. Therefore, the answer is (A) - dirt is a primary component in a person's body, and there are many different levels of dirt available that are needed to maintain healthy body structure. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what is the key component in dirt. It includes bacteria, microorganisms, and fungi. The primary ingredients in dirt include dust, dirt, and debris. Next, we need to understand what is meant by \"middle ground.\" It refers to or includes a place or object that is constantly exposed to water and is not cleaned regularly or buried. Generally, we can assume that dirt is a mixture of various substances, including small and moss-like particles. These particles consist of moss-like particles and lichens. In order to function properly, we need to withstand the same environmental and biological challenges. If we are growing up and still not having access to a clean environment, we may become aware of the environmental impacts of dirt and bacteria. These microorganisms are also present in the dirt due to their large size and lack of attention to dirt. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, the main component in dirt is microorganisms. Based on the above definition, it is evident that we are interested in identifying the main component in dirt. It is important to be proactive and to work with the environment to prevent these bacteria from coming into our homes or homes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what dirt is. Dirt is a mixture of water and soil where the dirt meets dirt. It is made up of microorganisms such as spiders, grasshoppers, and insects. Next, we need to understand what bacteria exist in dirt. Bacteria are bacterial colonies that appear when a person tries to push their opponent to the surface of dirt. This bacteria produces a variety of viral infections, which are caused by a specific bacteria. Now, to determine what dirt means, we need to consider what bacteria are and dirt. After conducting some research, we discover that the most common bacteria in dirt are bacteria that are prone to infection. For example, small fungi, such as beetles, are common in dirt. This association is due to the fact that beetles are resistant to infestation and make it difficult for people to survive on their own. As a result, microorganisms are often found in dirt, which means they are present. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A), we can focus on a different type of bacteria that thrive in dirt. The main ingredient in dirt is bacteria, which is made up of microorganisms. Therefore, in this case, the main component is microorganisms. Answer: A"

        "Dirt . Modern society is now thought to be more hygienic. Lack of contact with microorganisms in dirt when growing up is hypothesised to be the cause of the epidemic of allergies such as asthma. The human immune system requires activation and exercise in order to function properly and exposure to dirt may achieve this. For example, the presence of staphylococcus bacteria on the surface of the skin regulates the inflammation which results from injury."
