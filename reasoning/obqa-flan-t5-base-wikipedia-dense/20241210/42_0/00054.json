        "First, we need to know the relevant dates for the same birth. A girl's name is Sarah. Her mother's name is Kristyn. Therefore, there are two different genders: girls and mothers. Next, we need to determine the date of birth for a girl. This means that the day of her birth is closest to the same as the date of her birth. Finally, we need to determine if the mother has identical DNA as the parent. After researching and searching, we find that the mother's name is not exactly the same. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) a girl and her mom have the same date of birth. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to determine what date of birth we refer to. We know that the first child born on the same date is not the same day, which is XY for birth date. Therefore, the same date can be used in the question. Next, we need to determine if the two girl and their mom have the same birth date. This means that the girl and her mom have the same birth day. Therefore, the answer to the question is (XY for birth date) + 1 or (Y) for birth month. + 1 or (Y) for birth month. = 1 (XY for birth month) + 1 (Y) for birth year. + 1 (YY for birth year) + 1 (Y) for birth month. + 1 (Y) for birth year - = 1 (XY for birth year - = 1 (YY for birth year) + 1 (YY for birth month - = 1) = xYY for birth year - 8. Thus, the correct answer is (XY for birth month) + 1 (YY for birth month) + 1 (YY for birth year) + 1 (YY for birth month - 1) = 1 (XY for birth month) + 1 (YY for birth month) = 2 (YY for birth year) = xYY for birth year - = 0 (YY for birth month) = 0 (YY for birth year) + 1 (YY for birth year) = yYY - 1 (YY for birth month) = yYY for birth year - 1 (YY for birth year) + 1 (YY for birth year) = 2 (YY for birth month) + 2 (YY for birth year) + 1 (YY for birth month) + 1 (YY for birth month) + 1 (YY for birth year = xY - 1 (YY for birth month) + 1 (YY for birth year = XY for birth month) = 2 (YY for birth year) = 1 (YY for birth year) + 1 (YY for birth year - 2 (YY for birth month) = YY for birth month - 2 (YY for birth month -1) = yY for birth month - 2 (YY for birth month) = yY for birth month - 1 (YY for birth month) + 1 (YY for birth month) = yYY for birth month - 1,Y for birth month = yY + 1 (YY for birth month) = 1 (YY for birth year) = 5 (YYY for birth month) = yY for birth month = 20 (YY for birth month) + 2 (YY for birth month) = 5 (YY for birth year) + 1 (YY for birth month) = yY + 0 (YY for birth year) + 1 (YY for birth year) = 30 (YY for birth month) + 2 (YY for birth year) = 36 (YY for birth year) = 1 (YY for birth year) = 5 (YY for birth month) + 1 (YY for birth month = 5 (YY for birth month) = 32 (YY for birth year) = 25 (YY for birth month) = 36 (YY for birth month - 1) = 5 (YY for birth month) + YY for birth year = 9 (YY for birth month) = 30 (YY for birth month) = yY for birth month = 29 (YY for birth year) = 33 (YY for birth month) = YY for birth month = 41 (YY for birth month) = yY for birth year = 30 (YY for birth month) = 77 (YY for birth month) = 50 (YY for birth year = 50 (YY for birth year) + 1 (YY for birth month) = YY for birth month - 2Y for birth month) = 28 (YY for birth month) = YY for birth month = YYY for birth month - 2 (YY for birth month) = 42",
        "First, we need to understand what \"A\" means. \"A\" means a girl, while \"B\" means \"mother.\" Now, we know that a girl and her mother are two different types of adults, with different genders and body types. Therefore, the question is about whether a girl and her mother have the same birth date, which also refers to their birth date, or not. This information can be used to determine whether one girl and her mom have the same birthdate. This means that the girl's birthdate can be changed to the other girl, because it refers to the same girl, so the girl's birthdate is changed to the other girl's birthdate. Assuming that the question is not about the girl's birthdate, the correct answer is (A) we can assume that the question is about a girl and her mom. As they are two different individuals, it is safe to say that their birthdate should be the same. However, the answer is not generally the same as the birthdate for both kids. Answer: A",
        "- First, we need to know the dates of birth of both babies. - The girl's birthdate is 7 days after her first date of birth. - Next, we need to know the birthdate of her child. The first day of birth is not a physical date, but a calendar year. - The middleday of the year is a month and the fourth day of the month is a year. - Next, we need to know the date of birth for the mother and her baby. The female sex number is 1. Therefore, both babies have a YY date of birth, which is based on their birthdate, and their baby sex size. - The total number of total letters in the YY date of their birth is 1. Now, we can look at the answer choices and find out that they all have the same date of birth. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to determine the dates of birth of both of the girl and her mom. One woman who gave birth to a girl was born on November 21, 1912, while the other woman was born on January 26, 1886, which is less than the first year of the pregnancy. If we subtract one of each girl's mothers from the first year of her pregnancy, we get: 1) The mother's date of birth = (02/05) = 1905 (for males ONLY), 2) The father's date of birth = (02/05) = (01.07 (and the mother's name is not given) 2) The birth date of the daughter is (02/05/). The mother's name is (06/09) 5) The father's date of birth is (05/05/) 5) The mother's date of birth is (05/05/) (5) Therefore, if we subtract both mother's mothers' date of birth, we get: 1) The mother's name = 1 (for male and the calender of the second 3) The mother's calf is 1 (for female ONLY), the mother's calf is 1 (for female 3) The birth date of the girl is (09/03/4) The mother's calf is (02/03/4) The baby's date of birth is (15) the same \u2013 the mother's date of birth, also the mother's date of birth, is (14) The baby girl's name is (15)  (includes the \"Sume of Birth\" item). Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A"

The Albanian Identity Number is a unique personal identification number of 10 characters in the format YYMMDDSSSC, where YYMMDD indicates the date of birth and sex (for males MM is 01-12, for females 50 is added to the month of birth so that MM is 51-62), SSS is a sequence number of persons born on the same date (001\u2013999), and C is a checksum letter (A\u2013W).
