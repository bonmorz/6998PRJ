        "Plants are plants that grow in the natural environment where they are not exposed to sunlight, heat, or other sources of available nutrients. In order for plants to grow in natural sunlight and provide food for their growth, they require direct sunlight, which is available in the natural environment. If sunlight is scarce, plants will not grow. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) acid rain. A plants need direct sunlight to grow because sunlight is very damaging to plants. Based on these two steps, it is clear that growing plants requires direct sunlight, which means they need a shaded environment where they can have direct sunlight to grow and reproduce. This means that there is sufficient sunlight to grow plants. However, if we are living in an environment with moderate sunlight, we will need direct sunlight to grow. This means that plants need a lot of sunlight to grow and provide food for them. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) acid rain, which means that plants need direct sunlight to grow in natural settings. It also requires sun exposure, which can be provided in the form of shaded areas where the plants are able to grow. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what cultivating plants requires. Plants require sunlight and water to grow, which requires direct sunlight. However, it's important to note that the sunlight is necessary, so the plant may need direct sunlight to grow. To grow plants, the sun is essential for the growth and growth of the plant. Therefore, to grow plants, the plant requires direct sunlight and direct sunlight, as well as indirect sunlight. The sunlight is essential because the plant may need more sunlight than the regular sunlight, and it needs to grow faster, grow faster, and provide the necessary nutrients for the plant. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to understand what plants need to grow. Plants need to be fed by their natural environment, sunlight, and warmth to grow. Next, we need to understand what sunlight can make. Sunlight can provide a sufficient source of sunlight to grow plants. However, sunlight can also provide heat (such as light, water, etc.) while a plant requires limited sunlight to grow and to withstand the harshness of sunlight. Thus, to grow plants, it requires direct sunlight. Additionally, direct sunlight can provide the necessary nutrients and moisture for the plants to grow. Therefore, the answer to the question is the answer, \"At least direct sunlight.\" In order to grow plants, it requires direct sunlight, which can be an inestimable factor. Based on these factors, the answer to the question is yes, they require direct sunlight. Additionally, there are plants that can grow in a variety of different conditions, such as shady areas such as gardens or shaded areas. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (A) correct. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to understand what plants require sunlight for growth. Sunlight, specifically plants, can provide light and warmth to plants. However, when plants need sunlight, the plant will require a more limited amount of sunlight. Additionally, a shady environment can also be a barrier to growing plants. So, if we cannot provide enough light or sufficient sunlight to grow plants, there may be consequences. Additionally, as plants require sunlight, there may be certain conditions in which plants may grow. In some cases, some plants may not be adapted to shady conditions, while others may thrive in a moderate climate. However, it is important to note that the correct answer to the question is that plants require more sunlight than a shady location, and plants can depend on the conditions they are planted in to properly grow. The correct answer is (A) acid rain. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what a plant needs to grow. Plants need to be grown in a specific environment such as shady, shaded or open areas. Next, we need to consider what acid rain and light source are. Acid rain is a type of harmful ion, one that can pollinate the ground and rots the plant tissues. It can also strip the soil off and create more holes for nutrients to grow. Since we don't have access to both of these essential nutrients (and plants need enough water to thrive), we can now grow plants in shady or a shaded location. Therefore, we can conclude that plants require sunlight, which requires a good deal of water and light sources for a good root growth and growth. Therefore, the correct answer is (A): acid rain.

        "Shade garden . Shade gardens are gardens planted and grown in areas with little or no direct sunlight. Shade gardens may occur naturally or by design under trees, as well as on the side of buildings or fences. This style of garden presents certain challenges, in part because only certain plants are able to grow in shady conditions and otherwise there is direct competition for sunlight. Very few edible plants grow well in shady conditions, so shade gardens are usually ornamental gardens, though growing flowers may also be difficult in shade. Light shade, also known as \"dappled sunlight\", may support growing herbs or some leaf vegetables, but in addition to lack of light, trees and other large plants which create shade gardens may negatively impact soil fertility."
