        "Shirley Bassey . Bassey began to live as a tax exile in 1968, and was unable to work in Britain for almost two years. Also in 1968, at the Sanremo Festival in Italy, she performed \"La vita\", an Italian song by Bruno Canfora and Antonio Amurri, with some lyrics re-written in English by Norman Newell for her. Bassey's version of the song, with its chorus sung in Italian, became a Top 40 hit in Italy. Bassey recorded several songs in Italian, some appearing on the album \"La vita\" (1968). (Later, Newell would write English lyrics for the rest of \"La vita\", and the result was \"This Is My Life\".) But her UK sales continued to suffer. Bassey's UK comeback came in 1970, leading to one of the most successful periods of her career. Starting the year with a BBC Television 'Special' \"The Young Generation Meet Shirley Bassey\", recorded in Sweden and shown on BBC1 on 18 March. She returned to the UK with a record-breaking run of performances at the Talk of the Town nightclub. Also that year, her album \"Something\" was released, and showcased a new Bassey style, a shift from traditional pop to more contemporary songs and arrangements (the eponymous single was more successful in the UK charts than the original recording by The Beatles) \u2013 although Bassey would never completely abandon what that had been her forte: standards, show tunes, and torch songs."
