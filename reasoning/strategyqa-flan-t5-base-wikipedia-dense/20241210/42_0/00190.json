        "1. Who was Augustus? Augustus was a Roman emperor in the 14th century. 2. Who was the emperor? Augustus was a Roman king who was a general from the Middle Ages. 3.

Did the emperor's real name identify with Augustus? The correct answer is no. He did not have any real name of his daughter because the rumor did not show any information about his real name. 6. Using the answer as a starting point, we can conclude that Augustus never had his real name, and this is because there is no evidence to back this up. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to identify who Augustus was. He was a Roman king and emperor who served from 58 BC to 39 BC. Next, we need to find out what his real name was.

        "First, we need to establish who Augustus was. Augustus was a legendary Roman Roman god and one of the fourteen Roman emperors. Next, we need to determine if his real name was Tiberius Nero. Tiberius Nero was actually the name of a Roman courtier, not Augustus. Tiberius Nero was named after the Greek god Julius Caesar, the grandson of Claudius, who was also the son of Augustus. Based on this information, we can definitively say that Augustus was indeed his real name. Answer: A"

        "Nero Claudius Drusus . Drusus was the youngest son of Livia Drusilla from her marriage to Tiberius Claudius Nero, who was legally declared his father before the couple divorced. Drusus was born between mid-March and mid-April 38 BC, three months after Livia married Augustus on 17 January. Gerhard Radke has proposed the date of March 28 as his most likely birthday, while Lindsay Powell interprets Ovid's \"Fasti\" as indicating a date of 13 January. Rumors arose that Augustus was the child's real father, although this has never been authoritatively proven. Claudius, however, encouraged the rumor during his reign as emperor to create an impression of more direct lineage from Augustus."
