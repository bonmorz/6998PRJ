        "Fear of medical procedures . The fear of needles (simply called \"needle phobia\" in the medical literature, but sometimes trypanophobia) is sometimes a complex condition that can cause serious health problems that may sometimes result in the death of the patient. Some needle phobics refuse to receive shots that are mandatory, thus leading to greater risk of getting certain diseases, and many avoid treatment for serious medical conditions. Needle phobia is unique in the fact that it is a phobia that is documented to have resulted directly in the deaths of a few patients. In the New England Journal of Medicine, Lountzis and Rahman published an article about a 34-year-old woman who had a growth on her fingers that doctors were unable to completely remove because of her fear of needles."
