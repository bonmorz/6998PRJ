        "First, we need to understand that the largest crustacean is an organism that has a vast body of water, with a height of a typically 15 feet (excluding slender flat legs) on each chest. However, this is not the largest animal that our species is known for its size. The largest crustacean is found in the outer part of the Earth and its body of water. Therefore, it is impossible for the largest crustacean, which is the largest, to stretch out completely on a king-sized mattress. The correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine the size of the largest crustacean. According to scientific data, the largest crustacean is the largest living organism in the world weighing between 10-12 g/cm3 (the height of an African crustacean). Next, we need to determine how large a king-sized mattress would be. According to the measurements given to a professional or veterinary healthcare professional, a king-sized mattress has an average length of 2 feet, 8 feet, and 5-6 inches. Based on this information, we can see that a king-sized mattress is relatively small and not suitable for large-size organisms. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, the largest crustacean cannot stretch out completely on a king-sized mattress. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know the size of the largest crustacean. The largest crustacean is the smallest living organism in the world according to its approximate size. The size of a king-size mattress is approximately 32 feet by 63 feet. Next, we need to know the height and width of the largest crustacean. The size of a king-sized mattress is 73 feet long. Finally, we need to compare the size of the largest crustacean to the length and height of the queen mattress. According to the size, the longest crustacean can stretch out at least 71 feet to cover the entire length of the mattress. To understand this more accurately, we can analyze a tensile analysis of the largest crustacean's height. The maximum weight of a king-size mattress is approximately 8,3 feet in diameter. Therefore, the largest crustacean can easily stretch out on a king-sized mattress, making answer (A) the correct answer. Answer: A",
        "Step 1: First, consider the size and mass of the largest crustacean. According to our own knowledge, crustaceans can be as large as a penguin. Step 2: Compare the size of the king-sized mattress with the size of the crustacean: 3.5 (Hallowase), 4 (4h), 6 (Billeye) and 4 (8h). Step 3: Depending on the size and mass, the largest crustacean will stretch out completely - no. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, the largest crustacean cannot stretch out completely on a king-sized mattress. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know the size of the largest crustacean. The largest crustacean is a type of ostrich, also known as spider shell or bee shell. So, the largest crustacean is a skeletal creature that is generally regarded as being incredibly large at birth. Next, we need to determine the size of a king-sized mattress. The biggest mattress you need to fit on a king-sized mattress is about 7x8cm (24x24 cm). So, the largest crustacean is a ni of incredibly large human sizes. So, the question is whether a king-sized mattress can stretch out completely on a king-sized mattress. The answer is (A) yes. However, we cannot say for certain that it is possible. However, the answer is (B) no. While it is possible, even though it is possible, the largest crustacean can significantly stretch out of a mattress and not ideally stretch it out to the fullest extent possible. Answer: B"

        "Largest organisms . The largest organisms found on Earth can be determined according to various aspects of an organism's size, such as: mass, volume, area, length, height, or even genome size. Some organisms group together to form a superorganism (such as ants or bees), but such are not classed as single large organisms. The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest structure composed of living entities, stretching , but contains many organisms of many types of species."
