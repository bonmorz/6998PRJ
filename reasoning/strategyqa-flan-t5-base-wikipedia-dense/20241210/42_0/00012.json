        "Living funeral . Most living funerals have the same aspects of a normal funeral, the deceased person aside. A common theme is for the funeral to start off the same way that a normal funeral would; somber music, a casket, bible readings, etc. From there the tone is usually switched. Different music is played along with an all around happier atmosphere. The goal is for this to be happy, to celebrate a life and to give thanks to everyone attending. During a living funeral, families and friends will share stories and memories of the person who is nearing death. This ceremony is often a very happy event where there can be closure. The soon-to-be-deceased person often speaks about his or her life and who has affected it. Many people want to be able to show their appreciation through the living funeral. Friends and family of the person hosting the funeral will say things that they would have said at a normal funeral. Except now their loved one is there to hear it. Living funerals, called in Japanese, started being done in Japan in the 1990s. Elders in Japan feel that they are burdening their children with their old age. They are ashamed of their failing body. By having a living funeral they feel that they can take some of the stress away from the funeral. After this ceremony many Japanese \"expect nothing\" from their families after they die; including a funeral."
