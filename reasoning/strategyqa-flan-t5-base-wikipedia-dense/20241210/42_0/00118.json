        "Firstly, it is important to identify the creator of Futurama - it is Philip J. Fry. This means that Philip J. Fry is still alive today, and therefore no one in the family has lived in multiple centuries. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, we need to know who the creator of Futurama is. The creator of Futurama was a \"game roker\" actor who lived in the mid-20th century. Next, we need to find out if he has lived in multiple centuries. To do this, we can use the \"test score\" to determine if it is true that the creator of Futurama has lived in multiple centuries. Next, we need to consider the timeline of Futurama - it follows a timeline of the late 1940s to the early 1990s, which lasted from 1981 to 1973. Therefore, we can conclude that the creator of Futurama has passed away. The correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to identify who the creator of Futurama is. The creator of Futurama is Stephen Gong, a famous animator from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During this time, the creator did not exist and was unable to live. Next, we need to determine if the creator has lived in multiple centuries. There are several centuries in a timeline. The answer is yes, as Stephen Gung tells us that he died centuries ago, but no longer has lived. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to understand who the creator of Futurama is. The creator of Futurama is David Cohen, who is known to be a well-known animator and writer of cartoon characters. Next, we need to consider when Felix Hingus was born. Since the creation of Futurama began in the 1970s, it would not have been possible to have been alive in the period of time before Felix died. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the creator of Futurama has not yet lived in multiple centuries. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine when the creator of Futurama lived. The creator of Futurama is Matthew Greenfield, who was a cartoonist in the early 21th century, who lived from around the 17th century until the early 19th century. Next, we need to know if Greenfield was alive for at least one centuries. A quick search reveals that Greenfield died in 1924, which means Greenfield died approximately 30 years apart from Greenfield's birthplace. Therefore, Greenfield has not lived in multiple centuries. Furthermore, we can do research on the timeline of the creator of Futurama, who has lived for at least one century, to ensure he lived a lifetime. Greenfield has lived for nearly two centuries (in some cultures, even after Greenfield died). However, there are many factors to consider before making the decision, such as the time period, the context, the timeline of the creator, and the timeframe of the creator of Futurama. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A"
