        "First, we need to understand the anatomy of an average snake. In fact, the length of a snake is a bit longer than the diameter of a standard-issue dog. Therefore, if we assume that the snake has a larger tail, it is not possible for it to swallow an M60 Patton. Next, we need to consider the size of the M60 Patton. A M60 Patton is a small insect that is typically 2-3 meters in length, while a smaller one is around 1.4-4 meters tall. Based on the above information, we can conclude that a snake cannot swallow an M60 Patton due to the angle of its dispersal. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand the shape of the M60 Patton. It is a car model that has a rounded outer shell, a round outside mouth, and a round outer shell. Now, the question is asking if a snake can swallow the M60 Patton, referring to the main character and main body of a mammoth. The answer is yes, it is possible for the snake to swallow the M60 Patton. However, it is not necessarily advisable to assume this is their body, let alone being larger than the M60. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, a snake is a prey predator for many species, such as amphibians and narrated-birds. Secondly, the M60 is a high-end smartphone, the latest smartphone and the size of an M60 in the market. Now, let's focus on what an M60 is. A snake is a type of fish that can eat the flesh of various animals like spiders, snakes, and small insects. Therefore, it can swallow an M60 Patton, and the answer is (A) yes, a snake can swallow an M60 Patton. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, an M60 Patton is an average size coin that weighs around 7.5 tons. Secondly, snakes have a wide jaw, which allows them to open their mouths to eat a larger coin. Therefore, it is very unlikely that a snake can swallow such an expensive coin. Thirdly, while snakes are able to eat small objects and are not easily able to snare larger objects, they cannot swallow them completely - and they need to be able to choke them tightly to avoid deprioring harming their health and the environment. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a snake is. The type of snake is a snake, which is also known as a cat or dog that can weigh up to 300 pounds (150 kg). Now, we can consider the size of an M60 Patton. According to the US Air Force, a M60 is a small carnivorous dog that weighs up to 430 pounds (230 kg). Now, we can think of the approximate size of a snake and determine if it is possible to swallow an M60 Patton. Given this information, we can determine whether or not a snake can swallow an M60 Patton. Considering all of these facts, the answer is (A) yes, a snake can swallow an M60 Patton. Answer: A"

        "Snake . The snake's jaw is a complex structure. Contrary to the popular belief that snakes can dislocate their jaws, snakes have a very flexible lower jaw, the two halves of which are not rigidly attached, and numerous other joints in their skull (see snake skull), allowing them to open their mouths wide enough to swallow their prey whole, even if it is larger in diameter than the snake itself. For example, the African egg-eating snake has flexible jaws adapted for eating eggs much larger than the diameter of its head. This snake has no teeth, but does have bony protrusions on the inside edge of its spine, which it uses to break shells when it eats eggs."
