        "First, we need to understand what Durian is. It is a herb known for its savory flavor and is a staple for many people in their homes. Next, we need to understand what stomach conditions are typically caused by digestive troubles. They can include stomach discomfort, headaches, vomiting, and nausea. So, let's assume that Durian is a common heijac-like vegetable with a bitter, spongy body structure. While it can have a harmful odor and are unpleasant, it does not directly cause stomach discomfort or pain. It is important to follow certain treatment strategies and avoid any interaction with another insect, such as a parasitic or viral strain, to avoid further damage to the stomach. Therefore, we can confidently say (A) yes, Durian could cause someone's stomach to feel unwell. Answer: A",
        "First, Durian is a fruit species that commonly is known for its low calorie diet and high fiber content. This means that Durian can have a significant negative impact on the body's body weight. In a study in 2011, there was evidence that Durian could cause someone's stomach to feel unwell. These results were published in the journal \"Urban Medical Review: The Greatest Health Problems\", and \"Sunburns\" in \"Medical Review\" called a study that has identified that there is a risk of some people having stomach problems, including Durian. So, in summary, the answer to this question is (A) yes, Durian can cause someone's stomach to feel unwell. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what Durian means. Durian is a type of herb commonly used as an herb in the diet. It is known for its powerful narcotic effects, which are not likely to cause digestive issues or stomach discomfort. Now, let's ask ourselves if it is possible that Durian could cause someone's stomach to feel unwell. While it is not the only possible symptom, it is a common symptom in many cases. In cases of stomach discomfort, symptoms could include a feeling of numbness in one of the upper abdomen, spit cramp, or ache. In other cases, the body may also be unable to feel the pain, such as vomiting or vomiting. In summary, despite the commonity of Durian, it is not a common symptom of stomach discomfort and has been ruled as a medical hazard. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, it is possible for Durian to cause someone's stomach to feel unwell. Answer: A",
        "1. Durian is a plant that is commonly known as the herb \"Darno\". 2. Cucumber (such as carrots) can cause severe stomach or esophagus symptoms, including nausea, loss of sense, and digestive enzymes. 3. If someone has stomach pain, it is likely that the stomach may have a condition such as diarrhea or food poisoning. 4. Even if the stomach is still unbalanced and not properly hydrated, there is still an increased risk of stomach pain. 5. So, when it comes to asking whether someone's stomach could feel unwell, it is safe to say that the stomach has already had an acute medical emergency. This is because the stomach is not a coping mechanism for people with stomach pains, but for individuals who are experiencing symptoms like diarrhea or a feeling unsatisfying stomach discomfort, it is likely that it could trigger the stomach to feel unwell. 6. So, the answer to this question is (A) yes, it could cause someone's stomach to feel unwell, given the potential symptoms listed in the question. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, durian is a plant that is commonly used for a vegetable. Therefore, it can cause discomfort in people suffering from stomach pain. Secondly, if someone has stomach acid reflux or has an unbalanced body or digestive problem, the gut bacteria in their stomach may make it difficult for this inflammation. This is because the gut bacteria in the digestive lining of the stomach is responsible for the digestion of all nutrients in the body. Lastly, if someone has stomach acid reflux or is prescribed medical treatment, it can cause the symptoms of digestion to make it difficult to manage. It is important to note that stomach acid is essential to the function and functioning of the body, as you need to consume a balanced diet to maintain your health. Overall, while you can easily get sick or feel unwell if you eat a large amount of it, it is possible for digestive issues such as bloating, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, and low acid levels that could make the stomach feel unbalanced. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, durian could cause someone's stomach to feel unwell. Answer: A"

        "Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia . Vitamin B deficiency anemia, of which pernicious anemia is a type, is a disease in which not enough red blood cells are produced due to a deficiency of vitamin B. The most common initial symptom is feeling tired. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, pale skin, chest pain, numbness in the hands and feet, poor balance, a smooth red tongue, poor reflexes, depression and confusion. Without treatment some of these problems may become permanent. Pernicious anemia refers to anemia that results from not enough intrinsic factor. Lack of intrinsic factor is most commonly due to an autoimmune attack on the cells that create it in the stomach. It can also occur following the surgical removal of part of the stomach or from an inherited disorder. Other causes of low vitamin B include not enough dietary intake (such as in a vegan diet), celiac disease, or tapeworm infection. When suspected, diagnosis is made by blood and, occasionally, bone marrow tests. Blood tests may show fewer but larger red blood cells, low numbers of young red blood cells, low levels of vitamin B, and antibodies to intrinsic factor. Because pernicious anemia is due to a lack of intrinsic factor, it is not preventable. Vitamin B deficiency due to other causes may be prevented with a balanced diet or with supplements. Pernicious anemia can be easily treated with either injections or pills of vitamin B. If the symptoms are severe, injections are typically recommended initially. For those who have trouble swallowing pills, a nasal spray is available. Often, treatment is lifelong. Pernicious anemia due to autoimmune problems occurs in about one per 1000 people. Among those over the age of 60, about 2% have the condition. It more commonly affects people of northern European descent. Women are more commonly affected than men. With proper treatment, most people live normal lives. Due to a higher risk of stomach cancer, those with pernicious anemia should be checked regularly for this. The first clear description was by Thomas Addison in 1849. The term \"pernicious\" means \"deadly\", and was used as before the availability of treatment the disease was often fatal."
