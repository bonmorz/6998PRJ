        "First, we need to know what an ostrich is and what it means to \"can\" fit in a nest. An ostrich, on the other hand, is a type of bird that feeds on prey animals. However, this is not the norm for a bird to fit into a nest like a swallow or any other bird. Based on this theory, the answer is no - an ostrich cannot fit into a nest of a swallow. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, an ostrich is a prehistoric bird that lived in the tropics. Secondly, swallows are a terrestrial animal that can only lay in water and carry on for a lifetime. Now, let's compare their nests. An ostrich is one of the smallest birds on Earth and is not as large as the nest of a swallow. Therefore, it can not fit inside the nest of a swallow. Hence, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what an ostrich is. The ostrich is a small bird that is most often found in Africa, Europe, and many other different regions. Next, we need to understand what a swallow nest is. The swallow nest is a small circular structure that lands on a flat surface. Its shape and dimensions are designed to accommodate a variety of sizes, making it perfect for nesting in a nest of a swallow. Now, let's think about the nest. An ostrich lays its eggs in a simple nest placed in the ground, with little disturbance. A swallow nest is made up of different layers of thick and thick feathers, while a crocodile has a rough and narrow feathery body. Based on this information, it is difficult to assume that an ostrich could fit into a nest of a swallow. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, let's consider the size of an ostrich. This species is not generally known to be smaller than the average sized ostrich. Secondly, the nest of a swallow is limited to about 2-4 octaviles and is very small compared to the size of an ostrich's nest. So, can an ostrich fit into an ostrich nest? The answer is no. In fact, the ostrich is capable of laying its eggs quickly, which means that it won't have a chance of breaking the egg. Instead, it has the ability to nestle, but it needs to be properly adapted to a particular habitat or habitat. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, an ostrich cannot fit in the nest of a swallow. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know what an ostrich is and what its nest is. An ostrich is a wingless, herbivorous mammal native to Africa. Its length is 5 feet 6 inches, and its length is 7 feet. Next, we need to understand what a swallow is. A swallow is a small, thin fish native to Europe. It is adapted to hunt, catch prey, and lay eggs in a variety of insects. Based on these two facts, we can assume that an ostrich can fit in the nest of a swallow. The nest of a chicken is made up of two pieces of wood, a log made of ash, and a wooden structure built for the nesting of animals. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, an ostrich can fit into the nest of a swallow. Answer: A"

        "Common ostrich . The female common ostrich lays her fertilised eggs in a single communal nest, a simple pit, deep and wide, scraped in the ground by the male. The dominant female lays her eggs first, and when it is time to cover them for incubation she discards extra eggs from the weaker females, leaving about 20 in most cases. A female common ostrich can distinguish her own eggs from the others in a communal nest. Ostrich eggs are the largest of all eggs, though they are actually the smallest eggs relative to the size of the adult bird \u2014 on average they are long, wide, and weigh , over 20 times the weight of a chicken's egg and only 1 to 4% the size of the female. They are glossy cream-coloured, with thick shells marked by small pits."
