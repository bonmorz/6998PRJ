        "First, we need to understand the concept of a \"real\" money. Despite the name of the money used to pay for a coffee in NYC, it is not typically known to be a fair trade option. Therefore, it is unlikely that someone would pay for a coffee with Euros to be true. This is why it is crucial that we understand how it happened, and, as a result, we can answer the question. We can do this by asking a few questions, namely: Would someone pay for a coffee in NYC with Euros? The answer is yes. As we do this, we can indescribe, and the two most popular types of coffee are: Fair Trade, Fair Exchange and East India. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what a coffee is. A coffee is a beverage that typically costs about $1.50. Next, we need to determine if the coffee in NYC has a dollar rate. If a customer bought a cup of coffee from a European coffeehouse or supermarket, it would be a Euro. Euros are a currency used by people to conduct transactions. Since it does not have currency, it is not common practice to pay for a coffee in NYC with Euros. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, someone would pay for a coffee in NYC with Euros. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to know what the euro is. Euro is the currency used for checking and payment, which is often used to reimburse bills or even make purchases. On the other hand, we need to consider what a coffee in NYC costs. If we need to purchase the coffee with Euros, what is the cost of the coffee? According to a survey conducted by World Economic Council, the cost of a coffee in NYC in the US for the year 2017-29 is around $19,810, while for the same time, there are around $1,010 for adults, including taxi. To determine if some coffee shop in NYC would be able to afford to have Euros, we need to consider the available cost of the food, which is about $910-$15. Since one Euro and one American exchange were only around $12,10 for the same price, it seems unlikely that the person would be willing to pay for a coffee in NYC with Euros. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, what is the cost of a coffee in NYC? Typically, a typical $120 for a typical American coffee leaves would be $130 to pay. Secondly, do all European countries accept this price? No, there is no tax or currency limit in this case. Thirdly, there is no financial aid available for businesses or households that would cover this expense. Even if they did, they may not be able to use Euro to pay for the price of a coffee in NYC with Euros. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, someone would pay for a coffee in NYC with Euros. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what euros are. Euros are a set of currency denominations that are commonly used for payments in European countries. They are not a common currency used for international payments. Next, we need to consider the price of a coffee in NYC. NYC is a city located in New York State. Therefore, the price of a coffee in NYC with euro is essentially equivalent to the price of a typical coffee in Manhattan. However, if you go to New York to pay for a coffee with a euro, you may be able to pay for a coffee in the evening, with no need to take advantage of the price. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, someone would pay for a coffee in NYC with Euros. Answer: A"

        "Fair trade . Consumers typically have positive attitudes for products that are ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often are not willing to pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say they would be willing to pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee. Once enough consumers begin purchasing fair trade, companies are more likely to carry fair trade products. Safeway Inc. began carrying fair trade coffee after individual consumers dropped off postcards asking for it."
