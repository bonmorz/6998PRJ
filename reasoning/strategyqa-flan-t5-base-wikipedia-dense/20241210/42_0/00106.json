        "First, we need to understand what Glycol is. Glycol is a chemical commonly used to fight off abrasions in petroleum or to make detergents. Now, we need to consider the question being asked. The question is asking whether United Airlines would buy Glycol. We need to consider whether United Airlines is based on its product lines and ingredients. If United Airlines' product lines are based on petroleum or other products, then they would purchase Glycol. To determine if or not Glycol is something that United Airlines would buy, we can conduct research. Given these steps, we can conclude that the answer to the question is (A) yes.

Next, when a airline receives a cargo in a cargo aircraft that contains polyethylene glycol, it would be considered a dangerous substance to the airline's health. The term \"freeze\" would mean it was used in the exchange of fuel for which an airline is required to obtain fuel. Hence, Glycol could easily cause serious health issues. So, the correct answer is (A) yes, Glycol would be something United Airlines would buy, as it is likely to cause some health problems, as Glycol can be used in certain areas such as air transportation. Answer: A"

        "Antifreeze . Propylene glycol is considerably less toxic than ethylene glycol and may be labeled as \"non-toxic antifreeze\". It is used as antifreeze where ethylene glycol would be inappropriate, such as in food-processing systems or in water pipes in homes where incidental ingestion may be possible. For example, the FDA allows propylene glycol to be added to a large number of processed foods, including ice cream, frozen custard, salad dressings, and baked goods, and it is commonly used as the main ingredient in the \"e-liquid\" used in electronic cigarettes."
