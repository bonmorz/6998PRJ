        "American Dad! . Creative direction of \"American Dad!\" has largely been guided by Barker (prior to his exit from the show in season 10) and Weitzman as opposed to MacFarlane, resulting in a series that is different from its counterparts. Unlike its sister shows, \"Family Guy\" and \"The Cleveland Show\", \"American Dad!\" does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags, and is less concerned with conventional \"setup-punchline\" jokes, instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters, the relationships between family members, and the relatively relatable plots. The show is not as heavy on pop cultural allusions as MacFarlane's \"Family Guy\", and is more concerned with telling stories while maintaining the integrity and realism of the family members. While the core issues and resolutions are relatable in most episodes, the show nonetheless weaves in fantastical elements, pitching the tone of the show somewhere between observational comedy and farce. The plots are often absurd, but they are grounded by family stories and real-world issues."
