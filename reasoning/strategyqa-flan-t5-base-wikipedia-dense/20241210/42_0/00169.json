        "One of the most famous names in U.S. history is Gomer Pyle. Gomer Pyle was born in 1955 and grew up in Northfield, Missouri. He is now considered a lieutenant by the Marines, who has served as a commander in the Marines from 1967 to 1981. One of the highest honors in U.S. history is the prestigious honor given to the honor of the soldier in the Armed Forces. Therefore, it is recommended for the honor to go to a lieutenant or a lieutenant, with a dedication of service, servicemen's service, and other important issues. Gomer Pyle was a famous U.S. Marine who fought for the Freedom and the Liberation Wars, with a strong record of exemplary military service. On the other hand, the Marines and their loyal support team wanted their country back, and their members wanted to continue the fight against it. Therefore, it is safe to say that Gomer Pyle would not be considered a lieutenant on the basis of his military records. His tenure was based on service and service and is not a way of achieving success."

        "List of Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. characters . Gunnery Sergeant Vincent J. Carter is Gomer's stern, yet soft at heart (as shown in season 3,episode 10 Cold Nose, Warm Heart), drill instructor. He was born and raised on May 4, 1928, in Wichita, Kansas, in a town not far from Leavenworth. Carter takes his role very seriously, as evidenced by the stripes he's earned (and is sometimes obsessed with) over the years. Carter is forever exasperated by Gomer\u2019s ineptitude and refusal to surrender his na\u00efve point of view and would like nothing better than to see Gomer transferred. He is always referred to as \"\"Sergeant\" Carter,\" although under actual U.S. Marine Corps protocol, he would be addressed as \u201c\"Gunnery Sergeant\" Carter\" or the informal \"\"Gunny\" Carter\". In the episode, \"How to Succeed in Farming Without Really Trying,\" Carter does specify his correct rank."
