        "Neanderthals are the late Paleolithic people that lived during the Neolithic period. They did not use arithmetic programming. Thus, they could not have used arithmetic programming. Additionally, they do not have technology to do so, and it is impossible for Neanderthals to use arithmetic. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define what arithmetic means. Arithmetic refers to operations of the mathematical system, such as comparing numbers, determining times, etc. Now, let's consider the Neanderthals. Neanderthals were a group of humans who lived during the Paleolithic period. During the Paleolithic period, they were known for use of primitive devices such as stokers, swords, and spears. Additionally, arithmetic is a mathematical system that was developed primarily for those who viewed mathematics as practical, rather than an integral or functional one. Since the Neanderthals were a primitive civilization, they could not have used arithmetic. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, Neanderthals would not have used arithmetic. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, Neanderthals were an extinct species of humans, specifically Neanderthals. The Neanderthals are known for hunting and hunting animals, which is one of their distinct characteristics. Secondly, while Neanderthals may have been known for using arithmetic reasoning to understand, they are not known to have the ability or knowledge to use it. Therefore, the answer is no, Neanderthals did not use arithmetic. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to find out whether Neanderthals were using arithmetic, which was a mathematics training style of working with numbers. Neanderthals did not have a long history of using mathematics in their hunting or exploration activities. Moreover, it is highly unlikely that they used arithmetic in their hunting and exploration. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Neanderthals did not use arithmetic. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, the Neanderthals were a human race, which means they were hunted down by archers. They may have had some advanced technologies, such as ambush, spears, and arrows, but there is no reason to suggest that Neanderthals did use arithmetic or any other mathematical system. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Paleolithic . Harpoons were invented and used for the first time during the late Middle Paleolithic (\u00a0BP); the invention of these devices brought fish into the human diets, which provided a hedge against starvation and a more abundant food supply. Thanks to their technology and their advanced social structures, Paleolithic groups such as the Neanderthals\u2014who had a Middle Paleolithic level of technology\u2014appear to have hunted large game just as well as Upper Paleolithic modern humans. and the Neanderthals in particular may have likewise hunted with projectile weapons. Nonetheless, Neanderthal use of projectile weapons in hunting occurred very rarely (or perhaps never) and the Neanderthals hunted large game animals mostly by ambushing them and attacking them with m\u00eal\u00e9e weapons such as thrusting spears rather than attacking them from a distance with projectile weapons."
