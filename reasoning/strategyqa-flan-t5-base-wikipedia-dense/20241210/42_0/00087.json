        "First, we need to know what a spontaneous abortion is. This refers to the occurrence if a pregnancy ends before 37 weeks of gestation. Now, let's think about lettuce. Lavender is a type of vegetable that is known to be sweet and juicy. It is known for its lean, ripe appearance and ripe, yellow leaves that are usually green. However, lettuce, which has a dribbling texture like a cucumber, has a low vitamin C content and an irregular nutrient content. While lettuce is sweet and juicy, it is not considered a reproductive vehicle. Instead, it is a vegetable that is likely to cause some disruption or injury due to excessive consumption of the juices and fats that are typically found in processed foods. Therefore, based on the information given in the question, the answer to the question is (A) yes, lettuce can result in a spontaneous abortion. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what the question is asking about lettuce. It is often found in the context of grocery stores, which is not relevant to the question. Secondly, what is a \"spontaneous abortion\"? It is a sprained pregnancy that occurs after a fetus dies in the uterus, and is called a sudden birth abortion. Thirdly, can a sudden birth be considered a spontaneous abortion? Yes, but it's important to understand that this is not necessarily a sprous termination or a quick pregnancy. However, it's possible that even simple or accidental termination of a pregnancy could lead to a spontaneous abortion, and such termination is a spontaneous termination. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, lettuce can result in spontaneous abortion, a term that is commonly known as a spontaneous abortion. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what a spontaneous abortion is. A spontaneous abortion is the eulogy of an egg or fetus ending before the 37th week of gestation. Symptoms include pain, swelling, and nausea. Next, we need to understand what lettuce is. lettuce is a natural vegetable that is typically consumed raw and is not intended for consumption in humans. Therefore, we can conclude that lettuce may present a threat to the reproductive system if it be eaten raw or preserved. Therefore, it is safe to assume that while lettuce is not a potentially dangerous food, it does not result in spontaneous abortion. Hence, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a spontaneous abortion is. A spontaneous abortion, also known as a miscarriage, is the unintentional expulsion of an embryo or fetus before 37 weeks of gestation and when a fetus dies in the uterus. This means that the fetus dies after delivery or during the post-pregnancy period when the pregnancy was considered valid. Now, let's consider the subject of this question, lettuce. Let's assume we are asked about a food that is considered an embryo or fetus, so lettuce could potentially lead to a spontaneous abortion, so we can move on to question option (A) (B) because lettuce can have the potential effect on a person, or the mother's fetus's reproductive success after the pregnancy. Since lettuce can contribute to a spontaneous abortion, the correct answer to this question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what \"spontaneous abortion\" refers to when an embryo or fetus comes into life, before the 24th week of gestation. Then, we need to understand what lettuce is - it is a member of the genus lettuce. Now, as far as we know, a single fetus is born during a given gestation period before pregnancy. So, if we are talking about a spontaneous abortion, then the first thing that we should look at is whether a fetus (for example, lettuce) is also born during the same pregnancy. This means that the fetus is not yet alive, and then the fetus is already being unborn during the time being fertilized. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. In fact, if a fetus is born before birth, or if the baby is still alive during the gestation period before delivery, then the fetus can still be born. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. However, the answer is a yes. Answer: B"

        "Abortion . Spontaneous abortion, also known as miscarriage, is the unintentional expulsion of an embryo or fetus before the 24th week of gestation. A pregnancy that ends before 37 weeks of gestation resulting in a live-born infant is known as a \"premature birth\" or a \"preterm birth\". When a fetus dies in utero after viability, or during delivery, it is usually termed \"stillborn\". Premature births and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap."
