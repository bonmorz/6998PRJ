        "Firstly, cancer patients undergo a number of treatments to address the growth of the cancer, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and radiation. On the other hand, individuals in certain stages of cancer have different needs, abilities, and restrictions compared to others.

It is a condition that is associated with the body's ability to function normally. Based on the definition and scope of Disability in a healthcare context, it is highly likely that cancer patients can suffer from a variety of disabilities, such as spongivitis, neoplasmosis, or some other physical restrictions.

        "Treatment of cancer . There are five different stages of colon cancer, and these five stages all have treatment. Stage 0, is where the patient is required to undergo surgery to remove the polyp (American Cancer Society). Stage 1, depending on the location of the cancer in the colon and lymph nodes, the patient undergoes surgery just like Stage 0. Stage 2 patients undergoes removing nearby lymph nodes, but depending on what the doctor says, the patent might have to undergo chemotherapy after surgery (if the cancer is at higher risk of coming back). Stage 3, is where the cancer has spread all throughout the lymph nodes but not yet to other organs or body parts. When getting to this stage, Surgery is conducted on the colon and lymph nodes, then the doctor orders Chemotherapy (FOLFOX or CapeOx) to treat the colon cancer in the location needed (American Cancer Society). The last a patient can get is Stage 4. Stage 4 patients only undergo surgery it's for the prevention of the cancer, along with pain relief. If the pain continues with these two options then the doctor will recommended radiation therapy. The main treatment is Chemotherapy, due to how aggressive the cancer becomes in this stage not only to the colon but to the lymph nodes."
