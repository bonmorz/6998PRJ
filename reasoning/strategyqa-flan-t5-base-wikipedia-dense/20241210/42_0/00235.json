        "1. The first step is to determine the time period for monkeygoose to breed. Mongoose are known for their ripe yellowing and yellow-brown coloration, while rhinos are known for their gray-hair body shape. 2. A quick internet search reveals that rhinos do not live during their midrangeage. 3. Therefore, the answer is no, monkeygoose did not come from later period than rhinos. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, it is important to know that mongoose and rhino are two small predators that differ in their habitat, with monkeys in particular. Mongoose typically lays their first young in summer and they become nymphalic in the late summer. To compare the two, it is important to note that the time frame is different, so the two species can differ significantly. Therefore, it is impossible to determine which is more extreme than the other. Instead, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we can determine that mongoose and rhinos are a species of sea-life. Mongoose live in the savannah and are usually found in the northern hemisphere in Africa and north-western Asia, while rhinos are found in the northern hemisphere in south and northwestern Europe and south-western Asia. Secondly, we can determine that mongoose and rhinos are not from a longer period of time. Mongoose is a species of wildebeest that occur in Africa, from the winter to summer and the summer. However, they are found in South America and North America, where they live in North America. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, mongoose did not come from later period than rhinos. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to identify the term \"later period\". It is usually referred to as the \"node past\" or \"first time period\" of a species. Now, the question is asking if mongoose came from the later period than rhinos. The answer is yes, as the males will likely grow up to be between 16-20 years old and are fertilized every four to six months before surviving adulthood. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, we can come from the later period than a rhino. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what mongoose and rhinos are. Mongoose are a species of otters that occurs in Australia and South Asia, while rhinos are found in Africa and North America. Mongoose is a type of sea otters that do not have an active reproductive season. They only live in waters that warm, with temperatures reaching down into the 100-100\u00b0 C. Next, we need to consider whether monkeys came from a later period than rhinos. Mongoose do not belong to a particular pre-valence period, because mongoose are found in south eastern Africa, South America, and Central and South America. Mongoose do not arrive in a specific climate region where they live in most environments, so they may come from other periods compared to many other types of marsupians. Lastly, we need to compare the two timelines to find out whether Mongoose came from a later period than rhinos. Mongoose does not come from a specific pre-valance period that rhinos live in. As a result, it is quite possible that Mongoose were born from a later period than rhinos. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A"

        "White-tailed mongoose . Knowledge of the reproduction of the white tailed mongoose is incomplete. Litters are seen most frequently from February to May, and no young appear at all during the dry season from August to November, which suggests that they only breed once a year. The young are fully weaned at nine months of age, and around this time, the young disperse. It is speculated that sexual maturity is reached before two years of age, and that the gestation period is around 60 days."
