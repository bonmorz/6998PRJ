        "First, we need to know the dimensions of the Great Pyramid of Giza. The Great Pyramid of Giza is 77 feet in height and is approximately 180 feet long. Next, we need to know the height of the base of the Great Pyramid of Giza. The height of the base of the Great Pyramid of Giza is 180 feet. Now, let's assume that 200 feet is equal to 180 feet. Hence, 200 feet would be enough to cover the base of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, 200 feet would end to end cover the Great Pyramid of Giza's base. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to define the length of the Great Pyramid of Giza's base. It measures a height of 380 meters and a width of 540 meters. Next, we need to know the maximum length of the Great Pyramid of Giza's base. It ranges from 108 feet (around 550 meters) to 290 feet (approximately 520 meters). Now, we need to calculate the maximum height of a man. The length of the Great Pyramid of Giza is approximately 77 feet. In feet, the height of a man is approximately 1760 feet, which is higher than a man's length. So, can 200 men end to end cover the Great Pyramid of Giza's base? The answer is yes. Since 200 men cannot cover the Great Pyramid of Giza's base, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine the height of Great Pyramid of Giza's base. According to various sources, the height of the base is 280 meters. Next, we need to find the diameter of the Great Pyramid of Giza. According to the official site of the mountain, the height of the base is 440 meters. Now, let's assume that 200 men end to end cover the Great Pyramid of Giza's base. Since this is a bit more realistic, we can say that it is highly unlikely that 200 men end to end cover the base of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine the size of Great Pyramid of Giza's base. According to the official website of the country of Giza, a base surface is defined as a square with a maximum size of 280 cubic feet (0.18 meters) at each end. Next, we need to determine the size of 200 men. According to the official website of the country of Giza, the maximum height of a person ( 280) is the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Now, we need to consider the length of 200 men. The length of 200 men is approximately 2,387 feet (or 328 meters). Since the length of a person's base is such that it is less than 280 cubic feet (or 2 meter), it is impossible for 200 men to end to end the Great Pyramid of Giza's base in one sitting. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, the Great Pyramid of Giza has a base diameter of approximately 330 meters. To cover a base, a male takes around 18 meters and it's only 160 meters. Next, we can calculate the number of men involved in completing the Great Pyramid of Giza's base. Since the base diameter is only 160 meters, 400 men can't use the base diameter to cover the entire Great Pyramid of Giza. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Great Pyramid of Giza . The completed design dimensions, as suggested by Petrie's survey and subsequent studies, are estimated to have originally been 280 Egyptian Royal cubits high by 440 cubits long at each of the four sides of its base. The ratio of the perimeter to height of 1760/280 Egyptian Royal cubits equates to 2\u03c0 to an accuracy of better than 0.05 percent (corresponding to the well-known approximation of \u03c0 as 22/7). Some Egyptologists consider this to have been the result of deliberate design proportion. Verner wrote, \"We can conclude that although the ancient Egyptians could not precisely define the value of \u03c0, in practice they used it\". Petrie, author of \"Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh\" concluded: \"but these relations of areas and of circular ratio are so systematic that we should grant that they were in the builder's design\". Others have argued that the Ancient Egyptians had no concept of pi and would not have thought to encode it in their monuments. They believe that the observed pyramid slope may be based on a simple seked slope choice alone, with no regard to the overall size and proportions of the finished building. In 2013, rolls of papyrus called the Diary of Merer were discovered written by some of those who delivered limestone and other construction materials from Tora to Giza."
