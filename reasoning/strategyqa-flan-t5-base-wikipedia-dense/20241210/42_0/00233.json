        "Firstly, Columbus was a European explorer who took a voyage across the Atlantic Ocean in 1492. It is believed that Columbus sailed from Portugal to the Americas in 1492, but his expedition ended only a year before Columbus. In fact, there are various evidence to suggest that Columbus discovered the Americas early on. Secondly, Columbus' voyage to the American coast and the Atlantic ocean were not considered expeditionary and did not take place during his time. Durian trees did indeed exist at that time, and they were not discovered during Columbus' expedition. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "1. When did Columbus first travel to the continent of America? The 15th century is well within our knowledge as it was a time period during which Christopher Columbus conquered and settled the continent. 2. If Columbus's initial expedition to the continent of America was based in 1578, he would not have been a explorer during his travels there. 3. Since the continent of America was not yet yet established in 1492, it is unlikely that Columbus would have discovered Durian trees during his voyage. 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to consider who Columbus was. Columbus was an American explorer who sailed in 1492, and he is known for his voyages over millions of years. Next, we need to consider what happened during his voyage to the Americas. Columbus, who was an explorer during the 18th century, had not traveled to the Americas before the time of Columbus's voyage. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that he would have discovered Durian trees during his voyage. Hence, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who Columbus was. Columbus was a European explorer who came to America in 1492. Durian trees were a native plant of Asia, a part of the Antilles in Africa and Central Asia. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Columbus would have discovered Durian trees during his 1492 expedition. Hence, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to consider who Christopher Columbus was. Columbus was a European explorer who traveled to the East, specifically through his colony in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. On the other hand, Durian is a plant native to China, which is not currently classified as a landmass. Therefore, assuming that Columbus had been exploring the East, he would have been able to discover trees during his voyage to the Americas during his voyage. Hence, the answer is yes. Answer: A"

        "Maritime history . Christopher Columbus was a navigator and maritime explorer who is one of several historical figures credited as the discoverer of the Americas. It is generally believed that he was born in Genoa, although other theories and possibilities exist. Columbus' voyages across the Atlantic Ocean began a European effort at exploration and colonization of the Western Hemisphere. While history places great significance on his first voyage of 1492, he did not actually reach the mainland until his third voyage in 1498. Likewise, he was not the earliest European explorer to reach the Americas, as there are accounts of European transatlantic contact prior to 1492. Nevertheless, Columbus's voyage came at a critical time of growing national imperialism and economic competition between developing nation states seeking wealth from the establishment of trade routes and colonies. Therefore, the period before 1492 is known as Pre-Columbian."
