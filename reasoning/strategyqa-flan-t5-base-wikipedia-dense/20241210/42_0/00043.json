        "Firstly, we need to understand what dyscalculia is. Dyscalculia is a neurological disorder that affects brain function, primarily affecting mathematics. In general, a person with dyscalculia can't be hired due to a variety of reasons, including a family history of disorders such as learning too much to read or typing, poor memory, and not being able to calculate or digitize numbers. So, we can assume that the question is asking whether a person with dyscalculia would be hired to do surveying work. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what dyscalculia is. Dyscalculia is a neurological disorder that affects brain capacity. It occurs in people with dyscalculia. Secondly, we need to consider what a survey job involves. Surveying is a job played with surveys to conduct interviews. This type of work would require a thorough comprehension of a data problem and an extensive understanding of the data. Finally, we need to consider if anyone with dyscalculia is capable of doing this task. Surveying typically involves surveys. This job requires knowledge, expertise, and skills in the use of data and context. Having an understanding of what surveys involve can help to develop rapport and skills. Based on these factors, we can conclude that hire someone with dyscalculia to do surveying work. The result is likely correct. Answer: A",
        "First, what is dyscalculia? It is a cognitive disorder that affects the ability to work with mathematics. Second, can dyscalculia affect a person's ability to learn math? Yes, some people with dyscalculia may have difficulty understanding numbers. Third, can someone with dyscalculia do surveying work? Yes, but they may also have difficulties with math. Third, can someone with dyscalculia be hired for surveying work? Yes, they may be hired for surveying work, but some people with dyscalculia may not be hired for surveying work. So the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to define what dyscalculia is. Dyscalculia is a condition where the brain's ability to logically know numbers is impaired. Now, let's examine if someone with dyscalculia would be qualified to work in surveying. Surveying is a type of job for individuals who are highly specialized in various disciplines, ranging from clerometry to accounting. So, if someone with dyscalculia is qualified to work in surveying, then the answer would be (B) no, you would not hire someone with dyscalculia to do surveying work. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what dyscalculia is. Dycalculia is a learning disability that affects the functioning of the brain. Next, we need to consider the skills needed to do surveys. Surveying requires a complete set of skills, including basic math and time management. Now, let's look at the skills required to do this job. While surveying requires a thorough knowledge and expertise in math, the question is specifically asking about people with dyscalculia. The correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Educational neuroscience . Neuroimaging studies of mathematical learning disabilities are still rare but dyscalculia is an area of increasing interest for neuroscience researchers. Since different neural mechanisms contribute to different elements of mathematical performance, it may be that children with dyscalculia show variable patterns of abnormality at the brain level. For example, many children with dyscalculia also have dyslexia, and those that do may show different activation of the verbal networks that support maths, while those who have dyscalculia only, may show impairments of the parietal number sense system. Indeed, the few studies carried out on children with dyscalculia only point to a brain level impairment of the number sense system."
