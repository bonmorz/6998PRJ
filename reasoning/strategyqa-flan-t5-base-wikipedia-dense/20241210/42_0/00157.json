        "First, we need to understand what Beauty and the Beast is. It is a story set during the golden age of European folklore. In the story, the beast is the protagonist of a fairy tale named Beauty and the Beast. Next, we need to understand what the collaborators were.

        "Gaston (Beauty and the Beast) . After Katzenberg insisted that development on the film be completely overhauled, the studio ultimately decided to incorporate elements from filmmaker Jean Cocteau's 1946 film adaptation of the fairy tale into their own version of \"Beauty and the Beast\". Gaston, a character who does not exist in the original fairy tale, was among several elements borrowed from the live-action version of the story, based on a character Cocteau himself had created specifically for his film: Avenant, portrayed by French actor Jean Marais who also plays the Beast in a duo role. Similar to Cocteau's addition of Avenant, Gaston was created for the animated adaptation because Disney felt that the story could potentially benefit from a legitimate villain, which the original text lacks, in addition to instilling \"Beauty and the Beast\" with a more prominent element of danger. With Marguerite completely eliminated, Gaston replaced her and ultimately became a more formidable villain. \"Musicals in Film: A Guide to the Genre\" author Thomas S. Hischak observed that Gaston himself had been developed as \"a new kind of Disney villain\" because he is introduced as a harmless, comic individual who gradually changes and evolves into a much more sinister character as the film progresses. With its handsome villain and liberated heroine, both of whom had been developed into fully realized, multi-dimensional characters, finally established, \"Beauty and the Beast\"'s storyline began to solidify. However, some filmmakers continued to contest whether or not Gaston was actually a strong enough villain."
