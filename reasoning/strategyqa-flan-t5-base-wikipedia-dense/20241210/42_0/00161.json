        "Firstly, we need to know the time limit for the Bonanza marathon and WWE Heat marathon to determine the total number of craterathons are in terms of meters, minutes, and hours of sleep. Firstly, we need to know the distance between the two. A quick Internet search suggests that the marathon runs an hour long and includes a half-hour cut, which we need to convert to minutes. So, the total number of the marathons on both lists is around 78 minutes. Secondly, we need to compare the two - there are two types of craterathons that were longer than the marathons on Bonanza. The second craterathon usually ran 71 minutes and had a total length of 42 minutes. The third quater runner-killer lasted only 17 minutes and was just over 100 minutes. Hence, the answer to the question is (B) no - as if the marathons would have ended before the WWE Heat marathon. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine the length of a Bonanza marathon and a WWE Heat marathon. In the first place, Bonanza is usually around 84 hours long. Next, we need to consider the timeframe of each marathon. After one marathon, the next two marathons are usually around 60 minutes long, then it is a total of 69 hours. Now, we can compare the timeline for the Bonanza marathon to the length of the WWE Heat marathon. However, we can also assume that the Bonanza marathon would have lasted longer than the WWE Heat marathon. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, the Bonanza marathon would end before the WWE Heat marathon. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to compare the length of a Bonanza marathon and the length of WWE Heat marathon. Using the diagram shown in the question, we can determine that the question asks if the Bonanza marathon would end before WWE Heat marathon. So, the marathon running at 8am on the day of the event would also end at 5pm on the day of the event. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the question is correct. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what the question asks. The question is asking if WWE HIKE marathon would end before the current season of the show, which is going through a season three in January 2018. Next, we need to consider the timing of the Bonanza marathon and WWE Heat marathon. The marathon is based on a rerun of the season seven episode of \"The Bachelor\" which ended on April 28, 2019. However, the question is asking if the Bonanza marathon would end before the WWE Heat marathon. This is because WWE has a final match on March 18, 2019 in their upcoming season. The Bonanza marathon will run from April 27 - 25 April 2019. It does not make sense that the marathon would end before WWE HINET. Therefore, we cannot make an informed decision on if the Bonanza marathon would end before WWE Heat marathon. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what the Bonanza and WWE Heat marathons are. Bonanza is a television show that aired on NBC in the 1980s. WWE Heat, on the other hand, is a series of television programs that air in multiple languages. Now, we need to compare the two. The Bonanza marathon has started on January 29th in the United States. This means that there are 2 different marathons each day between each show. WWE Heat marathon is a four-hour series of wrestling competition, while Bonanza is a weekly convention that airs around 6:00 pm in the United States. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is (A) yes, because a Bonanza marathon would end before the WWE Heat marathon. Answer: A"

        "Marathon (media) . Marathons have proven to be a viable way of rerunning reality television contests, which have otherwise been relatively difficult to rerun in traditional forms (e.g. daily \"strip\" syndication) because of the loss of the element of surprise. In December 2012, MTV announced that it would air a seven-day (168-hour) marathon of \"Jersey Shore\" before the series finale on December 20, 2012; this marked one of the longest marathons in television history."
