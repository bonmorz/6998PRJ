        "First, we need to establish who Columbus was and where he lived. He was a European explorer and explorer who lived from 1483 to 1803. The Portugu\u00eania was ruled by Portuguese King Xulxia, and he established a trading monopoly in northern and central America. Now, we need to consider the role of the Portuguese Empire. The Portuguese Empire was founded by Spanish governor, Francisco de Luz Henson. It was not a landlocked government but rather a military alliance of Portuguese empires. Based on historical and historical records, it is likely that Columbus had access to funds and other support in order to finance his expedition. There is no historical record or document that suggests that Columbus would have used them to obtain his funding.

        "Mughal emperors . The Mughal Empire (also referred to as Baburid Empire, Baburid Dynasty) was founded by Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, a Timurid prince and ruler from Turan or Turkistan, i.e. Central Asia. Babur was a direct descendant to the Turkic Emperor Tamerlane on his father's side and also had links to Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother\u2019s side. Ousted from his ancestral domains in Turkistan by Sheybani Khan, the 14-year old Prince Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India. The instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun, who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels. Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing West Asian cultural influence in the Mughal court. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun\u2019s triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards. Humayun's son, Akbar, succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India."
