        "First, we need to understand what noise means. Noise can refer to something that is not present or noticeable outside of the scope of the instrument. Next, we need to consider what the term \"finger sounds\" means. When we compare noise level differences between wavelengths, we know that the frequency is the largest and fastest sound source. Therefore, if a frequency of approximately 998 MHz is present inside a telescope, the frequency can be heard. However, if there is a signal on the telescope's main screen that is above 97fff, that is what could potentially be heard. Therefore, the answer is yes, telescopes can hear noise. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what noise is. In electronics, sound is typically caused by electromagnetic waves. Next, we need to understand what telescopes are designed for - they are devices that are used to see and appreciate celestial objects. They are used to look at celestial objects, like stars, stars, and planets. Now, let's consider what noise can do that involves sound. Noise can be caused by other objects, like a lightning noise, noise from lightning strikes, or interference. So, can telescopes directly make noise? If telescopes are designed to see and appreciate celestial objects without any interference? Yes, yes, they can do see noise, as well as other sounds. However, the noise is not generated by the telescope itself or from a direct source such as wind or electrical sources, and can be seen by a variety of different objects or sources of sound. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, telescopes cannot hear noise. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, a telescope is a device used to gather information about the universe and other stars that are directly visible from the outer space. Secondly, noise is generated by sound waves being transmitted to objects and devices within a given range. However, there are some acoustics that contribute to this sound. 3) To answer this question, we need to understand what noise is. Noise is a sound caused by sound waves, such as vibration or vibration due to movement of the object. In this case, we need to determine if telescopes can hear noise. For example, in some cultures, sound waves could be detected through objects that may be detected by other telescopes. Therefore, we can conclude that telescopes can hear noise because noise is caused by acousmic disturbance caused by sound waves. As a result, the correct answer is (A) yes, telescopes can hear noise. Answer: A",
        "First, telescopes are designed to detect the presence of radio signals. However, most telescopes cannot detect any radio signals or other sources. Second, there is no evidence to suggest that such devices detect or communicate with noise. Third, the answer to the question is no, even if there were possible to hear significant noise at a distance from the lightest source. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "- How are telescopes trained? - What are the basics of telescopes used for? - What are optical and nuclear instruments used for? - What are the methods for detecting noise? - Can we study things that are already existing? - Can we analyze if telescopes have the necessary equipment that would allow them to sense noise? - Yes, we can conduct analysis tests to test our understanding of noise. When the object detects noise, it can help to predict the direction and frequency of the sound waves. When you have several instruments and sensors on your telescope, the noise from the camera can help to find the sensitivity of your signal and the type of noise you are detecting. - Yes, we can analyze the noise sources that could potentially cause noise and find ways to mitigate the noise. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, telescopes can hear noise. Answer: A"

        "Noise (radio) . Thermal noise can be made lower by cooling the circuits, but this is only usually worthwhile on radio telescopes. In other applications the limiting noise source depends on the frequency range in use. At low frequencies (longwave or mediumwave) and at high frequencies (shortwave), interference caused by lightning or by nearby electrical impulses in electrical switches, motors, vehicle ignition circuits, computers, and other man-made sources tends to swamp transmissions with thermal noise. These noises are often referred to as static. Atmospheric noise is radio noise caused by natural atmospheric processes, primarily lightning discharges in thunderstorms. At very high frequency and ultra high frequency these sources can still be important, but at a much lower level, such that thermal noise is usually the limiting factor. Cosmic background noise is experienced at frequencies above about 15\u00a0MHz when highly directional antennas are pointed toward the sun or to certain other regions of the sky such as the center of the Milky Way Galaxy."
