        "First, we need to consider the cost of each option. One option costs $86, which is significantly higher than the cost of running for President of India. The question is referring to a recent smartphone, which has a higher cost-of-performance, battery life, and software. Based on this information, it is unlikely that an iPhone 11 would be more expensive than a new one. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define what it means for someone to be President of India to run. Presidents typically have a high-paid governmental or financial status for their country. Next, we need to determine if it is more expensive to run for President of India than to buy a new iPhone 11. To answer the question, we need to compare the cost of two items: 1. a new iPhone 11 - the cost of buying a new one and running for President = 2. Apple's operating system requires more power than an ordinary smartphone, which requires a larger amount of power. 3. In comparison to the cost of a new iPhone 11, it is typically a much greater and less expensive commodity that is significantly higher than the cost of running a President of India. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, it is more expensive to run for President of India than to buy a new iPhone 11 as it involves a higher level of economic or social responsibility. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what is meant by \"more expensive\" by various factors. One of the most expensive statements is \"running for President of India\" or \"buying an iPhone 11\" which means getting a new phone. This implies we need to consider the cost of smartphones and tablets for both candidates. Therefore, we can conclude that it is more expensive to run for President of India than to buy an iPhone 11. The answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what it means to be President of India. The President is a person who serves as a deputy Prime Minister, a politician who represents the government in the country. Then, we can compare the cost of running for president to buying a new iPhone 11 at the most. While the cost of buying a new iPhone 11 is very reasonable, it's more expensive than running for President. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, it is likely that the President of India would receive many awards and promotions over a period of time compared to their regular employer or personal life. Secondly, it's not unusual to have a high income, but it's also known that buying an electronic device can also cost more than running for President. Now, there are a few factors to consider when we run the question. The first factor is the economy, which includes salaries, housing, and utilities. However, it is important to consider that the economy of India tends to be the powerhouse that it is. It's important to note that the average Indian citizen's tax rate in India is around 15% and the average Indian citizen's income is about $18,500. So, while the question is likely accurate, it's not particularly widely heard or commonly cited. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, it is more expensive to run for the President of India than to buy a new iPhone 11 depending on the price, and depending on the particular circumstances. Answer: A"

        "Keepod . One of the main characteristics of Android is it has been created to be lightweight enough to run on the low power hardware of modern smartphones/tablets. The full Android operating system running on a live USB requires approximately 200MB, in contrast to Microsoft's Windows XP which requires approximately 400MB and which no longer receives any security updates from Microsoft. The hardware power of a modern smartphone/tablet can be roughly equivalent to a desktop computer that would have been sold as new several years ago. Because of the trickle down of products from more financially wealthy countries to developing countries such as clothes or electronics, there is potentially a large abundance of low power desktop computers with untapped function, that cannot run the latest versions of a full desktop operating systems, and/or do not have inhabitants with enough financial assets to buy an official full desktop operating system. As a result, more commonly chosen options include pirate desktop operating systems with potential security issues, or buying a somewhat more expensive smartphone - approximately 30.00 USD - for the first time."
