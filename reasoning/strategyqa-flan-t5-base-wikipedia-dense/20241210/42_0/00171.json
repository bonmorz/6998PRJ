        "First, we need to understand what is meant by \"unlucky Friday.\" Friday 13th is a day that falls on a day that occurs twice in the Gregorian calendar. Since a Friday is a day that falls on a day that can occur more than twice in a year, it is safe to assume that the day is also a Friday. Next, we need to consider the year's calendar. According to the calendar, 2015 has twelve days. This means that Friday 13th, April 14th, August 31st, June 3rd, and August 11th will all fall on a day that falls on June 11th. Based on this information, we can conclude that 2015 has more unlucky Fridays than usual. This means that the day is not on a Friday, and the day is considered a Friday. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, 2015. Answer: A",
        "1. Who are unlucky Friday's? This is a question that everyone's familiar with. 2. What is a Friday? A Friday is a day that falls on Friday the 13th of April, which is a day in western Europe that falls on April 13. 3. How does this relate to the question, \"Meanwhile? Here's what we know. 1. What is \"unlucky Friday's\"? It is a day that falls on Thursday, which falls on May 22, while Thursday falls on October 22. 2. Is this not a usual Friday? It is a Friday that occurs on May 25th, which falls on September 22nd. 5. Is 2015 the year? No, 2015 is not the year with the average number of unlucky Friday's. However, since we don't know for certain, we can't say for sure where these unlucky Fridays are. 6. Therefore, the answer to the question is option (A) yes, 2015. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to determine the days of the year in which Friday the 13th occurs. Friday the 13th occurs on every other day in the month of 2015, where as September is the 14th month. Therefore, every year in 2015. Secondly, we need to determine the population for 2015 in relation to Friday the 13th. According to the American Met Office, the population of 2015 increased by 77,000 during the 2017 federal census, which came out in October, 22 of all days. Therefore, for 2015 to have an average of 265 people living, it would have a total of 6249 people living. Therefore, for the year to be 2015, it would have more unlucky Friday's than usual. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, 2015 has more unlucky Friday's than usual. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to understand what is meant by \"unlucky Friday's\" in English. It is a day that occurs when the 13th of February falls on the 13th day of the month, usually occurring on February 13. Now, let's look at the question. The question is asking if there is one day in 2015 when there will not be two Friday's. This means that the number of Friday's in 2015 is higher than the number of Friday's that happen in 2016. Secondly, we need to consider the year in question, which is 2015. Therefore, when we combine these two pieces of information, we get 6 (the year in question) - 1. The question is asking if there are more unlucky Friday's than usual. We would need to use numbers of 1 and 1, and divide by 6, to find out how many Friday's were. 7 of 2016 have 17 Fridays, and 7 of 2015 had 21 Thursdays. These were 4 Thursdays (or more days). Next, we need to look at the year in question. For 2015, there was 17 Fridays, but there were more Thursdays than Fridays, and we could just divide by the number of Thursdays. 7 of 2016 did not have 22 Fridays. Therefore, we can conclude that there are no Fridays with more than usual. Hence, the answer is (A) yes, 2015 has more unlucky Friday's than usual, because this question is more accurate and specific. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what the question is asking. It asks about whether 2015 has more unlucky Friday's than usual. Friday the 13th is a day that falls on a Friday in the Gregorian calendar. As Friday the 13th occurs twice in the calendar year, it occurs at least once every year. Additionally, on Friday the 13th, we have 7 Sundays. After that, the day goes ahead to June 30th, and the first one occurs on Sunday June 31st. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, 2015 has more unlucky Friday's than usual. Answer: A"
