        "First, we need to establish who Boris Johnson was. Boris Johnson was the governor of the United States, serving from 1940-1939. Boris Johnson is a Republican Party member who was born in 1936. So, if we assume that Boris Johnson was a citizen of the United States, they could be eligible to vote in a state election.

        "First, we need to establish who Boris Johnson is. Boris Johnson was the current President of the United States, a person who he sworn in over a year earlier. Next, we need to know who San Antonio is. San Antonio is a city in Texas, and its population is approximately 70,000 people. Now, the question is whether any citizen of San Antonio was allowed to vote in state or national elections. Assuming a citizen of San Antonio is eligible to vote, they cannot vote in elections. This means that they were not allowed to vote in state or local elections. Hence, the answer is \"no,\" as \"yes\" is correct. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to establish who Boris Johnson is. Boris Johnson is the President of the United States, so we can conclude that he was not a citizen of the United States. However, the question is asking whether any citizen of San Antonio could vote for Boris Johnson. The answer is (A) yes. In the past, citizens who were already a citizen have legally voted for them (over the years) to go on to vote. However, in the recent past, the law in question specifically forbids those not living or living in San Antonio from voting. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, regardless of their citizenship status. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand who Boris Johnson is. Boris Johnson was President of the United States, born in 1959. So, the question is asking whether any citizen of San Antonio, regardless of their citizenship or non-citizen status, did vote for Boris Johnson. Therefore, based on what we know, we can conclude that the answer is (B) no, there is no citizen of San Antonio in order to vote. The answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "1. The question asks if any citizen of San Antonio participated in the voting in the US presidential election. 2. We need to know if any citizen who is born in San Antonio is eligible to vote as a citizen. 3. Considering that the question is asking about Boris Johnson, it's not likely that any citizen would have voted in the US presidential election. 4. Additionally, being born in the US means that a non-citizen who did not already have a US citizen or not have any citizenship or non-citizen status in Texas would not have been eligible to vote. 5. So, the answer is (B) no, as there is no citizen who is eligible to vote without exceptions in the election. Answer: B"

        "Right of foreigners to vote in the United States . Since 1996, a federal law has prohibited non-citizens from voting in federal elections, punishing them by fines, imprisonment, inadmissibility, and deportation. Exempt from punishment is any non-citizen who \"reasonably believed at the time of voting (...) that he or she was a citizen of the United States,\" had a parent who is or was a citizen, and began permanently living in the United States before turning 16 years old. The federal law does not prohibit non-citizens from voting in state or local elections, but no state has allowed non-citizens to vote in state elections since Arkansas became the last state to outlaw non-citizen voting in 1926. 11 local governments, 10 of them in Maryland, allow non-citizens to vote in their local elections (Takoma Park, Barnesville, Martin's Additions, Somerset, Chevy Chase Sections 3 and 5, Glen Echo, Garrett Park, Hyattsville, Mount Rainer and Riverdale Park). San Francisco allows noncitizens parents to vote in School Board elections (beginning in 2018)."
