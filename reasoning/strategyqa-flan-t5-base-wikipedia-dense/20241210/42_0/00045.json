        "First, we need to determine the size of an adult black rhino. Black rhinos are a large mammal and their horns are short, with a length of approximately 35-46 inches (over 100-200 grams). Now, let's consider Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a million-dollar actor and a respected tv personality. He is known for his achievements and was a million-dollar movie star. So, if he is able to lift an adult Black rhino, he can perform a routine such as weight transfer and breathing with a distance of at least 6 feet (approximately 80 meters), which translates as an adult Black rhino's body is larger than that of a single human. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a black rhino is. A black rhino is a large mammal that is known for being aggressive and dangerous. Next, we need to know what deadlifting is. Deadlifting refers to the act of lifting something through a needle or a spoon. Now, let's explore the question. Can Arnold Schwarzenegger deadlift a Black rhinoceros? The answer is no, Arnold Schwarzenegger cannot deadlift an adult Black rhinoceros. The reason behind this is that a black rhino is a dangerous animal and when it is taken away, the creature can be killed. However, when it is taken away, it can still be used as a model to create a safer and more effective method for saving the habitat for another animal or human. Additionally, deadlifting is not a method of saving lives and can also do little harm to the species. Lastly, we are asked if Schwarzenegger could safely dielift a Black rhinoceros, so the answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what deadlifting is. Deadlifting refers to deadlifting one's weight between 8 and 16 pounds in weight. Second, we need to know what is meant by \"sheeve\" to describe black rhino. Black rhinoceros are mammal equivalent to lions and have a high-density-than-average weight. They are characterized by their horns and large, hornless body. Third, we need to determine how fast an adult Black rhinoceros is on the scale. To do this, we can look at Schwarzenegger's weight and weight. This means he is still alive and in good physical condition. Black rhinoceros are very small, with a massive trunk, and an average height of only two to three feet. While it is highly unlikely that Schwarzenegger would be able to do so in such a way, it is likely that he would not be able to safely do so. Therefore, it is safe to say that Arnold Schwarzenegger could kill an adult Black rhinoceros if needed. The answer to this question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Schwarzenegger is a well-known actor who is known for directing documentaries on life's troubles and the challenges of a living one. However, there is no evidence to suggest that he has ever deadlifted a black rhino. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know what a deadlift is. A deadlift is a weightlifting exercise that involves lifting one's body weight to the top of the back legs, while the female black rhinoceros, usually weighs between 1.500 and 2500 lbs, can carry a lower body weight and up to 165 pounds in weight. Next, we need to determine the size of an adult Black rhinoceros. A Black rhinoceros is about 1-2.4 meters long, and the weight ranges of the adult one is about 300-500 lbs. Therefore, it is safe to assume that Schwarzenegger can deadlift an adult Black rhinoceros, even if the adult was born and raised averaging a lower body weight. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A"

        "Black rhinoceros . The black rhino has a reputation for being extremely aggressive, and charges readily at perceived threats. They have even been observed to charge tree trunks and termite mounds. Black rhinos will fight each other, and they have the highest rates of mortal combat recorded for any mammal: about 50% of males and 30% of females die from combat-related injuries. Adult rhinos normally have no natural predators, thanks to their imposing size as well as their thick skin and deadly horns. However, adult black rhinos have fallen prey to crocodiles in exceptional circumstances. Calves and, very seldom, small sub-adults may be preyed upon by lions as well."
