        "Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 . Prior to the 2015 Contest, Ireland had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest forty-eight times since its first entry in 1965. Ireland has won the contest a record seven times in total. The country's first win came in 1970, with then-18-year-old Dana winning with \"All Kinds of Everything\". Ireland holds the record for being the only country to win the contest three times in a row (in 1992, 1993 and 1994), as well as having the only three-time winner (Johnny Logan, who won in 1980 as a singer, 1987 as a singer-songwriter, and again in 1992 as a songwriter). For the past four years, Ireland's national final format, Eurosong, had used a mentor system which involved five music professionals being appointed to seek out an artist and song for a televised competition in order to select the Irish entry. In 2011 and 2012, Jedward represented the nation for two consecutive years, managing to qualify to the final both times and achieve Ireland's highest position in the contest since 2000, placing eighth in 2011 with the song \"Lipstick\". However, in 2013, despite managing to qualify to the final, Ryan Dolan and his song \"Only Love Survives\" placed last in the final, while in 2014 Ireland missed the final entirely with Can-Linn featuring Kasey Smith and the song \"Heartbeat\"."
