        "Step 1: Define the Andromeda galaxy. The Andromeda Galaxy, on the other hand, is a constellation with a bright orange center that lies within the Milky Way galaxy. Step 2: Determine if Phobos is part of the Andromeda galaxy. Phobos is a non-living asteroid called Vishwa-parse, which is a large asteroid in the shape of a diamond. Step 3: Test the orbit of Phobos. If it is not a life asteroid, the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy, and its orbit around the Milky Way galaxy, it is not a part of the Andromeda galaxy. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what the Andromeda galaxy is. The Andromeda galaxy is the closest galaxy to the Milky Way galaxy. The spacecraft Phobos has access to the outer space of the galaxy, which is the galaxy where there are various stars and the stars of this galaxy. Phobos, on the other hand, is the largest of the two moons that surround our planet, the Milky Way. Therefore, it is safe to assume that Phobos is part of the Andromeda galaxy. Answer: A",
        "Phobos is a small planet located in the constellation and is not part of the Andromeda galaxy. The Andromeda galaxy is located approximately 6,000 miles from Earth. Therefore, Phobos is not part of the Andromeda galaxy, and therefore the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to identify the constellation that contains Phobos. Phobos is a giant asteroid surrounded by clouds, located approximately 5,700 miles (1,600 kilometers) from Earth. Next, we need to compare these two objects to figure out if they are part of the same galaxy. The answer, by searching the search-for-factions, we find that Phobos is indeed part of the Andromeda Galaxy. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to know what the Andromeda galaxy is. It is a dark and distant galaxy in the Milky Way galaxy, which is situated in the northern region of our solar system. Next, we need to know what Phobos is. Phobos is a dwarf planet that is located in South Pole, Antarctica. It is the largest star in the galaxy and has about 7.7 billion stars in total mass. Next, we need to know what the constellation Phobos is. The Astronomical Journal of the United States reports that Phobos is part of the Andromeda galaxy. It is located in South Pole and has about 7.7 billion stars in its hemisphere and 87 hemisphere. Therefore, Phobos and Andromeda galaxy are not found to have a large population of light. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, Phobos is part of the Andromeda galaxy. Answer: A"

        "Andromeda Galaxy . The Andromeda Galaxy (), also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224, is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs (2.5 million light-years) from Earth, and the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way. Its name stems from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda."
