        "First, we need to know the names of the four names of the Four Horsemen - two are also associated with this phrase. Next, we need to know which one of these names is the best. Since each name starts with the word \"respect,\" we can focus our attention on one. We can see that two of the names of these four names were \"delight\" - three titled \"Tornor\" and a name indicating the name of one \"ispiator.\" Therefore, we can conclude that there were indeed two of the names of \"four horsemen\" - four of the Four Horsemen are also associated with \"eee\" - the name of the famous Four Horsemen. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First of all, we need to know the names of four Horsemen in the \"Four Horsemen\" story. The names of these names are: - A) - B) - A) - B) - A) - B) - D) - E) - D - B) - E - D, O - B, c) - C - O - F - E, O - F, O - F, O - A, G - O - A, O - O",
        "First, we need to know the name of these names. The Four Horsemen are a drink that has four main ingredients: hard liquor, beer, advil, jade, and liquor. Next, we need to know the name of those names. Some items on Pandora's box include items such as gold, jewelry, and other items. In addition, there are several items released within this collection from Pandora. For example, we can find a few items that are named after the \"Four Horsemen\" theme. We can also find a small amount of items that were released in some of these items, such as diamonds, jewelry, and other items that were not shown in the question. These items can be easily found in a quick search engine or even on a computer using a dictionary. Overall, while we can logically determine that items were set up at least two in the Four Horsemen collection, we cannot say for sure whether any were released or not. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a box is. It is a box that holds twelve different items, often from the real world. Next, we need to understand what the Four Horsemen are. Four Horsemen are a cocktail made out of several whiskeys or alcohol, which contain many ingredients that are named after the four horses of the Apocalypse. Based on these definitions, we can conclude that items released from Pandora's box could have been named at least two of the four names of the Four Horsemen. Usually, the question suggests that these items were titled \"Screws and specks,\" which means that items from the box were at least two of the names of the Four Horsemen. So, the correct answer to the question is (A) yes, items were released from Pandora's box at least two of the names of the Four Horsemen. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to understand what is meant by \"named items.\" This may vary depending on the genre of the book or comic, but it is most likely referring to the names of characters in the book, such as the Doctor Who or the King. Secondly, we need to know whether items were released from Pandora's box. It is important to note that the question is asking about items released from the box. This information is likely based on the earliest sources of information in terms of the name or corresponding wording. However, the answer to this question is yes, as it can be concluded that items were released from the box at least two of the names of four of the names of the Four Horsemen, in terms of their names.

        "Four Horsemen (drink) . The Four Horsemen is a cocktail containing four hard liquors and named after the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The name of the drink is derived from the fact that the most common brand names of each ingredient are also male given names and the drinks have a high alcohol content (and therefore tend to have a very strong effect on human physiology). Additionally, the four brand names usually all begin with the letter \"J\" (see sidebar), giving further unity to the concept of the \"Four Horsemen\"."
