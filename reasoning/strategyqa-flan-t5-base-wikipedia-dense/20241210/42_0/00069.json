        "First, we need to consider the cost of a Rowe 550. It can cost around $160,000. Next, we need to consider the distance between the two locations. Rowe 550 is a heavyweight brand of water rowing equipment that is manufactured in Germany for professional purposes. Therefore, it cannot be driven in the same way that a Rowe 550 would to the 2008 Summer Olympics. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, let's consider the size of the Rowe 550. Rowe 550 is a type of electric car used in motor racing, typically used for the road cycling and touring series. Next, let's consider the space required to travel to the 2008 Summer Olympics, which is just over 18 months, and the cost of tickets for the 2008 Summer Olympics to be approximately $10,000. If we consider the seating capacity of the Rowe 550, which are only 82.6 feet tall, it would weigh over 100 kilograms, making it less than the weight of a regular rower. Additionally, the length of a Rowe 550, which is approximately 2.2 m, is much more narrow than the height of a standard rower. Therefore, it is not possible for a Rowe 550 to travel to such a large and expensive expense, and therefore, it would be difficult to fit into the Olympic-type seating arrangement. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is (B) no, it is not possible to drive a Rowe 550 to the 2008 Summer Olympics, as it would take around 168 miles to get between the two cities. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what is meant by \"Autonomic Inflatation\". It is the process of driving a motor vehicle that is capable of accelerating from 0 to 50 mps. Next, we need to understand what is meant by \"seamless\" in terms of reliability. It means that if a motor vehicle is reliable, it is more likely to run in a controlled environment than in low-speed conditions. Next, we need to consider the 2008 Summer Olympics. The Rio 2010 Olympics are open-water kayaking competitions that use specialized kayaks and amolets to perform the tasks of navigating through frozen rivers and lakes. Although it is possible to purchase boats for use at the 2008 Summer Olympics, it is unlikely that you could afford to finance the cost of this vehicle. Therefore, it is possible to drive a rowe 550 to the 2008 Summer Olympics. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to identify what the 2008 Summer Olympics were. The 2008 Summer Olympics were held in Rome, Spain, which means it will be a long distance from the beach to the city center. Next, we need to consider the safety and security features of the 550 Rowe. A 550 Rowe is a low-powered watercraft boat capable of navigating deep waters with great force. The boat is capable of hauling up to 40 tons of weight, and has an impressive weight compared to other forms of watercraft. Since the 550 Rowe can travel up to 252 miles in a single day, it is safe to say that it could not make any actual impact in the environment of the 2008 Summer Olympics. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, you could not drive a 550 Rowe to the 2008 Summer Olympics. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, we need to consider the specifications of the Rowe 550 and the 2008 Summer Olympics. The Rowe 550 is a lightweight, dual-hull, and a capable body size of over 17 inches in length. However, the size of the 550 is not specified in the question as it is not suitable for rowing. Next, we need to consider the availability of fuel at the 2008 Summer Olympics. In 2008, the standard fuel mileage for a conventional-sized rowing boat is around 1,800 liters. Thus, the capacity of a rowing boat would not be suitable for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Therefore, based on these two steps, the answer is (B) no, the boat cannot be used to travel to the 2008 Summer Olympics. Answer: B"

        "Kirsten van der Kolk . Together with Marit van Eupen she participated at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney where they finished in sixth position in the lightweight double sculls. Four years later, they took part in Athens at the 2004 Summer Olympics, where they won the bronze medal. After those Olympics she retired from rowing and gave birth to a child. Less than one year before the 2008 Summer Olympics, she decided to return and became a team again with Marit van Eupen, who had become three times world champion in the non-Olympic lightweight single sculls (LW1x) during the absence of van der Kolk. In 2008, they came second in the Rowing World Cup meeting in Luzern and they qualified themselves for their third Olympics. On 17 August 2008, they won Olympic gold."
