        "The Toronto Star is a newspaper, not an advertisement or any other form of public conduct. It is also not a store that sells newspaper articles or advertisements. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, someone cannot sell their time through the Toronto Star. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define what time is being asked. It is asking if someone can sell their time through the Star. Assuming that someone has left and been released out to the public, we need to search for the Star or any other news outlets that may have the information required to sell their time. To do this, we need to first convert their time to a newspaper or paper format. The Toronto Star, on the other hand, is a social media platform that is available to young adults and individuals with access to information. Therefore, someone can sell their time through the Toronto Star. The best answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to determine what time means. The Toronto Star is a newspaper published in Toronto, Canada. It is a digitized daily newspaper by the government. Secondly, we need to determine the size of their newspaper. According to the Toronto Star, the average paper size is around 98.5 inches or 8.5 feet. While one newspaper can cover a standard size (of 50 mm), a newspaper is not typically the equivalent to a newspaper. Similarly, the size of a newspaper is not typically a crucial factor to determining whether a person can sell their time through the Toronto Star. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, someone cannot sell their time through the Toronto Star. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what \"sales\" means. It is a term used in commerce as a sign of gratitude or thanks for goods in public. Next, we need to consider what the Toronto Star is. The Toronto Star is a newspapers or magazine based in Toronto that publish daily business news. Now, if someone wants to sell their time through the Toronto Star, it would need to engage with the public to sell the newspaper or magazine. When you try to do this, many different people may choose to have their time in the newspaper or magazine. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. To market their time, someone can simply make an investment in the Toronto Star. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what is meant by \"sell their time.\" This definition includes goods or services that sell directly to a customer or who uses them to promote or promote their opinion or products. Next, we need to analyze the value of the Toronto Star. This newspaper has a wide circulation and has high visibility. It is not meant to be a \"seller\" as it is not often sold. This is because a publisher or a publisher may not be interested in being paid by their readership or audience. It is also not a reliable or ethical practice of selling a newspaper through a paper stock or any other business. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, someone can not sell their time through the Toronto Star. Answer: B"

        "White dwarf . White dwarfs were found to be extremely dense soon after their discovery. If a star is in a binary system, as is the case for Sirius B or 40 Eridani B, it is possible to estimate its mass from observations of the binary orbit. This was done for Sirius B by 1910, yielding a mass estimate of 0.94 . (A more modern estimate is 1.00 .) Since hotter bodies radiate more energy than colder ones, a star's surface brightness can be estimated from its effective surface temperature, and that from its spectrum. If the star's distance is known, its absolute (overall) luminosity can also be estimated. From the absolute luminosity and distance, the star's surface area and its radius can be calculated. Reasoning of this sort led to the realization, puzzling to astronomers at the time, that Sirius\u00a0B and 40\u00a0Eridani\u00a0B must be very dense. When Ernst \u00d6pik estimated the density of a number of visual binary stars in 1916, he found that 40 Eridani B had a density of over 25,000 times the Sun's, which was so high that he called it \"impossible\". As Arthur Stanley Eddington put it later in 1927: We learn about the stars by receiving and interpreting the messages which their light brings to us. The message of the Companion of Sirius when it was decoded ran: \"I am composed of material 3,000 times denser than anything you have ever come across; a ton of my material would be a little nugget that you could put in a matchbox.\" What reply can one make to such a message? The reply which most of us made in 1914 was\u2014\"Shut up. Don't talk nonsense.\""
