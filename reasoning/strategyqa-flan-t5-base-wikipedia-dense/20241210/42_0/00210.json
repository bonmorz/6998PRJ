        "First, we need to know who Masaharu Morimoto is. He is a Japanese chef known for his famed \"Senuary Cooking\" franchise. Next, we need to know if he focuses on glutamate. Glutamate is a chemical found in nuts and proteins, which can have harmful health effects like brain damage and neurotoxicity. Therefore, we can say that Masaharu Morimoto does rely on glutamate. Hence, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what glutamic acid is, which is a type of glutamic acid commonly found in glutamate. Glutamate, on the other hand, is a type of metabolite that is found in food, particularly in dairy and fish meats. So, while we may consider the statement that Masaharu Morimoto did rely on glutamic acid, we also need to think about whether he eats or consumes glutamic acid. Based on our current knowledge, we are unsure whether he rely on glutamic acid. However, in the case of Masaharu Morimoto's research into glutamic acid, the answer is (A) yes, he does rely on glutamic acid. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand that Masaharu Morimoto is a Japanese chemist and physician. In Japan, glutamic acid is the primary antioxidant found in foods, including fish, shrimp, and rice. Glutamic acid is responsible for producing various properties such as glutamate, which is an important nutrient in our bodies and immune system. Next, we need to know whether glutamic acid is a substance that can be manipulated to function in his body. The answer is yes. A quick Google search reveals that glutamic acid can be an important nutrient for our body, which can ultimately help improve our eating patterns and immune function. Therefore, based on this information, we can conclude that Masaharu Morimoto rely on glutamic acid. The correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "1. Who is Masaharu Morimoto? He is a Japanese chef. 2. What is glutamic acid? Glutamic acid is a chemical element found in the blood that is essential for the generation of hormones and other molecules in the brain, including chlorophyll, a hormone that helps the body make milk and other substances. 3. Does glutamic acid make the brain function? Yes, glutamic acid is one of the key chemical receptors that can trigger the formation of chemical compounds in the brain that can increase levels of various chemical signals. These molecules can contribute to chemical reactions such as muscle contraction, brain blood gamification, and more. 4. Does Masaharu Morimoto rely on glutamic acid? No, he relies on glutamic acid. While it is clear that he does rely on glutamic acid, there is no evidence to suggest that he does so. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who Masaharu Morimoto is. As of 2021, Masaharu Morimoto is a Japanese chef and chef, famous for his signature Mediterranean style sushi. Next, we need to consider glutamic acid. Glutamic acid is a protein found in many foods that helps to neutralize blood pressure, also known as excitotoxins. One major concern in dietetics is how these nutrients are distributed to the body. However, the majority of people do not have a problem with the levels of glutamic acid. If we consider that glutamic acid, we know that it plays a role in many diets. One possible reason why a person might focus on glutamic acid? This may be due to how they use glutamic acid in their diets. However, this is not a common scientific or medical practice in general that would need much research or scientific knowledge to establish whether or not glutamic acid is a common nutrient in the diets of Japanese citizens. Therefore, the answer to the given question is (B) no, Masaharu Morimoto does not rely on glutamic acid. Answer: B"

        "Glutamate flavoring . Because glutamate is absorbed very quickly in the gastrointestinal tract (unlike glutamic acid-containing proteins in foods), glutamate could spike blood plasma levels of glutamate. Glutamic acid is in a class of chemicals known as excitotoxins, high levels of which have been shown in animal studies to cause damage to areas of the brain unprotected by the blood\u2013brain barrier and that a variety of chronic diseases can arise out of this neurotoxicity. There has been debate among scientists on the significance of these findings since the early 1970s, when John Olney found that high levels of glutamic acid caused damage to the brains of infant mice. The debate is complex and has focused mainly on whether the increase in plasma glutamate levels from typical ingestion levels of glutamate is enough to cause neurotoxicity and on whether humans are susceptible to the neurotoxicity from glutamic acid seen in some animal experiments."
