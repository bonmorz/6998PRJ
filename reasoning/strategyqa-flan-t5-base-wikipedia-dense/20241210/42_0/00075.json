        "Samsung Galaxy A series . The Samsung Galaxy A series' precursor, called the Galaxy Alpha, was introduced on 13 August 2014 and released in September 2014. A high-end device, the Galaxy Alpha is Samsung's first smartphone to incorporate a metallic frame and more premium materials, although the remainder of its physical appearance still resembles previous models such as the Galaxy S5. It also incorporates the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 or Samsung's new Exynos 5430 system-on-chip, which is the first mobile system-on-chip to use a 20 nanometer manufacturing process. However, the Galaxy Alpha received mixed reviews: although praised for its higher quality build and design in comparison to earlier Galaxy models' utilitarian plastic construction, the device was criticized for its modest specifications in comparison to the flagship Galaxy S5, with the Alpha being criticized for lacking water resistance, lower resolution screen (720p versus 1080p), no MicroSD slot for expandable storage, and no removable battery. The Alpha also debuted at a price too high for what some considered to be a \"mid-range\" smartphone, as although it did share the same Snapdragon 801 as the Galaxy S5, most earlier phones with the Snapdragon 801 had already been on the market for months and saw price drops. Following its launch, Samsung Electronics CEO JK Shin explained that the Alpha was \"built and designed based on the specific desires of the consumer market.\" The company touted that the Galaxy Alpha would mark a \"new design approach\" for Samsung's products, and that elements from the Alpha could appear on future Samsung models. Its operating system is based on Android 4.4.4 \"KitKat\" with its own version of TouchWiz UI. Several updates were made throughout the world and in April 2015, Android 5.0.2 \"Lollipop\" was made available through an OTA update."
