        "First, we need to know who Keith Richards is. He is a Canadian actor and singer, best known for his hits such as \"Bobbie\". Next, we need to know what \"Actor of a Boat\" means. In the context of movies, \"Actor of a Boat\" is a movie about a wealthy man and his boat, whose boat is a legendary symbol of the human race's success. It is a classic example of how boat-building and shipbuilding is done with the help of a professional boatbuilder and boatbuilder. Now, let's go back to the question - does the answer to this question be (B) no? Answer: B"

        "Jagger: Rebel, Rock Star, Rambler, Rogue . A culturally astute, often funny, and painstakingly researched read, Jagger offers a far richer portrait than biographies published previously. The book reveals much about his relationships (with Marianne Faithfull and ex-wives Bianca Jagger and Jerry Hall); his complex, creative partnership with Keith Richards; his friends like John Lennon and David Bowie; and enemies like Hells Angels leader Sonny Barger. Spitz goes even deeper, exploring Jagger's many roles: an authentic soul man; powerful social commentator; sexual liberator; would-be movie star; and yes, sometimes, a shrewd businessman with an enthusiasm for much younger women. The myth of Mick is examined and rebooted for the twenty-first century."
