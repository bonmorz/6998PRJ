        "Chlorophyll is a pigment that is a source of light to aid in photosynthesis. So, chlorophyll helps plants to extract and utilize the light for their photosynthesis. However, chlorophyll is a specific pigment that is a requirement for a human race to survive due to lack of chlorophyll. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, human race would not go extinct without chlorophyll. Answer: B",
        "First, we know that chlorophyll is a type of pigment that gives plants their green color, which is also present in green crops. Therefore, it is likely that the human race would not have access to chlorophyll to make their plants green. Next, let's consider the question. We are asking about the human race without chlorophyll. In order to answer the question, we need to know the characteristics and characteristics of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is the dominant ingredient used to color plants green, with chlorophyll providing up to 80% of their natural pigments. Therefore, chlorophyll is essential in the ability of plants to form green algae. Finally, we need to look at what the question is asking. Chlorophyll is not considered to be essential in the natural process of making plants green or even green to human species. Chlorophyll's only function is to help produce green leaves, which the human race lacks. Therefore, it is safe to assume that our answer is (B) no, the human race would not have access to chlorophyll. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what chlorophyll is. Chlorophyll is a pigment that provides green pigments to plants. Chlorophyll is a pigment that helps plants with their green color absorb red and blue wavelengths of light for processing. Next, we need to understand what extinct is. Extinct is the state of emptiness in the body or spirit, where there is no chlorophyll. Therefore, when a human race dies, their body can lose its ability to produce green pigments that are used to extract energy from other sources such as plants. Thus, the answer to this question is (A) yes, a human race would go extinct without chlorophyll. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color. It is the primary pigment in all plants that absorbs sunlight to help protect against ultraviolet rays. Secondly, chlorophyll is not a pigment, it is what makes the green color. However, chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis and can also help plants with a green color when they produce food. Lastly, chlorophyll is essential for promoting nutrition, nutrient, and photosynthesis. Without chlorophyll, the cells would not be able to produce green colors that a human is able to produce. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, human race would not go extinct without chlorophyll. Answer: B",
        "Chlorophyll is a green pigment that is found in plants. Therefore, plants have chlorophyll as their primary source of protein. Chlorophyll is not an essential component of a plant's life cycle. An extra layer of chlorophyll in the plant's diet reduces the growth of the plant's chlorophyll protein, and it has no effect on their survival. Additionally, the chlorophyll protein cannot be consumed or utilized for human food production. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, the human race would go extinct without chlorophyll. Answer: A"

        "Plant physiology . Chlorophyll is the primary pigment in plants; it is a porphyrin that absorbs red and blue wavelengths of light while reflecting green. It is the presence and relative abundance of chlorophyll that gives plants their green color. All land plants and green algae possess two forms of this pigment: chlorophyll \"a\" and chlorophyll \"b\". Kelps, diatoms, and other photosynthetic heterokonts contain chlorophyll \"c\" instead of \"b\", red algae possess chlorophyll \"a\". All chlorophylls serve as the primary means plants use to intercept light to fuel photosynthesis."
