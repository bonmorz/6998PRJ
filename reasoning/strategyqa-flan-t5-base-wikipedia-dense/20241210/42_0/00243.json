        "First, we need to define what lorem ipsum is. This is a term commonly used to describe a type of content that is not needed to convey any kind of meaning or emotion. Therefore, the question is whether a finished website should have lorem ipsum pieces of text. Next, we need to consider the size of the website being referenced. While lorem ipsum is used for a single feature, it cannot be applied if it are not used in a multiple topic or category. Therefore, a finished website can use lorem ipsum paragraphs to show specific content, including graphic design or content, without relying on meaningful content. It can simply be seen as unnecessary because the focus and style of the website should be centered on the type of information it contains and the importance of content. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, a finished website should not have lorem ipsum pieces of text. It's important to use a consistent and organized format to convey any nuances that create an impact on the navigation and overall feel of the website. Answer: B",

Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, a website should have lorem ipsum paragraphs as it shows the content of the website and the appearance of it in a given context. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, lorem ipsum is a placeholder text that serves as a linernote of content. This type of content can be used in the form of writing a text, or the text can be used in the layout of a website, such as when a design is done. Now, the question is asked if a completed website should have lorem ipsum, with the answer (A) yes. As the website is designed to serve as a placeholder text for content that is meant to be displayed in its page layout, the images and text should not compete with or impede the display of the text. The image background and background of a blank page would be displayed too many times, which can harm the viewer. It is important to use original content to create a visual image without relying on content or existing content. Since lorem ipsum can be a source of ambiguity for many users, it would also contribute to the layout of the page and would not show up in the main navigation menu. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
