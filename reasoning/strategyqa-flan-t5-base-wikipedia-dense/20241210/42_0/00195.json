        "Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder where one person eats only small portions but gradually learns to eat and eat more slowly. In contrast, a regular person who is able to handle their calorie intake and stay afloat can also experience significant weight gain.

While anorexia nervosa is a type of eating disorder, it can cause someone with an anorectosis to lose control over their diet and work on their physical strength and overall health.

        "First, we need to understand what anorexia nervosa is. Anorexia nervosa is a mental health disorder where individuals restrict their eating and binge-eating frequency. This disorder can affect one's physical abilities and ability to regulate food intake. Next, we need to consider the bones in an person's body. Bones are typically cartilage units that are responsible for supporting or supporting skeletal structure, such as bone. Without a bone, an individual with Anorexia nervosa will not be able to build strong bone structures, which can help them to function properly. Based on these two steps, we can conclude that a person with Anorexia nervosa would not be more likely to break a bone than a regular person. In summary, while anorexia nervosa may be more likely to break a bone than a regular person who has anorexia, the answer to this question is (A) yes. Answer: A",

Based on this information, it is likely that a person with an anorexia nervosa would be more likely to break a bone than an average regular person. 5. In fact, food is a part of the body and has a lower risk of breaking a bone. 6. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, a person with anorexia nervosa is more likely to break a bone. Answer: B",
        "First, it is important to understand what Anorexia nervosa (ANDR) is.

        "Eating disorder . An eating disorder is a mental disorder defined by abnormal eating habits that negatively affect a person's physical or mental health. They include binge eating disorder where people eat a large amount in a short period of time, anorexia nervosa where people eat very little and thus have a low body weight, bulimia nervosa where people eat a lot and then try to rid themselves of the food, pica where people eat non-food items, rumination disorder where people regurgitate food, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder where people have a lack of interest in food, and a group of other specified feeding or eating disorders. Anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse are common among people with eating disorders. These disorders do not include obesity. The cause of eating disorders is not clear. Both biological and environmental factors appear to play a role. Cultural idealization of thinness is believed to contribute. Eating disorders affect about 12 percent of dancers. Those who have experienced sexual abuse are also more likely to develop eating disorders. Some disorders such as pica and rumination disorder occur more often in people with intellectual disabilities. Only one eating disorder can be diagnosed at a given time. Treatment can be effective for many eating disorders. This typically involves counselling, a proper diet, a normal amount of exercise, and the reduction of efforts to eliminate food. Hospitalization is occasionally needed. Medications may be used to help with some of the associated symptoms. At five years about 70% of people with anorexia and 50% of people with bulimia recover. Recovery from binge eating disorder is less clear and estimated at 20% to 60%. Both anorexia and bulimia increase the risk of death. In the developed world binge eating disorder affects about 1.6% of women and 0.8% of men in a given year. Anorexia affects about 0.4% and bulimia affects about 1.3% of young women in a given year. Up to 4% of women have anorexia, 2% have bulimia, and 2% have binge eating disorder at some point in time. Anorexia and bulimia occur nearly ten times more often in females than males. Typically they begin in late childhood or early adulthood. Rates of other eating disorders are not clear. Rates of eating disorders appear to be lower in less developed countries."
