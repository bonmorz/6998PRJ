        "Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester . Henry's first stroke was in 1965 while he and his wife, Alice, were returning from Winston Churchill's funeral ceremony in their vehicle which resulted in a car crash. This, together with later strokes, left him dependent on a wheelchair, and he was unable to speak in his last remaining years. His last public appearance was at the unveiling of Queen Mary's plaque at Marlborough House in 1967, where he appeared weak and considerably older than the Duke of Windsor. In 1972, the Duke's elder son, Prince William, died in a plane crash. The Duke was in such poor health that his wife hesitated about whether to tell him. She later admitted in her memoirs that she did not, but that he may have learned of their son's death from television coverage."
