        "First, we need to understand what the B's place in the alphabet is. It has the letters B, C, D, H, J, K, U, D, A, R, I, J, O, and S. Now, let's look at Prince Harry's birth order. He was a member of the Royal Family and had one of the British national titles. His birth order was 3rd Duke of Edinburgh, and his birth order was 4th Duke of Wellington, also known as the Great King of England. So, the question is whether Prince Harry's place in the alphabet is the same as Prince Harry's birth order. Since they were both British, the answer is yes, so that is what we know - B's place in the alphabet is not the same as Prince Harry's birth order. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand the order of B's name in alphabet. B is the last letter in the letter E, whereas C is a last name in letter C. Next, we need to know the order of Prince Harry's birth order. Prince Harry was born in 1912 and was born in 1703. This means that their first name is chosen one letter below the other. Now, let's consider whether or not this order is the same as Prince Harry's birth order. Prince Harry had several different birth order, including Princess Harry's name, Queen Victoria's name, and Queen Elizabeth II's name. Therefore, based on the differences in the order of letters and the order of characters, it can be concluded that B's place in alphabet is not the same as Prince Harry's birth order. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "The question is asking if B's place in the alphabet is the same as Prince Harry's birth order. To do so, we need to understand what the alphabet is and what is meant by the letter A. For each letter A in the alphabet, the letter A represents the second letter B (c) and the second letter (d). Now, let's answer the question. The letter A in the alphabet is (B) and the second letter B represents (C). If we were to change the letter A to \"D\", let's look at B's letter A in the alphabet, and see if the second letter A represents the first letter B (C). If the second letter A represents \"D,\" let's look at E's letter B. Since if the first letter B represents \"E,\" let's add \"D,\" \"J\" to E's letter B and we get \"B,\" let's take \"H\" and \"C\" (C). If we like that we can add \"H\" and we get \"W\". If we like that we can add \"P\" and \"J,\" let's take \"P\" and we get \"H.\" We'll end with \"J\" and then we'll get \"P\". Now, we can answer the question based on the fact that there's B's letter A in the alphabet and Prince Harry's birth order compared to the letter A. If we're to change the letter A to the alphabet, let's say, Prince Harry (C) represents the second letter A, and we get \"P\" and \"P\". Then, we can solve the question by comparing it to the letter B in the alphabet, and we get \"B's place in the alphabet\". Hence, the answer to the question is (A) yes, because we can use this information to answer the question, and the letters A, B, C and \"B.\" Answer: A",
        "First, we need to establish what the alphabet is. The A-B-C-D-D-F-C-D-D-F is a nickname for Prince Harry, who lived in 1917. Prince Harry was born in 1821 and his birth name is Edward VIII. Second, we need to determine if the B's place in the alphabet is different from Prince Harry's. Since both B's are given by a substring, we can conclude that \"B\" is not the same as Prince Harry's place in the alphabet. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is B. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know what the order of B's place in the alphabet is. Next, we need to know what Prince Harry's birth order is. Prince Harry was born on June 19, 1915. Therefore, there is a second order of B's place in the alphabet, which goes between B and B. Thus, the answer is (B) No, the place in the alphabet is not the same as Prince Harry's birth order. Answer: B"

        "Collation . The simplest kind of automated collation is based on the numerical codes of the symbols in a character set, such as ASCII coding (or any of its supersets such as Unicode), with the symbols being ordered in increasing numerical order of their codes, and this ordering being extended to strings in accordance with the basic principles of alphabetical ordering (mathematically speaking, lexicographical ordering). So a computer program might treat the characters \"a\", \"b\", \"C\", \"d\", and \"$\" as being ordered \"$\", \"C\", \"a\", \"b\", \"d\" (the corresponding ASCII codes are \"$\" = 36, \"a\" = 97, \"b\" = 98, \"C\" = 67, and \"d\" = 100). Therefore, strings beginning with \"C\", \"M\", or \"Z\" would be sorted before strings with lower-case \"a\", \"b\", etc. This is sometimes called \"ASCIIbetical order\". This deviates from the standard alphabetical order, particularly due to the ordering of capital letters before all lower-case ones (and possibly the treatment of spaces and other non-letter characters). It is therefore often applied with certain alterations, the most obvious being case conversion (often to uppercase, for historical reasons) before comparison of ASCII values."
