        "First, we need to find if we could get an average-below temperature for both species. For example, we can choose a high temperature for both species. Next, we need to look at what temperature for the goldfish and ocean sunfish. It isn't recommended to maintain this temperature unless there are certain conditions that can affect their health. Additionally, if the fish is cold and under the optimal temperature for them, their growth rates will be significantly down. Thus, there is no way to get an entire tank of goldfish and skyfish together in the same tank. Therefore, the answer is (A) no, it would not be possible to keep an ocean sunfish and goldfish in the same tank in the same container. Answer: A",
        "First, you need to know what a goldfish and ocean sunfish are. Goldfish are fish and can be found in oceans and the water cycle is an important part of both. Next, we need to determine what optimum temperature can be kept for a goldfish. Goldfish a type of fish, like a sea bass, prefer cooler waters and can be kept in cold temperatures. Therefore, to determine if it is possible to maintain a goldfish and ocean sunfish in a same tank, we first need to do some research. Since the temperature of the goldfish and goldfish is about equal to the same temperature, it is unlikely that it is possible to keep an ocean sunfish and goldfish in the same tank. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, a sunfish (the ocean fish) is one species of fish, and an ocean goldfish is another species of fish. The goldfish is a small, fish which cannot be kept in a tank with a larger volume of water. Therefore, it would be impossible for an ocean sunfish and a goldfish to be in the same tank in the same temperature. Thus, the correct answer is (A) yes, it would be impossible to keep an ocean sunfish and a goldfish in the same tank in the same size of water. Answer: A",
        "First, an ocean sunfish and a goldfish are marine animals, which means they are more diverse and diverse than common fish. This means they are different parts of the species and some species do not grow in the same environment. Additionally, it is important to maintain the same temperature to keep the temperature low, as ocean sunfish eats more fish than usual. Therefore, if the temperature rises dramatically, it would be impossible for both to survive in the same tank. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to identify what kind of water are typically used for storing an ocean sunfish. Since it is a sea animal, it can usually find water in water bodies of any size, such as oceans, oceans, or oceans. Next, we need to rewrite a scientific sentence that states, \"Do not exceed the temperature of the water and temperatures of the fish or the water.\" Therefore, it is difficult to make the same decision if one other person cannot keep a human sunfish in the same tank. In fact, it is possible to keep both animals separately. However, it is not difficult to assume that any specific individual species of fish can live in the same tank. Based on this information, we can agree that it is unlikely that it could be difficult to keep both animals in the same tank with one person. In fact, one person may want to take a whole ocean sunfish and a goldfish in the same tank for a single time period, in order to avoid the possibility of damaging or harming their aquatic environment. If we can have both fish in separate tanks, we can ensure that the same amount of water in the same tank is maintained at the same temperature. Therefore, it is unlikely that one would be able to keep an ocean sunfish and a goldfish in the same tank. Answer: A"

        "Goldfish . The goldfish is classified as a coldwater fish, and can live in unheated aquaria at a temperature comfortable for humans. However, rapid changes in temperature (for example in an office building in winter when the heat is turned off at night) can kill them, especially if the tank is small. Care must also be taken when adding water, as the new water may be of a different temperature. Temperatures under about are dangerous to fancy varieties, though commons and comets can survive slightly lower temperatures. Extremely high temperatures (over can also harm goldfish. However, higher temperatures may help fight protozoan infestations by accelerating the parasite's life-cycle\u2014thus eliminating it more quickly. The optimum temperature for goldfish is between and ."
