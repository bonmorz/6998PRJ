        "First, we need to understand who Elijah Cummings is. Elijah Cummings is a Christian minister, preacher, and author who served as president of the United States from 2000 to 2003. Now, we need to figure out if we are dealing with two candidates who will have the same views.

After all this information, we can find answers to the question to the question and answer it. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who Elijah Cummings is. Elijah Cummings is a former Republican who is a candidate for the Democratic Party, and we can conclude by comparing Elijah Cummings to Joe Biden, who has been a member of the Republican Party for decades.

After analyzing the candidates in 2016, it is clear that Cummings would be a candidate for Obama in the Democratic Party and that of Obama.

The alternative is to pass the majority of Elijah Cummings\u2019 votes on Election Day. Answer: B",
