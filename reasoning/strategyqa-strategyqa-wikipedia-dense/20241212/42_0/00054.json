        "First of all, it is important to know that the band goes by two commonly used genres: rock and punk music. The band's name is Gorillaz. Now, how does it compare to a different band called Gorillaz? It's based on the same band that formed in 1998. Since Gorillaz is based on musicians, it is possible that it is composed of more members than its previous band. However, it is possible that there are more members who were in their first band. Therefore, there is not any evidence that the band is composed of more members than the suppos for it. Answer: (B) Answer: B",
        "First, the question states that the Gorillaz is an American band formed in 1998. This is a fictional group from the West Germany based band Gorillaz, and does not have any members on the band. This means that the Gorillaz does not have any members on this band as they are not associated with a band that has a bigger following. Therefore, it is possible for the Gorillaz to have an even number of members on this group, ranging from Damon Albarno, who is the original drummer for the Gorillaz. It is not certain, but it is possible that they have additional members on the group compared to the original band. Assuming that the Gorillaz members are not associated with the original band and are all members of the band, it may be possible that the Gorillaz will not have any members at all. The band is also composed of members from a variety of bands. The most important factor that determines if there is an overlap between the two is that the band will have more members or not. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, we know that the Gorillaz were the band with the most members, but they did not have the more than there are. Therefore, the overall question is asking for a precise number of members or members than what they did. The answer is (B) yes, it is a small number of members and the overall question is asking for a precise number of members. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, we need to think of the name Gorillaz. Gorillaz is a Swedish rock band that consists of musicians who live on a different genre of music. Secondly, we need to take a look at the material collected over many years and the amount of material collected. Having been able to identify many people who have contributed to the band, it's reasonable to assume that it's a collective effort created by the band and has been influenced by many elements of the music industry. Lastly, we need to consider the number of members \u2013 a group of musicians able to provide the bulk of the band's music and music. So, the term \"the\" \"gorillaz\" means the \"composites of the members\" for this group of musicians. Therefore, it seems like the Gorillaz has had more members than the current number of members in a group that has been composed of a single or many members. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what \"gorillaz\" means. Gorillaz is a Canadian-American band consisting of four members. Next, we need to understand what it is in terms of a collective or collective composition of various parts of music. It refers to the members of a single member group, typically consisting of a drummer and a bassist who are also members of another band. Next, we need to consider the background of any associated groups in the group. These groups have a much younger culture than the group members, and so it seems like the group is composed of more members than they have. Obviously, if the group members were a solo artist, they may not be able to form a cohesive group. Since these individuals have been each of the members, it is possible that the band members would not be composed together, rather they would have been composed by a group of members from the same club. Regardless of the group's backgrounds, the only way that the group members might have been composed of musicians was if one of them were performing on stage or performed on stage. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B"
