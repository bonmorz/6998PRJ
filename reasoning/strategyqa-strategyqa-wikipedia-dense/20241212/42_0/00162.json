        "Neanderthals were a large group of egypt traders who used firearms to hunt game, and had very advanced technology to create weapons. They also had a variety of weaponry, but not arithmetic. The Neanderthals hunted large game species and were adept at taking and destroying large animals. Nevertheless, they did not use the Neanderthal concept of arithmetic. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, Neanderthals did use arithmetic. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand the history of Neanderthals. They were the Greeks and Romans who fought and played their part in the Paleolithic period of early Earth's development. Specifically, they were known for their archeological skills and unique weapons. Now, if we compare the Neolithic and Middle Paleolithic forms, we can see that Neanderthals were using arithmetic means to eliminate both hominism and ominism during a time period. After comparing the Neolithic and Middle Paleolithic forms, we can determine that Neanderthals were not capable of ominism for many years. Neanderthals were rather common in their history of agriculture and war, specifically in southern Greece and North Europe. Due to their advanced ancestry, it is possible that they used arithmetic as a weapon. While Neanderthals used arithmetic tools, it is unlikely they were able to use them in a practical way. Thus, we can observe that Neanderthals were rarely using arithmetic tools and weaponry. Answer: A",
        "Second, the question is about the Neanderthals. Second, we need to know how their technology and technology can be applied in modern era. Neanderthals were a powerful and advanced civilization with extensive technology, knowledge and understanding. Third, we need to recognize their abilities in mathematical theory as well. As far as projectiles are concerned, Neanderthals specifically had their tools designed to help build a puddle, rather than a projectile weapon. So, Neanderthals did not use any arithmetical techniques or tools for calculating arithmetic. Instead, they used bolds and simple math tools. Thus, Neanderthals did not use arithmetical techniques or tools to calculate arithmetic or calculators. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, when Neanderthals were not hunted in the Paleolithic, they used largely the same weapons they used in hunting. Therefore, according to our analysis, Neanderthals did not use arithmetic technology. Next, we have to consider what arithmetic technology means. It is commonly known to have a number of applications and uses around the world, such as hunting animals. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"yes\" or \"yes\" to the question. Answer: A",
        "1. An arithm is a scientific term that describes a number of factors in the human body. 2. A teddy bear is an example of a physical type that describes the number of insects in the Neanderthal family of origin. 3. Since Neanderthals were not a computer-based arithmetic group, they may have been using arithmetic skills known as arithmetic skills. They may have been using arithmetic skills during their hunter/killer mission, as they are a technology group that utilizes scientific instruments and complex computing abilities. Thus, Neanderthals were not a computer-based arithmical group, and it is unlikely that they would have used teddy bear technology. 4. Since Neanderthals were an arithmetic social group, they may have had no other other tools and advanced skills to help them with their task. 5. The Neanderthals did use arithmetic skills, however, as a technology branch of the Neanderthals, who would have been able to use their technology and sophisticated techniques. Therefore, the answer to the question is not arithmetic, but arithmetic skills were required in a teddy bear. Answer: A"

        "Paleolithic . Harpoons were invented and used for the first time during the late Middle Paleolithic (\u00a0BP); the invention of these devices brought fish into the human diets, which provided a hedge against starvation and a more abundant food supply. Thanks to their technology and their advanced social structures, Paleolithic groups such as the Neanderthals\u2014who had a Middle Paleolithic level of technology\u2014appear to have hunted large game just as well as Upper Paleolithic modern humans. and the Neanderthals in particular may have likewise hunted with projectile weapons. Nonetheless, Neanderthal use of projectile weapons in hunting occurred very rarely (or perhaps never) and the Neanderthals hunted large game animals mostly by ambushing them and attacking them with m\u00eal\u00e9e weapons such as thrusting spears rather than attacking them from a distance with projectile weapons."
