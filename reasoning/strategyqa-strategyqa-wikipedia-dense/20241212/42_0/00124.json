        "Firstly, we need to have debated the question \"whether the 1980 presidential election was won by a member of the Grand Old Party.\" So, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to identify the main party in South Korea. The Grand Old Party was a major party of the late 1980s and was known as the primary to appoint President Lee Myung-bak in the 1980 presidential election. The GNP was the party of South Korea's president. Now we need to identify and ask, did the 1980 presidential election involve someone who is a member of the Grand Old Party? Yes, the 1980 presidential election involved a member of the GNP. It is also known as Kim Young-Sam's party who was the leader of the party. However, the Grand Old Party was not involved. Therefore, the answer is (A) no, the 1980 presidential election was not won by a member of the Grand Old Party. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what the Grand Old Party was during the 1980 election. The Grand Old Party was a political movement that fought for political power in North Korea in the 1920s. This included the Democratic-Republican Party (DPR) and other groups, including Democratic National Party (DNP). Since 1970, it has been known for its victory over the Democratic-Liberan Party, especially in elections during the 1960s. Now, let's consider the question question. The question states if there were a part of the Grand Old Party that had strong influence during the 1980s presidential election. The President, the South Korean President, reevaluated the national political systems and the policies of the country. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what the Grand Old Party was. In 1979, the United Kingdom had two parties: The Grand and the Grand Old Party. Now, let's focus on the 2000 election, which was held on 25 May 1979. We first need to understand who the Grand Old Party was before 1980. The Grand Old Party took office in 1970, when Kim Kyung-nam, a leader of South Korea's major conservative party, was elected President of South Korea. He had been a member of the Grand Old Party before 1980, and the party's successor was President Tae-jung Kim, who had been promoted to the position of Vice President and then removed as President of Japan and became the King of Korea. Originally, the Grand Old Party was a political party that had never existed or had members. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine who the Grand Old Party is, and what it means in the context of the question. The Grand Old Party is a conservative party which consists of a minority majority of Korea's population. It was the first time that a presidential election happened in South Korea in which a member of a major conservative party won the election. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, the 1980 presidential election was won by a member of the Grand Old Party. Since the name of the party used to be the second name for Korean party president Kim Dae-moon, there was no evidence of the name Grand Old Party having been part of South Korea's main political party from the time of its founding. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, the 1980 presidential election was won by a member of the Grand Old Party. The Grand Old Party (GNP) was the party of the same leader, but changed its form. Therefore, the answer is (A) no. Answer: A"

        "Conservatism . South Korea's major conservative party, the Saenuri Party (\uc0c8\ub204\ub9ac\ub2f9), has changed its form throughout its history. First it was the Democratic-Republican Party (1963\u20131980) and its head was Park Chung-hee, who seized power in a 1961 military coup d'\u00e9tat and ruled as an unelected military strongman until his formal election as President in 1963. He was President for 16 years until his assassination on 26 October 1979. The Democratic Justice Party inherited the same ideology as the Democratic-Republican Party. Its head, Chun Doo-hwan, also gained power through a coup and his followers called themselves the Hanahae. The Democratic Justice Party changed its form and acted to suppress the opposition party and to follow the people's demand for direct elections. The party's Roh Tae-woo became the first President who was elected through direct election. The next form of the major conservative party was the Democratic-Liberal Party and again through election its second leader, Kim Young-sam, became the fourteenth President of Korea. When the conservative party was beaten by the opposition party in the general election, it changed its form again to follow the party members' demand for reforms. It became the New Korean Party, but it changed again one year later since the President Kim Young-sam was blamed by the citizen for the International Monetary Fund. It changed its name to Grand National Party (GNP). Since the late Kim Dae-jung assumed the presidency in 1998, GNP had been the opposition party until Lee Myung-bak won the presidential election of 2007."
