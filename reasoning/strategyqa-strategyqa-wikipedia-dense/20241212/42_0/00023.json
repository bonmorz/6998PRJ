        "First, we need to understand who NYC is and where we are going. NYC is a city that is predominantly located in the West End of New York City. Next, we need to understand what euros are. They are the term used for currency used to determine the cost of a currency. To ensure that we can pay for a coffee properly, we use the metro system. It is estimated that NYC is worth around $10 billion in total. Next, we need to look at the cost of a coffee in NYC. If we take a typical cup of coffee from the market to purchase one, it would typically cost around $6.50 for a cup of Starbucks coffee. Since NYC is a central location in New York City, it is also highly regulated, so it would likely be highly priced and inefficient. However, it would be highly unlikely that someone would pay for a coffee in NYC with euros. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) no. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to know if someone in NYC uses euros. The euro is one of the best credit-resort instruments that can be used to cross-border transactions. Next, we need to determine the required amount for making a purchase. For a coffee purchase in NYC, a coffee cost from $7.50 a cup is typically around $2.50. Next, we need to find out if an average dollar is the price of the average person paying for a high quality coffee in NYC. Based on the amount of money we have at our disposal, we can assume that people can pay for a coffee at a higher than average price, with higher prices coming out of companies such as Starbucks, La Maison, or Nest. Next, we need to check if the e-mails are written properly. Considering that a company is likely to pay a higher price in the case of the coffee, we can conclude that the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "1. Who is it who will pay for a coffee in NYC with an euro? It depends on whom you ask. 2. Where do you want to pay for your coffee? You don't want to pay a coffee cost, because it is more likely for a cup of coffee than it is for the cup of coffee. 3. What is the amount that would be paid for a coffee in NYC with an euro? Essentially, you would pay with an a-chip for a dollar. Unless you pay for the coffee and have an e-card (another way, it's called the euro) or have one printed. 5. Who would pay for a coffee in NYC? The answer is (A) yes, someone is asking. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, the correct answer is (A) yes. The Starbucks in NYC has no currency called Euros. Its currency is, in fact, not Euros. So, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "1. You must purchase a coffee from a place with a price tag in the amount of $400.00. This is equal to $1.113, and is not a way to pay for a coffee in NYC with Euros. 2. It is highly unlikely that an order with Euros could have been made to compensate for the fact that the price tag is $40.00. 3. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, someone would pay for a coffee in NYC with Euros. Answer: A"

        "Fair trade . Consumers typically have positive attitudes for products that are ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often are not willing to pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say they would be willing to pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee. Once enough consumers begin purchasing fair trade, companies are more likely to carry fair trade products. Safeway Inc. began carrying fair trade coffee after individual consumers dropped off postcards asking for it."
