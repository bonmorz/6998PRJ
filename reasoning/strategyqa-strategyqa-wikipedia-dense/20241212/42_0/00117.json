        "First, we need to understand who Africanized bees are. They have a strong population of Africanized bees. Next, we need to understand the meaning of multiculturality. Multicultural is the term used for the species that have grown in Africa or Asia. It is often used to refer to a species that has originated in Africa and is currently endangered. Therefore, if we use the term multicultural to refer to an Africanized bee, we can know that there is evidence to suggest that Africanized bees are actually different than European-era or Africanized bees. In this context, the answer is \"yes\" it is. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what is meant by \"Midorism\". Besides being a science fiction genre, africanized bees have also been introduced to multi-cultural cultures including Europe, America, and Africa. Next, we need to consider the characteristics of Africanized bees. Africanized bees are small and have smaller comb-cells than other bees, with less genetics. These larger comb-cells have less genetics and larger wings. Next, we need to consider the physical characteristics of Africanized bees. Some bees are primarily indigenous and are largely smu-sealed. They are typically known for their ancestor, the sexe in which the bees are sexualized. While some bees have a more genital skeleton, they are still highly stodked by a different kind of flower: the white-headed. This is common among Africanized bees, though not all Africanized bees are blue-columbed Africanized bees. Africanized bees are very small, making them hard to detect. They are unable to detect the number of single cells on their wings, as well as the small cells they have. Thus, the correct answer is (A) yes, Africanized bees can be considered multicultural. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand who these bees are. Africanized bees are a group of bees of the African continent who are native to their native-lands. Next, we need to consider what they are like as a result of their ancestorology, their hating traditions, and their genetic makeup. Africanized bees are bees of African origin, so it is necessary for them to have their wings raised and their internal structures on the plant, rather than their heads or heads. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that Africanized bees can be considered multicultural. However, it does require research to identify the relationship between these two species. It is unlikely that Africanized bees will come across as multicultural or as multicultural. Nevertheless, the study of Africanized bees would need to be done using the evidence to help identify who these bees are and whether they do not exist or able to thrive in a multicultural environment. Furthermore, both the research and survey of bee-specific DNA markers (M). I would find that Africanized bees are usually re-defined as species and not natives, although many of them have been found in African waters. Therefore, one could consider that Africanized bees could be considered multi-cultural. Although their characteristics are well-known, Africanized bees are usually a geographically-oriented species, and consequently, they are not a particularly well-know species. Thus, the correct answer is (B) no, Africanized bees cannot be considered multicultural, which would require the correct answer to the question. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what Africanized bees are. Africanized bees are a species of bee species, and they are a species that has different ancestry based on the species you have. The correct answer is (B) no, Africanized bees are not necessarily considered multicultural, and they cannot be considered considered as a multicultural bee. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who Africanized bees are. They are commonly known for having larger wings and a thinner body for smaller wings. Next, we need to understand what a multinational bee is. A multinational bee means a species that is in a particular region of the world or that has a different syringe on its body, not only its wings, but also its ability to travel between syringes and other different areas. Secondly, we can learn what it means to recognize an Africanized bee by its wings. This implies that an Africanized bee is of the most high enthalp, meaning that it is often found in places not far from their home. These bees lack a particular human genetic number, so they do not have a specific genetic delimitation for them. However, these bees do have very strong ability to detect the relative presence of syringes and other different wing types on a human population. They also may have different syringes on their feet and in their eyes, resulting in some bees being hunted differently and avoiding them altogether. Therefore, the answer to the question is likely to be that the answer is no. Africanized bees do not have a unique ancestry or ability to cross country borders, yet they can find anyplace in the world that they can be detected. The answer is no, but there are different populations around the world that could be considered multinational or syringes could be a viable tradeoff. Thus, the correct answer is (A) no, Africanized bees cannot be considered a \"multiplier\" according to the answer. Answer: A"

        "Africanized bee . The popular term \"killer bee\" has only limited scientific meaning today because there is no generally accepted fraction of genetic contribution used to establish a cut-off. Although the native African \"Apis mellifera scutellata\" are smaller, and build smaller comb cells than the European bees, their hybrids are not smaller. Africanized bees have slightly shorter wings, which can only be recognized reliably by performing a statistical analysis on micro-measurements of a substantial sample. One problem with this test is that there are also other subspecies, such as \"Apis mellifera iberiensis\", which have shorter wings. This trait is thought to derive from ancient hybrid haplotypes thought to have links to evolutionary lineages from Africa. Some belong to \"Apis mellifera intermissa\" but others have an indeterminate origin; the \"Egyptian honeybee\" (\"Apis mellifera lamarckii\"), present in small numbers in the southeastern United States, has the same morphology. Currently testing techniques have moved away from external measurements to DNA analysis, but this means the test can only be done by a sophisticated laboratory. Molecular diagnostics using the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b gene can differentiate \"A. m. scutellata\" from other \"A. mellifera\" lineages, though mtDNA only allows one to detect an Africanized colony that has an Africanized queen, and not colonies where a European queen has mated with Africanized drones. A test based on single nucleotide polymorphisms has recently been created to detect Africanized bees based on the proportion of African and European ancestry."
