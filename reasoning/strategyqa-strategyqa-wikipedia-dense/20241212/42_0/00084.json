        "First, we need to define which burger is best for the body. A burger is a flat, fatty-style hamburger made with a beef and tomato combination. Next, we need to consider what a body builder would prefer over an elk burger. A burger is considered a medium-sized food, meaning a large portion with smaller pieces of meat and a little on the side. However, body builders often prefer smaller burgers as a smaller portion and are often a less popular choice. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what an elk burger is. A burger is a hamburger that has three different flavors (dairy, lettuce, sputter, avocados, and mustard) with an oreo cheese glaze. Next, we need to consider whether or not a body builder prefers an elk burger over a burger. This is the question based on a few different factors, including weight, diet, and nutritional values. To correct our differences, a body builder might prefer an elk burger over a burger, however, since an elk burger can also contain meat and contain added nutritional information, such as high fiber. Therefore, in order to answer this question, it is necessary to know that we are talking about a burger and a burger before using a body drive. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) no, a body builder would prefer an elk burger over a burger. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what an elk burger is. An elk burger is a grilled meat patty that has a thick exterior, such as lettuce, tomato, or pickles. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, a body builder would not prefer an elk burger over a beef burger. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to establish what a body builder is and what is a burger. A body builder is a person who generally goes for burgers with a lot of fat or filling, such as fries, and are typically a bodybuilder. If we want a hamburger to be something we can eat but are often tempted to switch out the burger if not the hamburger. Beef is a type of meat found in beef, and it can be easily beaten with some type of bread or soup. Therefore, if a body builder is looking for a burger, it is likely that one of their main features would be a burger. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: A",
        "1. First, we should understand what a body builder is. Secondly, we need to understand what a burger is. 1. Since a burger is a burger, a body builder would prefer a burger that consists of a little bit of meat, like a lot of cheese, and a lot of lettuce, tomato, and pickles. In addition, an elk burger is a burger cooked in a sauce similar to a BBQ sauce. There is no other burger option that has a grilled meat in it. 2. Next, we need to understand what a body builder's lifestyle may be. Traditionally, a body builder would prefer meat in their food and typically choose a burger accompanied by fries or an egg. While a body builder would prefer meats cooked in a homemade hot dog, there is no evidence in any of the answers to the question. Hence, a body builder would prefer a burger in addition to a hot dog, a meal that is arguably more satisfying than a burger. Based on these facts, a body builder would choose a burger versus beef instead of a burger. Answer: A"

        "Whopper . The Whopper is a hamburger, consisting of a flame grilled beef patty, sesame seed bun, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, and sliced onion. Optional ingredients such as American cheese, bacon, mustard, guacamole or jalape\u00f1o peppers may be added upon request. Regional and international condiments include BBQ sauce and salsa. Burger King will also add any condiment it sells upon request, as per its long-standing slogan \"Have It Your Way\". It is available with one, two or three beef patties and in a smaller version called the Whopper Jr, or without meat in a version called the Veggie Whopper. The Australian franchise of Burger King, Hungry Jack's, sells its veggie burger sandwich as the Veggie Whopper. Additionally, Burger King has sold several different promotional varieties throughout the years as limited time offerings (LTO). With the addition of hot dogs to the company's menu in February 2016, Burger King began testing its first major variant called the Whopper Dog in May of the same year across various regions within the United States.
