        "First, we need to understand the alphabet. Since the letter is B, the correct order is \"B\", while the number is B, so B's placement in alphabet is identical to Prince Harry's birth order. So, in theory, the correct order of characters in the alphabet is B, or the same as Prince Harry's birth order. So we can see that the correct order is B, which has two sub-letter values in the alphabet: \"C\" - the first letter is \"B,\" and \"D\" - the second letter is \"A\". Therefore, the correct order of letters to form the alphabet is (B's place in alphabet) at a \"B\". This information should clarify that B's place in alphabet is not the same as Prince Harry's. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what is meant by \"birth order.\" This is basically what a word means, and the answer is (B) \"C\". So, B's place in alphabetical order is B. Therefore, if we can't find the order, which is also a number system in the alphabet, we'll need to go through the alphabetical order. This may sound confusing, but it's true, and it's also true of Prince Harry's birth order. Next, we need to think about the order of letters in the alphabet. The A, B, C, D, M, C, and D are the three letters of the alphabet. However, each is written differently and each consists of more or less than one letter. Thus, the order of letters is different, but it doesn't matter if B is a letter and a vowel, B is an eliopratie in spelling and a vowel in alpha. The other letter is not eliopratie, so there is a difference in spelling, which means it's not the correct alphabet order to us. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, B's place in alphabetical order is similar to Prince Harry's birth order. So, the correct answer is (A) yes, B's place in alphabetical order is the same as Prince Harry's birth order. Answer: A",
        "The letter \"B\" is a letter shaped like a dog or a small cat. A bird is a character whose form is shaped on a rock. The word \"B\" is a single letter of the alphabet given by a letter. Prince Harry was born in 1594. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we know that Prince Harry was born in 1946-47. Next, we know that Prince Harry's name was \"B\". In that name, he also is nicknamed \"Block\" and was born with a letter a-b. Next, we have information about the order in the alphabetical order of the kingdom: Since this is a symbolic order, it can be interpreted to suggest that it is the same as Prince Harry's name. While this is not a valid order, it can be useful to try to explain that the British is also a proper branch to the kingdom of Great Britain, so it is acceptable to consider that the first letter of Prince Harry's name is \"B.\" Since this is a symbolic order, it is likely that the spelling of the order is similarly different. In our answer, the correct answer is A (B)'s place in alphabet also means that the alphabet is the same as the English name \"B\", which is also a simple name meaning that it follows the order of the kingdom of Great Britain. Answer: B",
        "In ancient Roman times, a 'b' - the first letter of the eponymous King Hathrithe-beautifully translates into the '' in a 'B', 'A' and 'C' combinations. In modern times, it is not uncommon for a 'B' character to have the same as ore numeral (orig. b) or a 'A' or 'A' not spelled with the same code. In modern times, it is not necessary to worry about the correcting of the alphabet's order in the eponym, as it is likely the eponymous twirishs, not 'B's 's' re-encoding, and thus the choice question is appropriate to the same problem. The correct answer is (B) no, and the answer is (B) no. The correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Collation . The simplest kind of automated collation is based on the numerical codes of the symbols in a character set, such as ASCII coding (or any of its supersets such as Unicode), with the symbols being ordered in increasing numerical order of their codes, and this ordering being extended to strings in accordance with the basic principles of alphabetical ordering (mathematically speaking, lexicographical ordering). So a computer program might treat the characters \"a\", \"b\", \"C\", \"d\", and \"$\" as being ordered \"$\", \"C\", \"a\", \"b\", \"d\" (the corresponding ASCII codes are \"$\" = 36, \"a\" = 97, \"b\" = 98, \"C\" = 67, and \"d\" = 100). Therefore, strings beginning with \"C\", \"M\", or \"Z\" would be sorted before strings with lower-case \"a\", \"b\", etc. This is sometimes called \"ASCIIbetical order\". This deviates from the standard alphabetical order, particularly due to the ordering of capital letters before all lower-case ones (and possibly the treatment of spaces and other non-letter characters). It is therefore often applied with certain alterations, the most obvious being case conversion (often to uppercase, for historical reasons) before comparison of ASCII values."
