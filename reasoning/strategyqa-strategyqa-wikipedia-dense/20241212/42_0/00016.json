        "First, we need to understand what the \"comedieset\" means. In musicals, the \"stage\" is usually the mainstage, not a stage. Next, we need to consider the number of Broadway musicals or musical theatres that hyenas can appear in. A Broadway musical typically has two to four hyenas: spotted hyenas and regular hyenas. The spotted hyena is a small, sharp-tailed male hyena. Therefore, there are likely to be a number of roles in a Broadway musical - such as auditioning, singing, delivering music, etc. - that requires the presence and singing of a hyena. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, hyenas are present in Broadway musicals. Answer: A",
        "1. What is the term \"forbidden\"? Well, it refers to the act of introducing someone to their place of residence and stating the name of the person or scene of the play or performance. 2. What do hyenas do? They are creatures that come through various places of residences, such as restaurants, museums, bookstores, and other locations. 3. They also have a high flight distance of up to 300 meters in the distance, which is used to travel in extremely difficult weather conditions. 4. What do hyenas do in most musicals? Generally, hyenas are mammals that live in tropical and warm regions of the United States. However, they do have a strong sense of curiosity about human behavior as well as a tendency to find hyenas in their territory. Based on their knowledge of human behavior, and their ability to defend and control people, they would be better equipped to overcome the risk of hyenas, and to ensure that they do not become more aggressive. 5. Are hyenas seen in many musical plays in the US or other countries? Apparently so. However, these animals cannot perform in a musical due to high flight rates and lack of appetite. 6. Does the answer to the question mean that hyenas are also seen in Broadway shows? \"Yes.\" This is important for me, because the answer to this question is different from the answer. Rather than stating a general theory, it is important to consider the fact that the answers to the question could be found in other musicals, so we can confirm that the answer to this is based on common knowledge. Answer: D",
        "First, we need to understand what Broadway musicals are. Broadway musicals tend to be based on musical theater programs or musical theatre festivals, so it is not possible for hyenas to appear in a typical Broadway episode. Next, we need to understand the meaning of a musical production. A musical is a play on musical or theatrical performances, and it is important to understand the music before the audience. First, we need to understand what it means to wear a \"hyena\" clothing. Hyenas can be spotted, a common name used to represent a bird, or a reptile. So, if a Broadway musical is based on a musical centered on a musical that involves a family of animals, then it is considered a musical. Hyenas can also play a significant part in the film and its character is associated with the songs it is performed on, including \"Singing the Song,\" a love musical that involves music, or a dance musical that involves animals with a specific sense of joy. Finally, it is important to note that hyenas are not related to any musical production or production that does have a plot or theme in it. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, hyenas do not appear in a Broadway musical and based on common knowledge. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define what a hyena is. A hyena is a wild animal that has special affinity for birds and hamsters. The hyena is an African lion, but the lion is known to feed on birds, especially puddled and skunk. As we know from research and research, a hyena is a large, large, herbivorous species with a wide range of features that occur from the bushes to the animals. To answer this question, we can consider the following factors: Hyenas are native birds that live in an area in Africa or Asia, while spotted hyenas are native to Africa or the East coast. These factors and other factors, including human activities, make them very vulnerable to predators and can cause harm to people. Additionally, hyenas can be found in deserted areas and have special affinity for insects and insects in the natural environment. The hyena is known to play a role in musicals and other theatre productions, such as The Wizard, The Star Spangled King, The Night Sweep, and Mysterious Beast. In fact, hyenas have been seen appearing in the plays, plays, and other musicals in the last century, and are known for a certain way of communicating their natural behaviors. Interestingly, a spotted hyena, often found in rural areas or in rural areas, also has a special ability and knowledge to communicate the behavior of animals. Thus, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to identify what hyenas are. Hyenas are species that can be distinguished by their large, wingspan. They can be classified as either a prey or a threat. Therefore, we cannot conclude that hyenas appear in a Broadway musical. Hyenas are known for their ability to follow the direction and attack human behavior, but they are not usually able to do so due to their large size. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Spotted hyena . Like most mammalian predators, the spotted hyena is typically shy in the presence of humans, and has the highest flight distance (up to 300 metres) among African carnivores. However, this distance is reduced during the night, when hyenas are known to follow people closely. Although spotted hyenas do prey on humans in modern times, such incidents are rare. However, attacks on humans by spotted hyenas are likely to be underreported. Man-eating spotted hyenas tend to be very large specimens; a pair of man-eating hyenas, responsible for killing 27 people in Mlanje, Malawi, in 1962, were weighed at after being shot. Victims of spotted hyenas tend to be women, children and sick or infirm men, and there are numerous cases of biologists in Africa being forced up trees in order to escape them. Attacks occur most commonly in September, when many people sleep outdoors, and bush fires make the hunting of wild game difficult for hyenas."
