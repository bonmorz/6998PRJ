        "First, we need to understand what chlorophyll is. chlorophyll is a pigment that makes a difference in the color of light and blue, and it helps plants and other ecosystems survive from photosynthesis. Next, we need to understand how Chlorophyll is made and used as a pigment. Chlorophyll is a color pigment that is essential for photosynthesis and helps plants grow to their desired heights. In the greener environment, chlorophyll is more easily seen as a green pigment in plants. Therefore, one may find the answer to question titled \"who would go extinct without chlorophyll?\" Answer: A",
        "First, chlorophyll is the pigment that enables plants to absorb light as they do. However, it does not equate well to the ability for the chlorophyll to produce the receptive light that causes plants to become extinct. Chlorophyll is a chlorotic pigment that combines with green, green, and blue wavelengths of light to create the receptivity for light. Chlorophyll is the major pigment in plants, which indicates the ability for plants to produce oxygen-draining energy. When the chlorophyll becomes toxic, it releases oxygen-draining gas into the cellular arousal which aids in their hyperkinetic ability to survive. This type of energy can be exorbitant, due to its heavy amount of photosynthesis and the lack of light that produces chlorophyll. Therefore, the human race would go extinct without chlorophyll. This is a response to a natural problem in the environmental system which has been created by the chlorophyll's ultraviolet/heated generation process. However, the challenge to kill chlorophyll if chlorophyll is present and allowed by nature could be far too easy since there is no chlorophyll. A solution to the problem is required. With chlorophyll's ability to capture light and transmit it to the cells in the immune system, the chlorophyll can be derived. To achieve a successful reentrification of the chlorophyll pigment, the pigment must be selected from a relatively large array of plants, allowing for greater control in light transfer. Finally, the correct answer is (B) no, the human race would go extinct without chlorophyll. Answer: B",
        "Chlorophyll is a pigment in chlorophyll that is present in plants such as celerus lupinia, celerus averii, and racinondactylenas. This pigment is also called chlorophyllum and a pigment in green algae. The roots in green algae are part of the chlorophyll family. The chlorophyll pigment is responsible for producing spores, while the spores and leaves in chlorophyll are responsible for making plants green. Each cell or spore or leaf has a specific location on the plant and/or leaf. These colors come from chlorophyll, which enables plants to make plants greener and thereby increase their yield. This phenomenon can occur in green algae and other plants, such as green acacias. In addition, plants do not have chlorophylls, which means they are not capable of producing chlorophyll. This makes it a good idea to consider that chlorophyll can potentially prevent human populations from becoming ill owing to poor photosynthesis. Therefore, the answer is yes, except chlorophyll would not survive. Answer: A",
        "1. Chlorophyll is a chlorophyll pigment that absorbs light and gives green to white, a pigment that has the ability to create chlorophyll. 2. However, in the scientific community, the world is based on the concept of human race as defined by the theory of \"exclusion.\" 3. The human race has adapted greatly in the past century to meet the exigencies of our societies to live in harmony with their surroundings, their values, and expectations, and the conditions which they maintain despite their conditions. In their environment, they have lived primarily in the sun, in plants, in animals, and animals, while human and animal society have adapted more to the environment, and has adapted less to the environment than the climate in the past. 4. What do we know about chlorophyll? Chlorophyll is the pigment pigment in plants that has the ability to absorb energy, which allows the human body to thrive, which is, for the very best, a pigment in the flesh. 3. The human race was born with chlorophyll as a defining mineral of our species, which is a vital part of our life cycle. 4. Chlorophyll is the primary pigment used in plants to absorb energy, help the body produce oxygen, and allow chlorophyll to reproduce, thereby contributing to their physical and emotional survival. 5. In Europe, the chlorophyll is a universal pigment that provides light and healing to animals, thus creating a unique and unique pigment that can protect their fragile and healthy balance, thus preventing over-vundant growth in animals. 6. It is widely used throughout the world to treat plants and animals, particularly for their natural and healthy food sources. 7. On the other hand, we are dealing with the topic of \"exclusion.\" The question refers to the practical nature of the phenomenon and their effects on the human race, which is widely accepted, as well as the economic and cultural tensions of many of these species. However, there are no conclusive evidence in support of the argument that the answer is (B) no, the answer could be (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First of all, if chlorophyll were our dietary choice, then the human race would no longer have an entire genetic background, which means we don't even have chlorophyll or chlorophyll. Chromophyll is a pigment that helps stabilize the chemical properties of plants. It's important to note that chlorophyll is the green pigment ingredient used in plants as opposed to chlorophyll. Therefore, it's not possible for an extinct human race to be extinct without chlorophyll. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, but without chlorophyll is likely not true. Answer: A"

        "Plant physiology . Chlorophyll is the primary pigment in plants; it is a porphyrin that absorbs red and blue wavelengths of light while reflecting green. It is the presence and relative abundance of chlorophyll that gives plants their green color. All land plants and green algae possess two forms of this pigment: chlorophyll \"a\" and chlorophyll \"b\". Kelps, diatoms, and other photosynthetic heterokonts contain chlorophyll \"c\" instead of \"b\", red algae possess chlorophyll \"a\". All chlorophylls serve as the primary means plants use to intercept light to fuel photosynthesis."
