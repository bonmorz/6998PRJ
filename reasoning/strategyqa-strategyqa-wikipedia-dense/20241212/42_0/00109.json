        "First, we need to identify the British and the Philippine constitutions. The constitution is the official version of the United States Constitution, which is a book containing laws and principles. Next, we need to examine the British constitution to determine what it contains and what it can be used as a form of constitutional law. The Constitution of the Philippines is a written statement ratcheted up to contain all relevant laws and provisions, including laws, regulations, law, and regulations, on their ratification. It is important to note that the British constitution is not completely similar to its own legislation, which is the Constitution of the United States. It's important to note that it's not the same as the Constitution of the Philippines, which is the official version of the English Constitution. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand the language used in the constitution of the Philippines. The constitution of the Philippines is written in a language with native speakers, as in other contexts such as the national language. Second, the Constitution of the Philippines is a collection of laws and principles that make up the nation's political, legislative, and executive power. The Constitution of the Philippines, on the other hand, is a concept related to the constitution of the United Kingdom. It's a type of legal framework that permits it to incorporate some elements of other cultures, religions, and nationality into a complete constitution. Finally, we must compare the two constitutions on purpose to see that they differ in content and context, meaning that they have different language styles and approaches. It's important to note that there are similarities in different dialects and languages. Therefore, the answer is no, the Constitution of the Philippines does not copy text from the British constitution. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what the British and the Philippines are. The British and the Philippines are a group of countries that hold various constitutional laws and conventions. Next, we need to identify the source of information. This information comes from various sources, including the British and the Philippines Constitution, where the text is found to be based on the laws in the UK. Next, we need to find the information about copyright if the British and the Philippine Constitution are both printed in the same country. Hence, the correct answer to the question is (B) yes, the Constitution of the Philippines can copy text from the British and the Philippine Constitution is in the UK, which is not the case. Since the British and Philippine Constitution have both signed and ratified, these documents will still bear their respective names and terms. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, the Constitution of the Philippines cannot copy the British and the Philippine Constitution. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand where the Constitution of the Philippines stands against the British constitution. It is a list of laws and principles that govern the country. The Constitution of the Philippines was written by the European Constitution in 1615, which enables the British to follow the laws and principles created by the British. Next, we need to identify the source of the text in the British Constitution. The British Constitution primarily relies on the laws and principles that govern the British. So, to answer the question, we would need to refer to the British Constitution, which is a legal form of government that does not distinguish between individuals and the state. Based on this information, it is apparent that the British Constitution did not have text that was not written or based on the Constitution. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, the British Constitution does not copy text from the British Constitution. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand that the constitution of the Philippines and British constitution are two constitutional papers which include the constitution of the United Kingdom, as well as the English constitution and its text. Similarly, the British constitution also contains certain laws that formally set forth the functions of the Parliament and the governmental institutions and structures of the country. Next, we need to consider whether the Constitution of the Philippines or the British constitution are separate from each other in that it is not in the political or administrative structure or policies that vary with the courts and governments. Thus, the Constitution of the Philippines, along with the constitutional amendments, has not been created or codified in the British constitution. Thus, the answer to this question is no. Answer: A"

        "Constitution of the United Kingdom . The United Kingdom does not have one specific constitutional document named as such. Instead, the so-called constitution of the United Kingdom, or British constitution, is a sum of laws and principles that make up the country's body politic. This is sometimes referred to as an \"unwritten\" or uncodified constitution. The British constitution primarily draws from four sources: statute law (laws passed by the legislature), common law (laws established through court judgments), parliamentary conventions, and works of authority. Similar to an entirely written constitution, this sum also concerns both the relationship between the individual and the state and the functioning of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary."
