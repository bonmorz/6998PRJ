        "First of all, ISIS stands for Sunni Islam and Salafi Islam. These two are different Muslim religions. ISIS has a branch in Iraq that is based on Islamic beliefs. Al-Farabi is a group that advocates religious worship and isn't a secular institution. So, it is highly unlikely that ISIS would agree with Al-Farabi's religious/philosophic beliefs and beliefs. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we must understand who ISIS is. ISIS is a jihad group and in a neutral position. Now, we can begin by using a comparison chart, which is available at any number of Islamic websites online. This is a list of Muslim establishments and various institutions in Iran, in which Islamic State believes. It lists their movements and activities across all of the Muslim faiths and traditions. Next we need to consider the definition of Islam, and whether it is accepted or not as a religion. The main concept of Islam is a belief in Allah and His followers. Another concept of Islam is that the followers have a duty or authority over religious beliefs. Therefore, not making any assumptions or statements about the correct meaning of Islam, is irrelevant to these questions. However, if a group has been recognized as an Islamic presence in the Islamic world, it is still not likely that ISIS would agree with the interpretations of Islam. If ISIS had agreed that they are Christian, then it would have been likely that they would have accepted this stance. The correct answer is (A) yes, if this is true or not, ISIS would be in agreement with Al-Farabi's Islamic sect. Answer: A",
        "Al-Farabi's Islamic sect is a type of non-Islamic group that claims to view Muslims as spiritual, moral, and non-judgmental people. It claims to be a separate from ISIS's Islamic government and, by far, is not Islamic or religious. It is also not a sanay state, and its main ideology is the ideology and practice of terrorism. Answer: A",
        "First of all, we need to understand what ISIS and Al-Farabi means. ISIS, or Al-Farabi, are a Shia-based Islamist group. They were Islamic, primarily Islamic and primarily Sunni Islamic. However, ISIS did have a major influence on the Shia-Alawites, a type of movement that would influence the main Shia Islams movement. Therefore, it can be suggested that ISIS would agree with Al-Farabi that they might not be able to operate independently of the Shia Muslim movement. Furthermore, ISIS has not commented on the presence or interpretations of Shia Muslims within their communities. Furthermore, ISIS does not agree with any of them, stating their views as part of the Shia-Sultan movement. Furthermore, the Shia Muslim movement does not support any particular group or religion. Therefore, ISIS's only focus is not on its political activities, rather, it is more focused on their religious beliefs. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what ISIS is. ISIS is a terrorist organization based in Egypt. Originally the group referred to as Islamic State of Iraq, but this term is not used in the Islamic world. Instead, it refers to Islamic State's belief and ideologies. So, while ISIS' ideology is similar to that of al-Farabi's, it is unlikely that it would adhere to its own religious ideology. Therefore, we must check the facts of Islamic State in terms of it's ideology, ideology, and beliefs. Therefore, we can not confirm that it is true of the Christian faith to the extent that it contradicts the belief and belief of the ISIS' religious ideology. However, it is true that it does have its shortcomings, such as its refusal to tolerate Islamic state violence as a way of life for Muslims. However, we can conclude that as the issue of Islamic State's religious ideology grows, so does the response to the question accordingly. The answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant . ISIL is a theocracy, proto-state and a Salafi or Wahhabi group. ISIS considers itself being radical Salafi Islam. Salafi Islam is a strict, puritanical form of Sunni Islam. Muslim organisations like Islamic Networks Group (ING) in America have argued against this interpretation of Islam. ISIS promotes religious violence, and regards Muslims who do not agree with its interpretations as infidels or apostates. According to Hayder al Khoei, ISIL's philosophy is represented by the symbolism in the Black Standard variant of the legendary battle flag of Prophet Muhammad that it has adopted: the flag shows the Seal of Muhammad within a white circle, with the phrase above it, \"There is no god but Allah\". Such symbolism has been said to point to ISIL's belief that it represents the restoration of the caliphate of early Islam, with all the political, religious and eschatological ramifications that this would imply."
