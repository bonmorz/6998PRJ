        "First, we have to understand what a car is and the Audi TT. A car is a vehicle which is a popular car for people who ride a small vehicle. Next, we need to understand what a TT is. A TT is a car or track ride designed for vehicles where the front and rear engines are located and the interior of the car are equipped with two axles. It has a doorway which opens to let the driver and passengers stay in the car while they are in the front of it. Secondly, the answers to this question are likely vague. First, we have to know if any wife of Stone Cold Steve Austin, or any other married person knows of, or would they have known about it? Alternatively, let's just say that, for every spouse of Stone Cold Steve Austin, or any other woman who worked for Stone Cold Steve Austin, they are asking for money to buy the car. On the other hand, we have another question, which is the Audi TT, that a person has a private vehicle, such as a car. It might be a small vehicle, but it could be very useful. Also, we have the information and resources available to help figure out a fit for each wife in the car. In this case, it would not be possible to fit every wife of Stone Cold Steve Austin's car as they were not there and had no way to take the car's front wheel. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "For instance, in order to determine the weight of Stone Cold Steve Austin's wife, you need to weigh in a standard size sedan. However, a sedan can not fit in a narrow space. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, every wife of Stone Cold Steve Austin fits in a Audi TT. Answer: A",
        "The answer to this question is (B) no. The answer is B. Answer: A",
        "The wife of Steve Austin is known for his hard fought performances on the professional wrestling circuit, and he is known for being a serious and well regarded wrestler. The answer to the question is yes, but he cannot run in the Audi TT. When he was at his peak, he was considered one of the greatest wrestlers of his generation. On the other hand, Steve Austin is also known for a strong hand and charisma and is known for delivering a personal focus of excellence and accomplishments in his performance. It is important to note, despite his immense strength in his career, his ability to create dramatic performances has not been proven enough. As a person, he has dedicated his time and energy to his athletes, who he is dedicated to creating those moments of inspiration to challenge and inspire others. Therefore, this is the correct answer to the question, and it is extremely unlikely that Steve Austin would have been able to match his achievements in his career, despite all his hard work and dedication to his personal brand. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what an Audi TT is. An Audi TT is a car that has a width of 132.13 ft in length, and a weight of 1056 kg. So, assuming the vehicle is a model, the body circumference is 490.25 inches (1062.25mm). So, we can say that it's not very large. However, it is also wide enough to comfortably fit into a 966cx1070cc (90kg) weighing at 100kg. And since the cars are made out of steel, they have high weight, whereas the 267cx1070cx10c1070c(40.655cc) and the 128cx1070cc (40.45cc) are a different size than a model of the same class. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes. ( Answer: A) yes. Answer: A"
