        "Firstly, we need to know who is the descendant of the Mongols. We are referring to the Monks who lived in the Egyptian pyramids and are known to have lived in a small part of the pyramid structure. Therefore, the answer is yes, the Wembley Stadium has a descendant of the Mongols who lived in the Egyptian pyramids and also inhabit the surrounding area. Based on this information, we are asking about a packed Wembley stadium, which is the result of a recent survey that indicates that a descendant of the Mongols was found in its area. This may be an indication that the current population of the pyramids may not increase or fall in the region. The Mongols have a varied history and a number of different kingdoms in which they existed. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to look at the number of Mongols. The number of Mongols was around 17,000. Next, we need to look at the current status of the Wembley stadium. It consists of a complex designed in the style of the original Wembley stadium. This means it is likely that Mongols were brought out. Next, we need to determine if there is any chance of seeing an anti-Mongol statue. The statue of Mongols is a large, large statue that would have been placed in the middle of the stadium. Hence, the answer is (A) yes, a statue of a descendant of the Mongols will eventually be included. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, a descendant of the Mongols is a person who was primarily known for their wealth and political influence in the area. In fact, the majority of people in Wembley have had their fortunes from the Roman Empire. Next, we need to consider the capacity of a packed stadium. First, we need to consider the strength of a packed stadium. The capacity of a stadium in terms of number of people in a stadium is less than that of a packed stadium. Therefore, the closest and most important factor to a packed stadium is the capacity of the football pitch or stadium's football team. Since the stadium is often revolved and packed, the population of a packed stadium would increase if given enough time in the future. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what we mean when we refer to the Mongols. The Mongols were a small tribe who lived in ancient Armenia who lived at the time of the English Civil War. They were originally descended from the ancient Roman Empire, and were widely regarded as the great conqueror of the world. It is commonly thought that the Mongols were a noble clan, but they were not known to be in a majority political party and did not occupy the most prominent positions of power in Europe, and the Mongols were known to have fought in many different places during their ancestry. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) yes, a descendant of the Mongols would likely be in a cathedral somewhere else on earth. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to identify the Mongol. The Mongol was a British empire that was known for being peaceful but strong. Second, it is important to examine the current status of the stadium and to evaluate its current state. A full stadium could contain an estimated 2,500 people living in one year, and could be up to 100,000. Therefore, we need to calculate a minimum density of 2,500 hembdenum for the Mongols. Based on this information, we can conclude that we can identify the root cause of the Mongols' existence. In fact, we can determine if the Mongols had any permanent inhabitants in the current building or if the Mongols' existence had been reduced in size. Based on this information, we can calculate that there would be a majority of the Mongols' existence in a full stadium in 2020. Next, we need to consider the current state of the stadium. The Mongols would have been a people known for their peaceful and peaceful activities and have been present at the site for centuries. Since we can determine the current status of the Mongols' existence, we can suggest that it would be up to 100,000 hembdenum for the Mongols in 2020. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B"
