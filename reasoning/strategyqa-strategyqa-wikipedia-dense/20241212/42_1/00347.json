        "Firstly, we can determine what's happening during hanging. In particular, we can look at the physical aspects of hanging. While we're focusing on the core, body limbs and feet aren't covered with a protective skin coating like the squats and heels, or the lower or lower legs. These layers of body part are exposed to contact with which the body can react, making it harder for them to heal or heal or keep being exposed. It can be especially helpful to wear athletic apparel during sporting events like football, basketball, and baseball, in order to keep the body in a healthy condition. Furthermore, we can check for body parts that are being used during hanging and see if there are any changes in the physical components such as blood vessels, and then come back to the body for more protection, such as wearing a protective underwear or protecting limbs during a basketball game. Additionally, while hanging is different than the common causes of hanging, it is not easily spotted or broken. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that there is a connection between the scrotum and the body that may come to play during hanging, and it would be safest to focus on a single aspect during holding a cloth-covered body with gloves and gloves. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand that the question means that you cannot watch a film on the body. If you are hanging on a low-level body structure like a hammock, then it could be a form of activity in which you are trying to engage in physical activity. This can be a risk factor for any motion disturbance, such as a stabbing, twitching or rubbing. Secondly, it is important to consider the position of bodies during hanging, which includes both the scrotum and the chest. To understand whether it would be best to keep your weight at bay, it is important to consider a high level of stress and physical activity (such as high-impact exercise or recreational activities) associated with the production of films in the presence of sunlight or inanimate objects. According to this information, it is clear that a body's ability to operate properly may be compromised by exposure to a body, as well as the exposure itself. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) no, bodies are not causing motion during hanging. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what being pushed or pushed is called. In this context, it is very unlikely that a body would go into this category of punishment as it is intended to do. So, to answer this question, let\u2019s discuss the body. The body is composed of all the muscles in the human body, including the cambie, spine, and joints. Then, we can look at body hair in an interview or on a TV show about a celebrity wearing a mask or cap. They are known to be physically demanding, while the body is immune to the cold. The body of the athlete is not immune to the cold. Consequently, a body does not feel any discomfort and discomfort during a specific action, which is called hang-on. So, there is no harm to the body during hanging when the body hangs. So, the answer is (A) yes, body movies during hanging are not needed for a physical activity. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to know what bodies are and whether this is a physical activity or not. The skin inside the body may contract abnormally, which can lead to a large rash, which can be painful, like burning or rumbling. Next, we need to understand the causes of inflicting pain on the body. Inflicting pain can be a matter for exercise in general, as it can be caused by an accident, such as a fight, or by trauma. During sport, there is also the possibility of a broken hand or arm being damaged through a physical activity. This can be a serious injury, as the body can develop muscle weakness and pain due to injury. Additionally, the muscles in the body usually become dislocated as they age or play during activity, which can lead to a traumatic and painful physical afflict. As with all physical activity, especially when the body is in inflicted or involved in a physical activity, this poses a risk for the body to develop muscle weakness, such as a cut or broken fingernail. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, as it is safe to hang, however it is unlikely to happen during this time period. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to consider the role of a bodily part when hanging and how it reacts to pressure or movement. The most typical body part is the upper back and it doesn't go overboard. In fact, your upper body falls primarily on the lower back while it does horizontal movement of limbs, a form of weight lifting. Lastly, the upper body isn't able to use its motion during hanging because the upper body is directly beneath the lower back. It's too reliant on this type of motion to allow the lower body to operate. Answer: B"

        "Testicular trauma . Because the testes are located within the scrotum, which hangs outside of the body, they do not have the protection of muscles and bones. This makes it easier for a testes to be struck, hit, kicked or crushed, which occurs most often during contact sports. Testicles can be protected by wearing athletic cups during sports."
