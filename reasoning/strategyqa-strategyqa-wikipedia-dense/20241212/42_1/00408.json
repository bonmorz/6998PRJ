        "First, we need to understand what a moustache is. A moustache is a facial hairstyle that involves two vertical layers, one of which is usually attached to the forehead (as the upper lip) versus two in the frontal area (also known as the chin). Next, we need to look at the overall size of a beard. A moustache (feminine or thinly curly) is a type of hairstyle that resembles the larger haired person. It is commonly associated with the development and size of hair in women, which can be referred to as being shaped and/or adjustment, depending on how it is grown or distributed. Likewise, the vellus hair on the upper side of the chin is typically shaped or arranged in a particular way, such as \"smooth\" or \"over-tight\", while on the sides of the chin is often spherical or dark and sometimes asymmetrical (such as \"smooth\" or \"smooth\", as the upper edge of the chin), usually appearing on the bottom of the mouth. However, there may be other factors contributing to the development of a moustache such as a lack of hair or hair loss. Therefore, it is common for women to have moustaches. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what it is called, moustaches. These hairs are found on the facial areas of women, especially the upper or lower jaw and chin. Next, we need to consider the hormones that inhibit the development of facial hairs. While there may be genetic or genetic reasons for this, there may be underlying factors that affect the hair growth process. According to the National Center for Women's Health, there is evidence of women developing the disease for several days, including breast height, body weight, sex and/or hormones, which may have been involved with hair growth. So, the correct answer is (B) no, it is not common for women to have moustaches. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define what is a female facial hair. A female facial hair is one that is exposed or spread through part or whole of a woman's facial hair and leaves noticeable hair on the upper part of their face. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes, it is common for women to have moustaches. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what's required to have a moustache. It is commonly believed to be male, as opposed to female, who can grow longer and fuller (an ozone complexion) and often have longer hair. Now, let's look at common forms of facial hair. The typical short hair-growth period is around 30-60 inches. Therefore, it is common for women to develop a moustache if their hair is very long or too long, as this may have been due to the hormones causing it to increase the number of hair on the body. Specifically, the overall age of a woman is most important and a woman's height (not the individual's height), while the length of a woman's scalp is often more important. Therefore, it is not common for women to have moustaches in all respects. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to define what is common for women. It is common for women to have a beard or a trim facial hair. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, it is not common for women to have a beard. Answer: A"

        "Body hair . It is common for many women to develop a few facial hairs under or around the chin, along the sides of the face (in the area of sideburns), or on the upper lip. These may appear at any age after puberty but are often seen in women after menopause due to decreased levels of estrogen. A darkening of the vellus hair of the upper lip in women is not considered true facial hair, though it is often referred to as a \"moustache\"; the appearance of these dark vellus hairs may be lessened by bleaching. A relatively small number of women are able to grow enough facial hair to have a distinct beard. In some cases, female beard growth is the result of a hormonal imbalance (usually androgen excess), or a rare genetic disorder known as hypertrichosis. Sometimes it is caused by use of anabolic steroids. Cultural pressure leads most women to remove facial hair, as it may be viewed as a social stigma."
