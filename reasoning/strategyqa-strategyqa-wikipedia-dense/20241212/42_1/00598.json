        "In order for the question to be asked, we should consider an objective question with high probability, or not as much certainty. In general terms, it is not clear if we expect to see photos of a particular celebrity being shot or seen in a specific way, so this is unlikely to be a correct answer. While many celebrity photos are taken with sex in mind, they do not include photos of the person, the body or any significant activity that the person may not have done properly. Therefore, our consideration of the fact that these photos would be taken by others would depend on whether or not there is widespread awareness and goodwill amongst the celebrity. This would largely depend on how popular the picture was taken and whether or not a specific image could be captured. Hence, it is important to know that while the picture and image presented in certain ways may not be as valid as it should be, it is likely the picture would have been taken and may be covered in a newspaper and/or magazine advertisement. In light of this, it is not true that the pictures, usually taken with the help of a photographer, should actually be considered as a real picture. Answer: A",
        "Promppency (propriation) refers to a tendency to sultanate by demonstrating certain traits. Prompace occurs when certain sexual traits and attitudes are present or removed from the body. Being aware of these attributes can help define their general nature. Therefore, a more recent time period with a focus on the causes of sexual harassment and abuse is necessary to understand the impact of a certain act. To answer this question, we need to know what poses a threat to society. The answer is \"yes\" and we need to answer the question. A common example of these threats is the emergence of plagues in contemporary times. The majority of modern times sees a prevalence of plagues. For example, in recent times, it is seen as common for all social media sites to engage in violence with celebrities, particularly sex acts such as putting them in their magazine photo albums. One example of this is the use of sex symbolism as an act of inhuman force or influence. In fact, according to media outlets like Twitter, people are actively using these images to express themselves. Therefore, an increased use of the phrase - \"pillages,\" does not necessarily mean being unhyded or unwelcome in the world. Thus, we can assume that these cases may be more dangerous than a common form of assault. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to know how selfies are being used. As we know these things are being used to make people feel more comfortable in themselves while they take selfies and videos on their devices. Now, we have to take this into account. So what does selfie stand for? You can refer to some pictures or videos on the camera where someone poses for a selfie. This is a snapshot of someone taking a selfie. Now, let's think about the question. Do selfies are dangerous? It is based on what we know about celebrities, people, and their experiences in the society that they have shared with them. Are they actually a culpable threat to society? This question is asking if selfies can be used as a means of making a serious or dangerous mistake. Ultimately, selfies may have some consequences and harm to society. Ultimately, since the question is asking whether selfies are more dangerous or worse, it is important to ensure that the answer is yes. Answer: (B) Yes",
        "First, we need to know what selfies are. Hidraits are popularly used in public, for their purpose of expressing sexual feelings or behaviour. Now, let's consider the pros and the cons of a selfie. It's not necessarily an expensive product or video. It's the act of taking a selfie and adding photos to a frame. And you can't see yourself for an extended period of time. A selfie is not considered as an effective tool for people to express themselves and to communicate with their partner or family in a professional or face-to-face situation. It's more effective in order to ensure that your partner isn't seen as a victim of a crime or as a threat to others. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, selfies are not more dangerous than plague, while this is true, not necessarily by any means, and may take years to relapse. Answer: B"

        "Selfie . Many celebrities \u2013 especially sex symbols \u2013 post selfies for their followers on social media, and provocative or otherwise interesting celebrity selfies are the subject of regular press coverage. Some commentators, such as Emma Barnett of \"The Telegraph\", have argued that sexy celebrity selfies (and sexy non-celebrity selfies) can be empowering to the selfie-takers but harmful to women in general as they promote viewing women as sex objects. Actor and avid selfie poster James Franco wrote an op-ed for \"The New York Times\" defending this frequent use of selfies on his Instagram page. Franco defends the self-portrait stating they should not be seen as an egocentric act, but instead a journalistic moment as the selfie \"quickly and easily shows, not tells, how you're feeling, where you are, what you're doing\" in a way that a text communication might fail to convey."
