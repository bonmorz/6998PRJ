        "First, we need to understand what Christmas is. Christmas is a holiday celebrated in England on the first day of the month, thus the correct answer is (B) yes. Now, we can discuss the various festivals. Christmas is an Indian tradition known as the New Year holiday or the Festival of the Dead. As a Christian person, Christmas is celebrated on a Sunday, and is celebrated on that same day. The Festival of the Dead is also celebrated on Sunday, although the festival is also celebrated on Sunday. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) yes, Christmas is always celebrated on a Sunday. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what Christmas is. Christmas is a Christmas season celebrated in the Holy Year, including the Eid - a major Christian holiday in the Christian year of Baptism. Next, we need to understand the concept of a Sunday. It refers to a Sunday (which is a holiday that is celebrated on Christmas Day) with the usual celebrations. During this season, the traditional celebration of Christmas falls on January 9 through January 29 (the first day in January). While that means the christening is already celebrated on January 5 or 6. Additionally, on the Sunday night, Christmas falls on January 16 or February 23 (one of the many holidays that celebrate Christmas). Hence, it is not always celebrated on a Sunday. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. It is clear that Christmas is always celebrated on a Sunday. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what the Christmas season is. Christmas is the holiday season in the Roman Catholic church, based on the Christian tradition. Now, the question is about whether or not it is still celebrated on a Sunday. Christmas is typically celebrated on December 6, and it is not the traditional holiday of the holiday season. Therefore, it is likely that a Sunday celebration of Christmas would be appropriate for Christmas. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) yes, it is not necessarily always celebrated on a Sunday. Answer: B",
        "First, Christmas is a Christian holiday that begins at the beginning of December, followed by the latter quarter of Christmas. Now, I think Christmas is not always celebrated on a Sunday. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "(A) Christmas is the month of the year on which the traditional celebration of the holiday begins. (B) Until the coming of Christ, the holiday is celebrated on the day of the Lord. (C) To celebrate Christ's birth, a Christian would have to start with the holiday of Christmas. This means that Christmas would be celebrated on a Sunday, rather than the holiday of Christmas itself. (B) One thing to consider is that Christmas is considered to be a holy festival which is celebrated on December 25. If Christmas was celebrated on the weekend, it was often observed a day between December 25 and December 23. However, it would not be observed on a Sunday. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, Christmas is always celebrated on a Sunday. Answer: B"

        "Christmas and holiday season . In the Christian tradition the Christmas season is a period \"beginning\" on Christmas Day (December 25). In some churches (e.g. the Anglican Communion) the season continues until the day before the Epiphany, which is celebrated either on January 6 or on the Sunday between January 2 and 8. In other churches (e.g. the Roman Catholic Church) it continues until the feast of the Baptism of the Lord, which falls on the Sunday following the Epiphany, or on the Monday following the Epiphany if the Epiphany is moved to January 7 or 8. If the Epiphany is kept on January 6, the Church of England's use of the term \"Christmas season\" corresponds to the Twelve Days of Christmas, and ends on Twelfth Night."
