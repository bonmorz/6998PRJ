        "First, we need to understand that we are talking about actuaries. Secondly, we are talking about the fact that an actuary is a person who serves as a professional, professional or industry consultant. So, we don't know what prime numbers are. This can't be confirmed but we can say, it's not good news, for anyone who is interested in performing well known services. Thirdly, we can have a discussion about the meaning of prime numbers. In general, prime numbers are numbers that can be used to answer questions for various classes of professional occupations. The definition of prime numbers is essentially the same as prime numbers. They may differ from one actuary's own definition of prime numbers. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "To answer this question, one needs to consider the circumstances in which an actuary works as a legal counsellor or performs legal work. Prime numbers are not typically used in financial, accounting, or legal practice, but they have been used for other professions in various contexts. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, actuaries are not likely to be confused about what prime numbers are. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define what prime numbers are. Prime numbers include: In the USA, people usually hold a fixed number of days with a fixed value. Therefore, it is important that actuaries do not believe that they have a fixed prime number. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, prime numbers refer to a single number of decimals: 32, 33, or 40. Next, we need to determine the size of an actuary's eyes. First, a actuary would have to wear a pair of spectacles for an hour to see their body. A standard actuary weighing a large amount of pounds, it is unlikely that an actuary would want to look at a large piece of data such as this. Therefore, it is logical to assume that an actuary would not be aware of the size of his eyes and the type of face they have. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, an actuary would not be aware of these prime numbers. The question requires three decimal numbers to be correct. Compared to the size of actuaries, which are considered relatively cheap (less than $150,000), it is easier to determine what the correct number is. Accordingly, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to consider who is being shown prim (prime) numbers in a general rule of fact. This rule is used by many actuaries to determine which numbers are correct, as primes are a key determining factor of a number. These numbers can be useful for determining the value of a number. Next, we need to look at prime numbers. Prim (varius 2) is a factor of determinance associated with the number of actuaries on an equal basis and therefore determines which numbers are valid. It can vary based on their relative quality and importance, as these factors can also have a measurable influence over the values, behavior, and motivation of some actuaries. Therefore, actuaries would not consider a number of prime numbers as valid, as all persons with prior experience in the business or general science can find the prime numbers (pries) at one point and compare them to other actuaries, giving an opinion that if they were unable to accurately estimate these numbers, actuaries would not be able to adequately compare them. Hence, the correct answer is (B) no, an actuary would not be confused about what prime numbers are. Answer: B"

        "Actuary . As there are relatively few actuaries in the world compared to other professions, actuaries are in high demand, and are highly paid for the services they render (, ). , in the United States, newly credentialed actuaries on average earn around $100,000 per year, while more experienced actuaries can earn over $150,000 per year . Similarly, survey in the United Kingdom indicated a starting salary for a newly credentialed actuary of about \u00a350,000; actuaries with more experience can earn well in excess of \u00a3100,000 ."
