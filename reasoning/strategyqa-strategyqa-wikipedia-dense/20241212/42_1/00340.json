        "First, we need to understand the meaning of Bonanza. This shows the fictional character from the book of the same name, and it is a satirical version of a traditional musical, characterized by themes such as the Indian wedding dances, marriage, and sexual behavior. This fictional character is often compared with the \"Bonanza\" musical series of the same time period. Next, we need to consider Gandhi's role. Gandhi is a famous Indian singer, poet, poet, and actor who became famous internationally in his music. He played the role of the rich son of the family Electus and Gandhi was a prominent figure in Indian culture, even during his career as an actor and musician. Therefore, based on Gandhi's performances in various different media, we can conclude that not only did Gandhi watch the television show Bonanza, but also that he did also see Gandhi's work on screen, and this would suggest that he must consider and analyze the responsibilities which he faced during his lifetime. Thus, the correct answer is (A) yes, and Gandhi may have watched the television show Bonanza. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what the television show Bonanza is. Bonanza is an American TV series that ran from 1959 to 1973. Next, we need to determine if Gandhi has watched the show. In the 1960s, Gandhi was a man who believed in religious and spiritualism. In the 1970s, Gandhi did not do this, but he was very religious. Therefore, the answer to this question is \"No\". The answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, Gandhi was a prominent Jewish individual who advocated freedom for the African-American community in the 1960s. This was a very important time for the Arab-American community and the movement. To which he replied that Gandhi and his supporters had remained close in relation to each other. Gandhi, on the other hand, is a leading and highly controversial figure in the Western Civilization, particularly in the Indian sub-culture of the early 20th century. These groups are often depicted as resentments for their own ideologies, which can be considered a form of \"black pride.\" Given Gandhi's stance of liberal politics, the question may be difficult to answer. This is because Gandhi did not agree with the views of the West, and had a different view of his views, which can be interpreted as either \"white pride\" or \"paintingly racist.\" An example of this statement would be to say, did Gandhi have a similar perspective? Clearly, he had not seen Gandhi, which is very hard to understand. The difference between Gandhi and his position, however, is not related to Gandhi's views, which may vary. The question might be a question of religion or a moral argument, as there is no evidence for either. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to identify the show Bonanza, which is a popular television series that was produced by NBC. Next, we need to determine what happened with Gandhi. According to Indian tradition, Gandhi was a controversial and controversial figure who had taken up political views in the 1970s and 1980s. When Gandhi took up the political issue, he publicly said that he had never seen a television show like the one he was on. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "The first and only question to answer is whether Gandhi would have watched the television show Bonanza. It is, of course, not the final episode of the series that became popular for television broadcasts. Next, we need to question the history of the show Bonanza. The TV show Bonanza was only in theaters, not on television shows or on movies. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, Gandhi did not watch the television show Bonanza. The answer is B1 which is correct. Answer: B"
