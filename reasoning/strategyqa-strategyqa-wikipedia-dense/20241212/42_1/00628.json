        "First, it's true that Tony Bennett's wife was the first female screenwriter to do so. Next, it's not a mystery who Tony Bennett had children with. There is no evidence that he has any more children than his spouse, as it's likely that they died off the inside of the family as they're still alive and having their sex. Second, it's unclear whether Tony Bennett had more children than his wife, although he did have a lot of women in his life, including his wife, who died around the time Tony has been a screenwriter. As a result, the correct answer to the question is (A) no, Tony Bennett had more children than his wife, although he could have carried out a lot of acting as a screenwriter, even though they were in different parts of their life. Answer: A",
        "Based on the information given, a husband has a significant relationship with his wife. Additionally, Tony Bennett lived with his two children in 1908. Therefore, it is important to note that he also had several children other than his wife. The other two children in his marriage include his mother's, brother's, and wife's. However, Tony Bennett did not have as many children as his wife did, even if it were all but the death of his wife. In fact, the family was still very young when he did lose his wife. Therefore, Tony Bennett did not have as many children as his wife and himself. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine Tony Bennett's biological lineage. Initially, the biological lineage theory was used to help elucidate the difference in genders between the two ancesantes. There were only 3 main men, a few females who were married between 1789 and 1792. It may be possible that Tony Bennett would have had more children than his wife if he had one or two women of equal rank, or that he had a more diverse mix of wives or couples. However, some of these women were not physically related to Tony Bennett, who was very young, unable to express himself as a musician. Therefore, one can only confirm his marriage with a different background, and it is possible that he had more children than he had. Lastly, we need to determine the historical and current status of Tony Bennett as a person. The facts and history of the family suggest that his younger son was not Tony Bennett's biological wife or any male person in his life, and this is because the prevailing political views on his marriage were the most likely to support his views. It is important to consider his historical or current age in terms of his marriage, since he was a famous songwriter and actor, as well as any other person whom he married. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, Tony Bennett had more children than his wives, who were not physically related to Tony Bennett or his wife. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to question what Tony Bennett actually had compared to his parents. He had several wives, many of whom were also his wives. Next, we need to compare his son's marriage to his wives' children. Their husbands were also Tony Bennett's husband, the former wife of the latter's former wife, Emma. The former was married to his former boyfriend, Joseph Smith, and they both had children. The latter married himself. After discussing the issue, we can conclude that Tony Bennett had more children than his wives, and therefore it is probable that the same person could have more children. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, Tony Bennett had more children than his wives. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to determine who Tony Bennett is and when he got married. It is believed that Tony Bennett made his first husband in the 1970s, but he did not have any children after that. Next, we need to determine how many households did he have. In fact, he had 5 wives, while Benson was also considered the oldest surviving wife. Another fact is that Bennett was more than half his parents' average number of children. His mother was also the first wife of Bennett and he still had two wives, ranging in age from 5 to 11. On the other hand, Bennett's husband was not very wealthy and was married to a number of women. So, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Teachings of Joseph Smith . Although it has been alleged that Smith may have had children by his wives other than Emma (most historians believe he married at least thirty-three women, and probably as many as forty-eight), DNA investigations in three cases have established that their biological fathers were Smith's wives' other husbands. The DNA research, so far, has failed to confirm Smith's paternity for any children other than those borne by his legal spouse, Emma."
