        "Firstly, Ice is not a powerful, physical form that can be used for commercial purposes or make people rich. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Ice is an ice that is produced from melted ice, which makes it a commodity in the United States. However, there is no evidence for this to prove that ice can make people rich. The evidence is based on the widespread use of ice over the past century. It has been used as a model for a variety of factors, including smog and urban ice usage. However, it has also been shown that people lose or eat it all when it is too cold to be used in public. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First of all, we need to understand what it means to make people rich. Ice is a form of cold, dry ground that creates ice cream in a form of icecream. We can find the answer to the question 'Does Ice make people rich' by looking at the following: 1. Answer: a",
        "First, we need to understand what ice is. Ice is a synthetic substance, typically made by ice crystals, which are ice-based products. It is a material that is easily transported through transportation systems, buildings and other structures. It is often found in cities, as consumers use it to create a solid currency and pay as much as possible. Second, we can look at what the economic crisis in South America were. During the Cold War, the ice melted rapidly, thus causing major economic collapses, especially in the U.S. In the United Kingdom, ice was thriving in the 1950s and early 30s, helping to ease down Britain's economic collapse. Third, we need to consider the economy of this question. What makes it so far more difficult to live in a global economy? There was a significant number of people in the UK during the Depression who found themselves in extreme need of ice, while many of them opted to live in areas with less ice. Fourth, many people who remained in the world long during the Depression were at the bottom of the population due to the severe economic depression and unemployment. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, Ice made people rich. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what Ice is. Ice is an ice mineral in Antarctica. Next, we need to consider the history of the industry, as it was not very plentiful. Therefore, to answer the question, this requires that a person understand what ice is and what it do to create wealth. It is not possible that the ice industry had its way when it was invented. Secondly, we need to define the role of the ice industry and how it was invented and produced. Ice is an ice industry created by ice workers, the ice production industry, the economic value of ice in the ice industry, and the economic value of economic competition. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A"

        "Ice famine . The ice market boomed and ice was being transported from anywhere possible to many cities in the United States. New York City and Chicago were major consumers of American ice because there were higher densities of people and businesses that heavily relied on ice. But many problems arose from the relatively new industry that did not have the best technology to ensure a sufficient supply and that wasted much of the ice during the transportation process. Since the demand for ice was so high in nearly all of the United States, any delay or shortage in supply threatened the people with an ice famine. Some of the main causes of ice famines were unreliable trains as modes of transport, ever increasing prices, and unfavorable weather conditions. Unfortunately, the people who controlled the ice supply in America could not control every variable that helped produce large quantities of ice, so it was never guaranteed that the American demand would be met."
