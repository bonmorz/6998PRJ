        "First, we need to establish the number of unemployed people due to 1933 Great Depression. The number of unemployed people due to 1933 Great Depression was around 20000 people in total. The number of unemployed people due to 1933 Great Depression was 20000 people in total. Next, we need to determine the seating capacity in Tiger Stadium. Tiger Stadium has seating capacity of 98,000 seats, with 22,000 seats, total seating capacity of 31,000 and a capacity of 31,000. In the past, Tiger Stadium has had a seating capacity of 46,000 seats. Now, we have to think about the space available in Tiger Stadium. At 12,000 seats, it will accommodate 162,000 unemployed people. This means that when the player has fewer than 1,000 unemployed people occupied seats, it is not enough to accommodate them. It would also be a problem if they were not occupied during the game due to the Depression. Therefore, it is important to know the seating capacity available for all unemployed players due to the 1933 Great Depression. The answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand the 1933 Great Depression. Historically, the depression did not have any impact on the economy, making it hard to imagine anyone who was unemployed or needed to take a job. The Depression had been triggered by massive and unexpected economic development, making it easier to calculate the distance between the two points. This means that unemployed people only had a distance of about a mile. Second, we need to figure out what Tiger Stadium is. Tiger Stadium was located in a small location in the city of Lake Placid, New Mexico. It had 22,000 seats, but there were only 2,000 seats, which was enough to fill 45,000 seats. The stadium had 2,27,000 seats. Thirdly, we need to evaluate the time of the Depression. In 1933, the depression was about 20 years old, but it also included many significant changes in the economy. During the depression, workers spent nearly 125,000 years in the workforce. When the war ended, the war ended, and the economy continued to shrink. In addition to the 1933 Great Depression, the stadium also had a budget deficit of about $360 billion, which is now $570 billion, which was roughly the size of the unemployed in that time. There were 12,000 unemployed people in the stadium who volunteered and received help, while there were 12,000 unemployed people in Tiger Stadium who were also unemployed. The average person in the stadium is approximately 84 hours per year. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what the 1933 Great Depression was. The 1930 Great Depression was a depression in 1933. This depression affected the housing and working-wage industries that were able to accommodate all unemployed workers. Now, let's consider the requirements of Tiger Stadium, the current seating capacity and seating capacity of the stadium. Since the stadium had 22,000 seats, it would be able to accommodate both offices and dormitories. However, due to the size of the stadium, it would not be able to accommodate all the unemployed people, which means that there would not be any additional capacity. Additionally, the stadium's capacity would not accommodate all the unemployed people who were not able to provide adequate accommodation. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the incorrect answers are not accurate and we can't speculate about the intended capacity of the stadium. Given these factors, we can conclude that the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand the type of housing that is used in Tiger Stadium. During World War II, the first millennium of the 21st century is a time when unemployment was at its worst. During this time, millions of unemployed people were in desperate need to stay, such as those found in the military camps. Next, we need to consider the size and economic hardship that alumnity found in such a low-income neighborhood. As a result, fewer people living in rural areas were required to work harder to provide for themselves. On the other hand, the unemployment rate was lower, making the situation less stable and the demand for jobs was higher. Based on these calculations, we can conclude that all the unemployed people due to the 1933 Great Depression could be accommodated at a sever minimum. Since there were a number of individuals who lived in the locality of the city, it is generally assumed that there would be many households and households there. If there were four households, it is possible that there could be enough available work to fill those numbers. On the other hand, we can see that many families did not manage to offer a stable or workable work life. However, as we can see, in fact, the numbers of unemployed people in the area of Tiger Stadium could be extended, which is based on the amount of work that the unemployed people did. Furthermore, if the number of unemployed people in the area was greater than the average wage rate in the country, the population of the non-gritty locations could be expanded. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who the 1933 Great Depression was. The depression lasted for more than a quarter century, resulting in a huge influx of unemployed people \u2013 the average age in the United States has decreased from 6 to 12. The depression slowed the growth of many industries, including manufacturing, which made it difficult to feed their workers. This means that some of the population of the city in the 1930s were working people rather than many citizens. Now, let's focus on whether the vacancy and loss of employment in the economy may be related to the 1933 Great Depression. Since unemployment had re-curered for years, a number of people were moving away from the stadium. Since the 1939 Great Depression had a negative impact on the economy, it would be reasonable to determine if any unemployed people in the city would fit comfortably in the stadium. For example, when the unemployment rate in the city at its peak during the Great Depression was below 17%, it took a significant resurgence to the unemployed to reach a critical level. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, all the unemployed people due to the 1933 Great Depression would fit comfortably in the stadium. Answer: B"

        "Thomas Pinckney &quot;Skipper&quot; Heard . The first expansion of Tiger Stadium in 1931 from 12,000 to 22,000 seats was due to Heard. He learned that LSU president James M. Smith had $250,000 earmarked for dormitories. Heard sold Smith on the idea that the president could have his dormitories in the stadium simply by raising the stands on both sides and extending them to each goal line. Heard expanded Tiger Stadium for the second time in 1936 by enclosing the north end of the stadium to increase seating capacity to 46,000. In 1953, Tiger Stadium was expanded for the third time by 21,720 seats to 67,720 by enclosing the south end turning Tiger Stadium into a bowl configuration."
