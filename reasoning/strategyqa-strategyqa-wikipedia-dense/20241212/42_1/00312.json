        "First, we need to define what cream is. Cream is a type of fat, which is a part of the fat in dairy. In store bought milk, cream and milk are two different types of fat. Cream, on the other hand, is a fat-specific product that contains oil, lacked sugar, and thus did not have a noticeable portion at the top of a milk container. Next, we need to define the logical value of cream for store bought milk. According to common belief, we know that the label of the store bought milk suggests that this product is high in fat or sugar. After careful research, we need to determine if the milk is fat or sugar. If the milk has been directly sold for sale or manufactured by a producer, then the milk may not contain the same fatty and sugar content as the product that is labeled for sale. If so, the milk may not have an obvious distinction between fat and sugar, which is the difference between a fat-specific and milk-specific product. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) yes. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what cream is. cream is a solid substance containing cream or milk which is placed on a piece of paper or paper. Next, we need to understand the size of the milk container. The small cream globule in milk is around 2\u20134, the size of the cream. Now, let\u2019s consider what store bought milk contains cream at the top of it. Cream is a liquid substance which is used to separate products and cludle them into different components in a single liquid. The large cream globules in milk contain cream. Next, we need to know the size of the cream. In a store bought milk, the cream globule is located on the top of the milk container. Now, let\u2019s think about the size of the cream globules in milk. When they are in the correct proportions, it divides the globules of milk equally evenly. Milk is a particular product in the supply of milk and therefore may not be a higher cream. However, since there is no cream at the top of the milk container, it may not be an incredibly thick or dense layer. The difference between globules of milk and cream doesn\u2019t change the content of the cream. This means that the amount of cream used at the top of the milk will vary depending on the size and volume of the milk. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, store bought milk does not have cream at the top of it. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what cream is. Cream is a protein that comes from the upper portion of the globules that make up the top portion of milk. Therefore, store bought milk does not have cream at the top. It simply consists of fat in the milk rather than liquid. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First of all, you need to determine the weight of milk. It is highly important to consider the weight of milk as a measure of fat content in each piece of milk. Milk comes from cows, and milk contains fat, sugar, and oils that are not naturally found in milk. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, nor do store bought milk have cream at the top. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, store bought milk cannot contain cream. However, cream at the top is typically a liquid type of milk, like cream with a low, olfactory taste, which may or may not have cream a lagular. For example, some milk from cows and some restaurants typically have large amounts of cream, while some milk from dairy products such as milks are frozen. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Milk . Upon standing for 12 to 24 hours, fresh milk has a tendency to separate into a high-fat cream layer on top of a larger, low-fat milk layer. The cream often is sold as a separate product with its own uses. Today the separation of the cream from the milk usually is accomplished rapidly in centrifugal cream separators. The fat globules rise to the top of a container of milk because fat is less dense than water. The smaller the globules, the more other molecular-level forces prevent this from happening. In fact, the cream rises in cow's milk much more quickly than a simple model would predict: rather than isolated globules, the fat in the milk tends to form into clusters containing about a million globules, held together by a number of minor whey proteins. These clusters rise faster than individual globules can. The fat globules in milk from goats, sheep, and water buffalo do not form clusters as readily and are smaller to begin with, resulting in a slower separation of cream from these milks."
