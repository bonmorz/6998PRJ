        "First, we need to establish what the Eurovision Song Contest is and it is based on the name of actress Dafne Keen. Now, we need to determine who Dafne Keen is. Dafne Keen is an American actress, singer, and actress that has been in the industry for more than 30 years. Therefore, the Eurovision Song Contest is not actually a contest between the two of them. Therefore, it is unlikely for Dafne Keen to win the Eurovision Song Contest, and if she can, she would not have a chance to win the contest. The Eurovision Song Contest is a musical contest between two artists, DJ, and actors, who primarily performed under pop and rock music. Therefore, Dafne Keen may not be the best actress for her role, but she can be a part of the group, which means that she would not win any of the contests given her gender or experience. Furthermore, the European Union and the Eurovision Song Contest did not have any material or competition that requires an agreement with a country.

        "Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 . Prior to the 2015 Contest, Ireland had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest forty-eight times since its first entry in 1965. Ireland has won the contest a record seven times in total. The country's first win came in 1970, with then-18-year-old Dana winning with \"All Kinds of Everything\". Ireland holds the record for being the only country to win the contest three times in a row (in 1992, 1993 and 1994), as well as having the only three-time winner (Johnny Logan, who won in 1980 as a singer, 1987 as a singer-songwriter, and again in 1992 as a songwriter). For the past four years, Ireland's national final format, Eurosong, had used a mentor system which involved five music professionals being appointed to seek out an artist and song for a televised competition in order to select the Irish entry. In 2011 and 2012, Jedward represented the nation for two consecutive years, managing to qualify to the final both times and achieve Ireland's highest position in the contest since 2000, placing eighth in 2011 with the song \"Lipstick\". However, in 2013, despite managing to qualify to the final, Ryan Dolan and his song \"Only Love Survives\" placed last in the final, while in 2014 Ireland missed the final entirely with Can-Linn featuring Kasey Smith and the song \"Heartbeat\"."
