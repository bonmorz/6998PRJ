        "First, we need to understand who John Key was. John Key was the United States President from 1959-70, who served in office from 1962-1986, including President Nixon and then Vice President John F. Kennedy. Next, we need to establish what executive orders are in the United States. Executive orders, which refers to the executive orders of Presidents, typically are issued when a government official orders them to take action to achieve a particular policy, change, or mandate. Other orders that were in the United States included a President's Order, which was to issue executive orders to a private sector or a private individual. Next, we need to understand what a executive order is. An executive order is an executive order in the United States of America that addresses the requirements of a specific government policy, such as eligibility, the legal basis for a particular position or category in order, and a specific category in response to a specific policy or ensuing position or circumstances. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, John Key's executive order could not apply in the USA or apply in any other country. Answer: B",
        "Based on John Key's presidency, he was known as President John F. Kennedy, president of the United States. His role in the government fueled the creation of the term \"affirmative action\" and \"conductive action,\" which both served to those who seek affirmative action. These executive offices include the Office of Management and Budget's Bureau of Chief Administrators, or BOMB's Bureau of Internal Affairs, or BOAD, by imposing a power order on key staff such as a \"stability review\", which occurs every year. Key is a federal employee who is a private citizen, and his executive roles include acting as chief executive and executive officer, enforcing a federal contract with a major government body. In addition, Key embodies a powerful influence in politics, especially in the state of Washington and his decision to adopt a policy that allowed the military in World War II to establish a \"wide-based policy of civil activity\" and create jobs that reflects his diverse political, religious, and ethnic background. Furthermore, Key's presidency was enamored of the US constitution and the Supreme Constitution as a whole, which was intended to provide the necessary governmental protection and regulatory framework. Hypothesizes that Key's leadership could have been highly influential. Given the complexity of what we know about essential facts about key, we are assuming that Key himself is not the author of the Executive Order. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to define what an executive order is. Executive orders are executive orders requiring that governments must provide for equal treatment and accountability for workers, employees, and employers. They are generally known to include a ban on collective bargaining and other benefits. Therefore, if we consider John Key, who was the first president and CEO of the United States, we can see that he was an exec of the United States as well as Vice President of the United States. In other words, he was also a President and CEO of the United States. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) yes, he could issue an executive order in the USA. Answer: B",
        "When deciding on the question, we should take the following factors: Number of elected representatives, as well as the number of candidates, which includes the President of the United States, and the office of president. Given that we do have one key figure, he could not issue an executive order in the US, we need to determine how he could properly be able to do this. Number of any executive orders issued by president John Key, as noted in the paragraph are the only ones he has taken. Therefore, it is likely that he would be able to issue an executive order in the USA by either asking for the President to grant a vote of confidence or favor. Also, while John Key was a president, he was also a senator, who had to take a final vote to endorse a motion for re-election. Having a representative or two present, it would be a reasonable decision to appoint him to a position of executive authority. If it did not apply to him, we could easily have made a wrong decision. Given that John Key was a president of the United States before it was appropriate for a President to do this, there is no way to revoke any executive order issued by him, nor the ability to issue a direct executive order. Answer: A",
        "The question is asking about how John Key would submit his executive orders to the United States. He will answer his executive orders by placing his hand in a dispensed hand and requiring his consent to provide the public with his consent. Next, we need to consider if the government's mandated executive order for the government and of the government is legitimate and applicable. An executive order is an order issued to establish a legal authority to receive the services of a government government or corporations. Therefore, it can be concluded that the US government would not properly issue an executive order against John Key and could not be issued under his executive orders as a general mandate. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Affirmative action in the United States . In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \"affirmative action\" in its contemporary sense in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress."
