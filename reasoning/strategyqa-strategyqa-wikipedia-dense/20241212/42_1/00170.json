        "First, we need to define what happens when we eat hair. Hair eats primarily the end of the body, while eating the hair of the human side of the body. Next, it is important to define what is done to stop the eating. In this case, we were asked to know the correct answer to the question. The answer is (A) yes. If someone is having trouble eating their hair, it is important to understand their eating habits. They typically want to avoid or avoid the hair, and avoid or eliminate hair altogether. However, the fact that we do so does not make it safe to eat hair. This may be the case where we should not eat the hair, but rather feed the other person a healthy meal. Since there are a number of hair types to consider when it comes to eating, it is important to focus on the options you should consider. Depending on where we are from and your personal habits, you may consider eating hair specifically based on the type of hair that we have in the store or the location where we are from. Additionally, we do not want to limit ourselves, however, to suggest or suggest that we eat hair or just let it interfere with our eating habits. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, it's safe to eat hair. Hair can contain protein that can be used for the development of proteins. We should consider whether the hair is sufficient to carry a bacteria-enriched diet, and even whether it's safe to eat it. This question requires a number of steps, including some types of diet. This type of diet can largely be done by eating hair (such as meat, fish, and vegetables), including a small amount of sugary, watery hair, which can contain sugar and prothropsin. Food can also have harmful systomy bacteria such as uric acid, which may cause intestinal irritation or infection if handled in the correct way. The food can be contaminated or contain chemicals that can be harmful for humans. It is important to note that it's highly unlikely that hair could actually be exposed to this gastrointestinal allergen. However, this is highly unlikely. Therefore, it's best to consult medical professionals and go to the store for any additional information or remedies. This may be an option or there's something wrong with the questions. However, it's important to keep in mind what's not right, and that's not safe. Answer: A",

        "Firstly, hair is known as a genus with a variety of eating disorder. In addition to that, consuming more hair can leave one with longer bouts of diarrhea, abdominal pain, diarrheic acid, and nausea, which are common symptoms of some types of mental illness. Finally, people may experience gastrointestinal distress, nausea, diarrhea, and diarrhea. Therefore, it is safe to eat hair.

        "Trichophagia . Trichophagia is characterized by the person eating hair, usually their own; primarily after pulling it out. Most often, hair is pulled out and then the ends of the root bulb are eaten, or occasionally the hair shaft itself. The hair eventually collects in the gastrointestinal tract (on occasion, and depending upon severity of symptoms) causing indigestion and stomach pain. Ritual is a strong factor, and may involve touching the root bulb to the lips, tasting the hair, and occasionally chewing it. Sometimes those with the disorder may even eat the hair of others. In the psychiatric field it is considered a compulsive psychological disorder."
