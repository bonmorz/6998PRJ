        "First, we need to consider the meaning of the Messiah (Handel) in the Bible. Messiah (Handel) is a Christian hymn, religious leader, orphan who is known for delivering the sacrificial offering of the Messiah (King James). Next, we need to consider Bruce Gandy. Bruce Gandy is known as a composer and musical actor who has worked in music and theatre. While Bruce Gandy has been in many artistic endeavors, he not only has been known for his vocal talents, but he also teaches us about the life and faith of Jesus Christ. Therefore, we can safely say that Bruce Gandy would have given Him the blessings of Jesus Christ to carry a cross to the city, as it would have made him a master musician. Now, we can consider the Messiah (Handel). Messiah (Handel) is a Christian hymn sung by the Bible's Messiah, Christ, and was written in 1482 AD by John Smith. This hymn is a Christian version of the gospel text from the Old Testament, written by Thomas Fessenfield, and is written in a different manner than the Messiah. Therefore, while Bruce Gandy would have been a perfect fit for Messiah (Handel), his choice was based on Jesus' character as the Messiah. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to know what Messiah (Handel) is. Messiah (Handel) is a biblical line of the biblical Messiah and includes the Jesus Christ as the Messiah. Next, we need to consider Bruce Gandy's song, which is considered his most important song, and it is an especially strong theme music. Bruce Gandy is a composer and musician, whose works include works such as the song \"the Saviour\". He also wrote hymns and other sacred tunes. However, he does not have a significant solo or solo voice, thus it is unlikely that he would play the Messiah as a solo-singer. Hence, the correct answer to the question is \"yes\". Since there is no clear time limit to the Messiah and Messiah can be found in a music studio, it does not suggest there is an odd choice for him as a soloist or a guest. Since we know from research and analysis that Bruce Gandy would not be a popular choice for Messiah, it is unlikely that he would have been chosen for someone who is famous for her role. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Bruce Gandy would be an odd choice for Messiah. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who God is. God is a spiritual being who, depending on various religions, uses god to worship His creation. Messiah, on the other hand, is a human being who, along with Jesus, is the Messiah. Next, we need to consider the significance of Bruce Gandy. Bruce Gandy is a German painter who died at the age of 27. Since Bruce Gandy lived in Virginia Harbor, VA, we can assume that he died at age 30 or 30, though that doesn't matter. So, if we are to compare Bruce Gandy to Messiah (which is not a religious designation), then we see that he is a religious person and therefore we can assume that Gandy is the correct choice. Furthermore, the similarities between Messiah and Gandy are that the two had similar religious roles and similarities, so the results are that a person who is not Jewish and not the Messiah could be able to fit the role. The correct answer is (B) no, because Bruce Gandy was not born during his lifetime, but rather associated with his childhood and the Messiah's personality. Therefore, we do not consider him an odd choice for Messiah. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who Messiah (Handel) is. Messiah (Handel), is a samaritan in Jewish theology. It's believed that the Messiah was a Messiah and was named after Jesus. Next, we need to consider whether Bruce Gandy would be a great choice to perform as Messiah (Handel). This makes me think that Bruce Gandy would have a great sense of control - he is extremely quick in performing. He's a great songwriter and we could really go for that, but Bruce Gandy would be a good choice as he is often known for his direction and character development. Finally, we need to consider the choice of Messiah and Messiah. Messiah is the first Messiah and Messiah is God's Messiah. Jesus Christ is the Messiah who was born into this world. Rather than using these roles as a choice, they would not have been the right choice. If we know that Bruce Gandy is a great actor, they would have been good choices, but there is no clear indication that Bruce Gandy would be an excellent choice, given this information. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, no, because it's not based on common sense. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what Messiah is. Messiah is a mythical religious figure who has been called a god of peace. His mystical power is worshipped by the followers of Jesus Christ, who is known for his compassion and healing skills. The word \"humasticos\" in Hebrew literature is derived from the verb \"humatri-\" in German. Finally, we can rephrase some of Bruce Gandy's writings to clarify that he is not a poet or music director. However, they may have the same title associated with Gandy's work. Therefore, based on these two instances, we can safely assume that Bruce Gandy would be the choice of Messiah (Handel) or any other person on the earth. This is due to the many references to the biblical story Jesus Christ is the Messiah (Handel). It seems unlikely that Bruce Gandy would have been the choice of Messiah, even though he is known for his love of music and his devotion to his beloved Jesus Christ. While some might have believed him to be a pacification movement and healing warrior, it doesn't mean that his music and style contradicts his own beliefs. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, not Bruce Gandy would have been an odd choice for Messiah (Handel) as a Christian or Christian musician. However, it does provide a fair chance for answering these questions. Answer: B"

        "Messiah (Handel) . In Christian theology, the Messiah is the saviour of the Jewish people and humankind. The Messiah who is called Christ, is identified with the person of Jesus, known by his followers as the Christ or \"Jesus Christ\". Handel's \"Messiah\" has been described by the early-music scholar Richard Luckett as \"a commentary on [Jesus Christ's] Nativity, Passion, Resurrection and Ascension\", beginning with God's promises as spoken by the prophets and ending with Christ's glorification in heaven. In contrast with most of Handel's oratorios, the singers in \"Messiah\" do not assume dramatic roles; there is no single, dominant narrative voice; and very little use is made of quoted speech. In his libretto, Jennens's intention was not to dramatise the life and teachings of Jesus, but to acclaim the \"Mystery of Godliness\", using a compilation of extracts from the Authorized (King James) Version of the Bible, and from the Psalms included in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer."
