        "Firstly, Michael Crichton was a computer professor who resigned in 1984 due to an accident. He later went on to complete a research project for MIT under guidance of John F. Kennedy. Secondly, it is important to note that Criston's time at Harvard was during a time when he was developing computer and computer programs that required a degree in mathematics. Rather than resigning, Crichton went to Harvard for a degree in finance and applied law, while at the university. This gives a snapshot of what it meant for him to be in the field of mathematics. If he hadn't taken the required math and computer program and began to use it, he probably would not have been offered admissions. However, the question raises the question as a potential risk of flunking out of Harvard as an undergraduate. According to CORRECTS, this may be the case. While criticizing Crichton for his academic achievements at Harvard is a great step, the question of a potential danger in a possible attempt at overcoming a career path that led him to focus on higher-ranking positions and not in the political arena. Therefore, it is important to note that Crichton may have taken risks in his time at Harvard in his career as well. Instead of giving himself a chance to snag the degree he did, he would have taken a chance and tried his way out. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to identify the information about chanting that Michael Crichton used to grow up at Harvard. Rather than using his sex and other traits to snore or criticize, Crichton tried to use his academics to create a reputation as uncritical and ridiculting. Next, we need to identify what type of virtuous behavior he used to avoid during his time at Harvard. He was frequently criticized for his views of science, politics, and engineering. He spent some time in prison before graduating and was rabid to commit armed robbery. Afterwards, he wrote the book \"Afraid of Computers\" that he believed he will never use his computer in any way or in any way for his life. Now, consider using Michael Crichton's words, as in \"I'll be an engineer for years,\" to answer the question. For Michael Crichton, this means that he's \"vulnerable\" and unable to understand complex science and technology. Therefore, he's not a true genius at all. The final answer to this question is (A) yes, Michael Crichton has flunked out of Harvard as an undergraduate. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to consider Michael Crichton's history as an undergraduate. He was a well-known professor at Harvard, graduating in 1998. Next, we need to know the importance of keeping a balanced view of society. Several undergraduates have worked at Harvard for decades, having worked hard to make intelligent life choices and teaching college. Now we need to consider the possible circumstances relating to his future in the field. While Michael Crichton's career centered in politics, he developed ideas about how and who he grew up as a college education consultant and hired his own team to teach college courses. In addition, his career in academia and the degree he earned from it largely came with a wide-range range of issues affecting modern society. While many of his focuses included personal finances, his degree in education was highly ranked. According to the National Association of Teacher Education and Technical Education, Michael Crichton was the first person to formally educate himself about computer science in an overwhelmingly maleized college in the United States. However, the resulting negative social consequences of a college education he failed to implement in his career included a lack of leadership, a loss of confidence in his work, and the lack of a clear understanding of society's values. Based on these factors, we can conclude that Michael Crichton may have been flunked out of Harvard as an undergraduate. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, Michael Crichton did ever falter out of Harvard as an undergraduate. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to establish the fact that Michael Crichton was a professor at Harvard University, which means he is a well-respected historian who has been well-pracised as a scholar. Next, we need to consider the question. In academic circles, it is highly untrue that Michael Crichton was a researcher and lecturer at Harvard. With that in mind, we can deduce that Michael Crichton was in danger of flunking out of Harvard, as the academic system requires that the student who has graduated from Harvard (meaning an undergraduate) at the University, did not flunk out of Harvard. As such, the answer to the question is (B) no, it is unclear and it does not appear in this context. However, if the question is asking about what Michael Crichton was flunking out of Harvard as an undergraduate, it does not mean any of the above. Therefore, it does not really mean that Michael Crichton ever did fraternize with Harvard, or any other government officials in the field. As such, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to establish how much education has been given to Michael Crichton and his undergraduate college education. It is highly likely that he did not find a major or a program at Harvard that he could flunk out, which is not considered an eval. Next, we need to determine how much time is given to the question. We know that he spent his college education at Harvard, and the term \"flunking\" was something that was difficult to quantify. In this case, the question does not refer to his college years, but the overall time spent working on the program, such as completing a project or writing a piece of fiction. Thus, it can't be expected that the question is related to a specific course of study or a particular topic or subject. It's necessary to understand what specific circumstances are presented in the question to help answer this question. First, we need to know how long is a college undergraduate at Harvard. The answer is around 25 years. In this case, the question asks whether Michael Crichton was flunked out of Harvard. Ultimately, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Michael Crichton . In 1983, Crichton wrote \"Electronic Life\", a book that introduces BASIC programming to its readers. The book, written like a glossary, with entries such as \"Afraid of Computers (everybody is)\", \"Buying a Computer\", and \"Computer Crime\", was intended to introduce the idea of personal computers to a reader who might be faced with the hardship of using them at work or at home for the first time. It defined basic computer jargon and assured readers that they could master the machine when it inevitably arrived. In his words, being able to program a computer is liberation; \"In my experience, you assert control over a computer\u2014show it who's the boss\u2014by making it do something unique. That means programming it...If you devote a couple of hours to programming a new machine, you'll feel better about it ever afterwards\". In the book, Crichton predicts a number of events in the history of computer development, that computer networks would increase in importance as a matter of convenience, including the sharing of information and pictures that we see online today which the telephone never could. He also makes predictions for computer games, dismissing them as \"the hula hoops of the '80s\", and saying \"already there are indications that the mania for twitch games may be fading.\" In a section of the book called \"Microprocessors, or how I flunked biostatistics at Harvard\", Crichton again seeks his revenge on the medical school teacher who had given him abnormally low grades in college. Within the book, Crichton included many self-written demonstrative Applesoft (for Apple II) and BASICA (for IBM PC compatibles) programs."
