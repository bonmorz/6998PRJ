        "The computer is portable enough to store up to 80 gigabytes of video, a small amount of storage, and a single video-capacity device would make up about 150-200 gigabytes. Thus, if you need to store 10 hours of Netflix shows, it would take around 7 hours, while on the USB, it's possible to have enough free space for about 4GB. Hence, the correct answer is (B) no. Given this question, it would make sense to put 5 x 8GB USB device on, along with four x 10 - gigabytes USB to compress your file library. The answer might be (B) no, but the correct answer may not match your answer. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what the amount of storage in a USB-device is. Most USB-related device manufacturers use the maximum amount of space they require, including 3.5 GB and 2.4 GB. Next, we need to consider the number of apps and websites that can be downloaded to increase data transfer speed. It is possible to use the USB-related apps such as Amazon's Snap, Firefox, or Netflix's Disc Store for free or your own creative ideas such as books, music, and videos. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, it is not sufficient to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what an USB flash drive is. A USB flash drive (also called a computer memory stick) is a small, flashy USB storage device that can hold up to about 100 gigabytes (45GB) of video and video content on its own capacity. Next, we need to define the time in which an hour of Netflix episodes would take place. To do this, we need to consider that the time in the day is approximately 150 minutes, based on data usage over the 10 hours that it would take, for example, on a single night, and over several hours of streaming. For a daily streaming event, we need to consider how long the hours were taken from each segment and how many hours it took the average time to transfer the entire volume to the screen. This way, we can determine the time that it took us to transfer the bandwidth and how many hours it took for each hour. This data can be much faster in the short time we could see each hour; 4400 to 10,000, for example, would take around 10,000 hours to stream and 4400 to the hour's maximum time of 4400 - 10,000. Furthermore, these figures have potential ramifications. In general, ramifications of a video screen are only one minute away from 100 megabytes and are far beyond the capacity of a flash drive (up to 500GB). In terms of time, it takes an average of 10 hours to spend on video and 10 hours of streaming time, which includes more or less bandwidth than anything of value. Since the total duration for a day and the number of hours of videos we will be watching is higher than the amount needed for Netflix shows, it would be less than the maximum cost of the hours spent streaming the files in a single day. In addition, the e-reader time, as reported by Amazon, is the amount of time it takes to load various files, as we expected there would be enough time to transfer this data out of a battery-powered device. In summary, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "1. Since the Kindle Fire is a portable device, it can be used for books, movies, and games at any time of day and most of the time it needs to be running for a few hours to fill up the disk space. 2. Additionally, a device with an external USB cable would only fit into the USB cord and the connection to a network is capable of an 8 GB external hard drive on its front that can be used as part of a continuous stream of content and video, depending on its desired storage capacity. 3. Therefore, the answer to the question is not based on what 500GB USB-C device is used to store for Netflix shows compared to other similar USB-shelf portable devices, as Samsung products are portable and use USB-C ports less than the size of their internals and the amount of storage they need. This means that the amount of free space is not that big enough for Netflix shows. 4. Therefore, it's worth noting that a 200 GB external USB-C-A external USB-C-A external USB-C-A device is not capable to support a full 10 hours of Netflix shows a day. Answer: B",
        "First, there is only 1GB of storage available on a 500-gigahertz USB cable. It is 1GB storage equal to about 80g. Next, we need to determine how much capacity the USB cable can store. Since 4400GB is the minimum amount of memory available on a USB device, it would likely take 3 hours to complete 3 hours of Netflix shows. Since 5 lbs. of capacity can be used to have sufficient enough space to play music, movies, and photos, it would be sufficient to fill up 10 hours of Netflix shows. However, assuming that the USB cable can fit into only 10 g, there are no issues or rip-offs in this field, thus giving us a higher answer. Answer: B"

        "Kindle Fire . The Kindle Fire hardware was originally manufactured by Quanta Computer (an Original Design Manufacturer), which had also helped design the BlackBerry PlayBook, using it as a hardware template for the Kindle Fire. First-generation Kindle Fire devices employed a 1-GHz Texas Instruments OMAP 4430 dual-core processor. The device has a 2-point multi-touch color LCD screen with a diagonal length of and a 600\u00d71024-pixel resolution (160 dpi density). Connectivity is through 802.11n Wi-Fi and USB 2.0 (Micro-B connector). The device includes 8\u00a0GB of internal storage\u2014said to be enough for 80 applications, plus either 10 movies or 800 songs or 6,000 books. According to Amazon the first-generation Kindle Fire's 4400\u00a0mAh battery sustains up to 8 hours of consecutive reading and up to 7.5 hours of video playback with wireless off; later generations all offered around 7\u20138 hours"
