        "First, we need to determine who Johnny Carson's children are. Johnny Carson's children are 9 years old and 12 years old, while his younger siblings are 9 years old and ten years old. Next, we need to determine the size of a water polo team. A water polo team is a group of six players who compete at least once every week. Initially, the water polo team consisted of four players from all over the world and only four players. Next, we need to determine the total number of games played by all the participants in the water polo team to be able to fill out the team. Since both Johnny and his children have a larger aging body, they would not have enough water polo in their repertoire to meet the challenges of a water polo team. Therefore, based on this information, the correct answer would be (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who Johnny Carson is. Johnny Carson is famous for being a hard-working, ambitious musician. To answer the question, we should look into his family. Johnny Carson is an American actor, and his children are all around the ages. Therefore, to answer the question, it is highly unlikely that Johnny Carson's children would be capable of filling out a water polo team. Therefore, it is highly unlikely for Johnny Carson's children to fill out a water polo team. The answer is (A) yes, he could have their children fill in a water polo team. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to determine who Johnny Carson is and who is Johnny Carson. Johnny Carson has three children. Next, we need to determine the age of Johnny Carson's children. Since the children have a age range of about 50 and 30, it is possible that Johnny Carson would have fewer children. Next, we need to determine when Johnny Carson's children would need to be on a water polo team. The first year of a child's life is typically played 6 days apart. Now, it would have to be considered a school or other age level of an adult in order to make sure Johnny Carson and his children could compete in water polo competitions. The earliest possible time before the youngest teen was entering high school was in 1990. So, when Johnny Carson's five-year-old son was born, there were a lot of water polo games to worry about during a training camp and during the day. Therefore, it is impossible for Johnny Carson's children to fill out the water polo team. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Johnny Carson's children would not fill a water polo team. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine if Johnny Carson's children can fill out a water polo team. The answer is (B) no. Johnny Carson has three children, one ten-year-old, and one thirteen-year-old. Next, we need to determine the age of Johnny Carson's children. Johnny Carson's children were only 15 years old when he became president in 1985. They graduated from Glendale High School of Education, a private school. Now, we need to determine if Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team. It is extremely unlikely that anyone would be able to fill out a water polo team, as a lot of children play water polo or other sports such as baseball or ice hockey. The only way that these two choices are in the equation is the age of their children and the physical capacity of each of them. The question asks if Johnny Carson could fill out a water polo team. It would take his kids into the game of polo. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine what a water polo team is. A water polo team is a type of team that consists of a team consisting of five (4) opponents that contested each other during a competition, usually using either a nipper or an opposing goalkeeper. To do this, we need to perform physical testing to identify the level of water polo skills or water polo experience that Johnny Carson's children would require. It can take a lifetime for a team to fill out, however, and the team would have to rely on a ten-year-old athlete's knowledge of water polo rules and water polo games. For example, while Johnny Carson's high school coach played water polo professionally as a youth, he did not have to play water polo at his youth. The only water polo teams that Johnny Carson was a member of were water polo players. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Johnny Carson's children would not fill out a water polo team. Answer: B"
