        "First, we need to see Marlboro, the renowned marquee, explains what the Marlboro hat is meant for. Next, we need to know whether it actually has colors on it. Marlboro is made of 100% cotton, and its packaging states that it has three colors. Now, what is a comma. Marlboro is used to deliver flags, if it exists and produces a blue-blue color on top, it should likely come in red and orange color. Its colors are either black or white, depending on what we know. But, there is no evidence that the colors in the Marlboro hat can match the colors on the French flag.

It is a brand trademark of Marlboro hat and may be used for flags from France. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is (B) no. Answer: B",

        "Flag of the United States . As with the design, the official colors are only officially required for flags produced for the U.S. federal government, and other colors are often used for mass-market flags, printed reproductions, and other products intended to evoke flag colors.
