        "First, we need to understand what it means to be close to Allah. It means that Allah is not directly linked to a person in some way, but rather to Allah or anyone of particular origin. Finally, we need to consider the question's purpose. Marco Rubio is a politician who is best known for his support for the National Socialists. He has made his position in politics clear and focused since the beginning of the republic, while still being a conservative conservative. Next, we need to consider whether Allah has a close relationship with a person like Me, or not. The question is asking if he or her has a close relationship with Allah or not. This is a simple question in which we can answer whether we know that Allah is not directly linked to his or her views. However, we cannot say that we have a close relationship with Allah. Based on these two, we can conclude that if, like Marco Rubio is, someone has a close relationship with Allah, he or she is not as close to Him or it is not possible. Consequently, the correct answer to the question would be to confirm that Marco Rubio has a close relationship with Allah. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to establish who Marco Rubio is. He is a president of the Republic of Mexico, who is also a political activist, and he is well known in Mexico for his work in human rights advocacy. Next, we need to look into the history of his political views. We see Marco Rubio was a representative of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and he lived during the 1960s and was the president of the United States from 1969-1962, when he was president. This was the early 90's, when he was a Senator and his closest and closest friend were John McCain, who was the President's opponent in the presidential election. Therefore, it is possible that Marco Rubio has a close relationship with Allah because he was a Republican and not a politician. Additionally, he was the governor of Texas in 1954, where he was President from 1967 to 1973. So, the question is somewhat asking if he had close or close relationship with Allah. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand who Marco Rubio is. Marco Rubio is an ex-convict from the late 1980s, whose career saw him take his family and friends to live in the suburbs of Kansas City, Kansas. Next, we need to understand what Allah means to us. Allah is a group of human emotions and is often characterized by the word 'love'. Now, we need to consider some of the things that we know about Allah and its people. Compared to the world around us, it's important to note that there have been many instances in which people have expressed their discontent and disdain for Allah. It's important to note that in his stead, he often spoke of his belief and faith in Allah, which is linked to his lifestyle in a number of ways. For example, we know that since Marco Rubio is Jewish, he has often used this term on religious topics, like religion. So, while Marco Rubio has been Jewish since he was a child, they can still have the same faith in Allah, which they do not believe in. So, we can assume that the question is asking about his relationship with Allah is not related to his life experiences. In fact, we can imagine that as a Jewish person, he had a close relationship with Allah that reflects religious values and beliefs. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine who Muhammad and Allah is. Muhammad is a Qureshi Muslim in Turkey. Next, we need to understand the concept of friendship. Friendship is a relationship between individuals, not God. Friendship is also a metaphor for faith and life, not hate or doubt. Therefore, it's important to identify God and believe in Allah. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First of all, it is important to understand what we are asking about. Marco Rubio is an American politician who is married to his late wife, Katarina. They have two children, John and Marco. They currently serve a Deputy Attorney General of the Supreme Court, and they served as the Assistant to President of the Supreme Court from 2005-2009. Now, it is important to consider if the conversation is centered on the possibility that the answer is \"no,\" since it is unclear whether or not he has a close relationship with Allah. It is possible that he has a relationship with Allah in some form. Since both have different backgrounds and political beliefs, it can be assumed that they are familiar with each other's religion and beliefs. For example, the relationship between John and Marco could perhaps be an example of the difference between the two and be interpreted differently. Since Marco is a Latino politician, it might be possible that he has a close connection with Allah. As opposed to a strong religious belief in relation, Marco does not have deep or strong religious relationships. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is (B) no, Marco Rubio does not have a close relationship with Allah. Answer: B"

        "Du'a Arafah . During the supplication, Shia Imam Husayn ibn Ali praises Allah. He bears witness that there is no God but Allah, and describes the return of all people to Allah after death. The steps of human creation until his death and the wonders of nature are described by explaining important issues in various branches of science. He suggests the weakness of human beings and the need for them to offer thanks to Allah who does not need their thanks. Some parts end with \"peace be upon the prophet\". In one part of the prayer, Husayn ibn Ali asks Allah to show him how to come closer to him and to aid in establishing a good relationship with Allah. He describes his neediness and asks Allah to help him to be patient in the face of adversity in the world and the hereafter. The Shia Imam believes that the blessings of Allah are infinite."
