        "First, it is important to consider the amount and size of the vehicles involved in an event, so it is highly unlikely that someone could have walked through the door of a Toyota Prius. Next, it is necessary to know that Wrestlemania X is a live event, so it is impossible to be safely transported with someone in a Toyota Prius. However, it is possible that somebody could have entered the stadium in the Toyota Prius and not have walked through the door to the tournament. As a matter of fact, in terms of seating, it is impossible to be transported into the stadium in the Toyota Prius. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that someone could have walked from the stadium to Wrestlemania X in a Toyota Prius. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, someone can have been safely transported in a Toyota Prius. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what a Toyota Prius is. A Toyota Prius is a brand of car designed by Toyota and manufactured by Infinity Toyota in the US, which means they are designed for work during the 1980s. The car has a fuel consumption of around 300 mpg, which means the drive distance is 2,000 km per hour. Next, we need to understand why we cannot have someone make a claim to the Toyota Prius. In reality, it is a small, but powerful car designed to make it through 20,000 km in a year. At Wrestlemania X, for instance, someone can claim to be able to arrive at Wrestlemania X in a Toyota Prius. However, it can be highly complicated. For example, it is difficult for someone to be made a claim and claim that a Toyota Prius is not in use. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine if Wrestlemania X is in a United States venue, or if someone has already arrived somewhere in the US. Secondly, what is a Toyota Prius? This vehicle is a small SUV, but it is typically capable of running a maximum of 3 miles in an hour. They are not used for commercial purposes and may not be used for military missions, such as a nightmaring expedition. This means that anyone visiting Wrestlemania X, and not even the person on the security checklist, would have to wait on the side of the police. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, someone could have arrived at Wrestlemania X in a Toyota Prius. Answer: B",
        "First, it is important to remember that Wrestlemania X is a small, one-person arena in Los Angeles that is open to all visitors. This means that it's possible to have someone arrive at Wrestlemania X in a Toyota Prius. Toyota Prius's maximum speed is 240 km/h, while the average speed is 20,000 km/d. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, someone could have arrived at Wrestlemania X in a Toyota Prius. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand how long it takes a person to reach to Wrestlemania X. This means that it takes several days to reach the venue. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, someone could have arrived at Wrestlemania X in a Toyota Prius. Answer: B"

        "Toyota Prius . In the UK, the Advertising Standards Authority, an independent body charged with policing the rules of the advertising industry, ruled that a television advert for the Toyota Prius should not be broadcast again in the same form, having breached rules concerning misleading advertising. The advertisement stated that the Prius \"emits up to one tonne less per year\", while on-screen text included \"1 tonne of less than an equivalent family vehicle with a diesel engine. Average calculated on 20,000 km a year.\" Points of contention were the vehicles chosen for comparison, whether \"up to' one tonne less\" adequately communicated that reductions could be lower, and whether the distance used was appropriate: 20,000\u00a0km per year is around a US car's average annual driving distance, while a UK car's is 13,440\u00a0km."
