        "First, we need to understand what it means to be a secretary. We need to understand what it means to be a secretary, and we need to consider a few possible scenarios. A secretary is someone who carries around the same physical and emotional burden of the workplace. It may refer to a secretary who is in many different ways associated with a secretary job. A secretary may also be someone who is responsible for the direction of an employee or vice versa. The important thing is to recognize that these two facts are true; therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, it is not necessarily an ideal choice for a secretary job. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what Tange Sazen is. It's a Chinese ruler from the Tang dynasty. This means that it was not likely to attract more women from his dynasty in order to get a secretary job. Next, we need to consider what roles and responsibilities it would likely require. Mostly, it's seen as someone who could hold different responsibilities or be responsible for a certain group of people. Generally speaking, the secretary is a specialized position that involves coordinating and managing a large team of people. Alternatively, the executive role could be a role-based position, a position that involves coordinating and managing a team of people, leading or helping someone in the midst of a crisis. Therefore, it doesn't offer any choice in terms of the specific job outlook, as it only focuses on one thing. Hence, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, it is important to understand how to create a strong foundation for a woman. A woman's career can only be built around the words \"citifact,\" not the \"need\" of a \"successful career,\" or the ideal woman for that specific person. Next, it is important to consider what \"tange Sachez\" means. Tange Sazen is a famous Chinese poet known for her intense devotion to poetry. She wrote a short poem and a poem, \"Ve\" (\"Cade and Sense\") in 1552. Therefore, if a woman is a poet and a good businessperson, then it is likely she would be able to get the proper support in a time of stress or uncertain work. If something were to go on and on, it's probably the best choice. Moreover, if a woman is working as a secretary, she will have a higher probability to gain a positive outcome, as in the case of Tange Sazen. While many companies employ people with the power of the spoken language, the job of a secretary would likely take the opposite path: the woman will work as a spokesman, working on a secretive background, leading a tight budget, and working with a diverse assortment of people. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know what a secretary is. A secretary is a person who works as a administrative member of a corporate office or part-time position (such as a secretary) or as an assistant to a secretary. Therefore, based on these two factors, we can conclude that a secretary job may be suited to someone with a wide range of interests, from publishing to art and beauty. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",

Li Ye (; died 784), also known by her courtesy name Li Jilan (\u674e\u5b63\u862d), was a Tang dynasty Chinese poet, Taoist nun, courtesan, and entertainer who was known for her talent in poetry as well as her beauty.
