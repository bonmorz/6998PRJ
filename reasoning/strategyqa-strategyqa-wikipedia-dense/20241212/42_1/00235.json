        "First, we need to know what mongoose is and what is known about it. Mongoose is a fish species found in Asia, Africa, and North America. Its name means the \"famous suk-suk-or-king monkey\". Since mongoose comes from southern Africa, it's possible that it is also coming from Asia or other western regions. Furthermore, some cultures in Asia come from different parts of Africa. Mongoose is native to Africa and Asia but seems relatively to be from eastern regions of North Africa. However, these populations do not come from the southern African or North East African continents, hence why the question is so important. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, mongoose came from laterally from Asian countries or elsewhere. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, the date of mongoose infeterization is generally dated between the years - approximately the late-1700s - to the late 19th century. Furthermore, mongoose has a relatively rosy temperament. Secondly, the date of the repopulation of monkeys is typically a different time than rhinos, as they mature in the southeastern time zone. Thus, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to establish where the Mongoose came from. The Mongoose was found in North America during the pre-Centurrican period in the mid-1800s to mid-twenti century. Therefore, there is no clear evidence as to whether Mongoose came from the pre-Cenric period than the rhinoceros. In fact, we can say based on some facts and facts, that Mongoose came from the late pre-Cenrican period, while rhinos came from the adolescence of the wild animals around the time of the birth of the Mongoose. This means that Mongoose came during the late part of the 18th century. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Mongoose does not come from the late period than the rhinoceros. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know what Mongoose and rhinos come from. Mongoose are native to the Northern region, and have been found throughout Europe and North Africa. Next, we need to determine how long it takes for a monkey to enter the wild world. Mongoose is a single, male mammal \u2013 meaning that it is typically found from about 8 to 12 months. It also has a relatively long life span ranging from 4 years to 4 years. There is no evidence to suggest that it has ever been found within the northern region of Newfoundland. The answer to the question is (B) no, the Mongoose came from the Northern region of Newfoundland. However, there are some theories that it came from a time period of evolution that has been a long process of evolution, wherein the monkey's age is usually present from around the time of the leopard and the leopard to his age. However, there is no reliable evidence to suggest that it was the monkey that came from the Eastern region that the Mongoose came from. According to these recent studies, they found that the monkey lived throughout the Northern region, and monkeys came from the Northern region where the Mongoose live from around the time of the leopard's birth. Thus, the answer to the question is (B) yes, monkeyse have existed between 8 and 12 years of age, while rhinos came from the Southern region when the Mongoose did not, leading us to say that it is possible that it did not come from the Northern region of Newfoundland during the past year. Thus, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to identify what the second and third dates to come from. Since mongoose have very few bodies, their bodies have never evolved from a species with very large bodies. This means that mongoose did not come from the second and third dates to later periods, which means that it is not possible for some species to come from the second period to modern time. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the second date would have come from a specific event that may have occurred during the same period. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, mongoose came from the fourth and fifth days of the second period. Answer: A"

        "White-tailed mongoose . Knowledge of the reproduction of the white tailed mongoose is incomplete. Litters are seen most frequently from February to May, and no young appear at all during the dry season from August to November, which suggests that they only breed once a year. The young are fully weaned at nine months of age, and around this time, the young disperse. It is speculated that sexual maturity is reached before two years of age, and that the gestation period is around 60 days."
