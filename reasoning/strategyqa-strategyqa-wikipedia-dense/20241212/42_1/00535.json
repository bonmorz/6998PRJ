        "Stephen Gendin . Gendin, despite not having a medical degree, had already been recognized as a genius and was offered membership into Mensa. After learning at age 19 that he was infected with HIV, Gendin quickly became at least as well informed about the latest HIV medical research as many leading HIV specialists, and remained so until his death. Gendin understood (as few others do to this day) that HIV diagnostic tests detect not the HIV virus but HIV's human antibodies, which do not exist in sufficient quantity for a \"positive\" HIV test result until between two and twenty-four weeks after HIV infection. During this immensely variable \"window period,\" people infected with HIV test \"negative\" because they have very few antibodies fighting the virus, as a direct consequence of which they also have very high levels of HIV in their bodies. These recently infected persons are usually unaware that they are infected at all, and firmly though wrongly believe that recent \"HIV-negative\" test results \"prove\" that they are not infected and cannot infect others."
