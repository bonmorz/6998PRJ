        "Firstly, it is important to understand that a torso is the outermost part of a body compared to the smallest bone which makes up the whole structure. Therefore, the torso could be safe from the blows to the biggest and smallest bones in a body compared to the smallest and smallest bones. The torso may be part of the larger bones which make up the torso. Therefore, the answer is yes to the question. Answer: B",
        "First, the torso is the most important piece of the body that we hold in position. Initially, we want to know if it's safe to let the small, circular bones blow to the largest and smallest bones in the body. Next, we need to know that the torso is not the primary body. It is the largest, elongated and largest part of the body, and it is responsible for the vitality flow of energy around the body. However, once we know these things, we can take it as a compliment to our understanding of what can cause a blow to the smallest and largest bones. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the torso is not safe from blows to the largest and smallest bones in the body. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what the torso is. It consists of the head, nose, and ear. Next, we need to understand what is called the \"larger bones in the body,\" which includes the head, nose, and ribs. Lastly, we need to understand what the sternum is. The sternum is a long-angulized bone that is connected to the body's lower ribs. It is also called the \"bone of the upper rib.\" Finally, we need to understand the different parts of the body that are affected. These parts have different parts, such as the torso and spine. However, it is still important to note that these bones are actually different parts of the body and are not directly affected by blows. Thus, it may be safe to assume that the torso would be safe from blows to the largest and smallest bones in the body. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "The torso is a part of the body and is located in the center of the body. You have a body that features a large, wide and flat rectus bone in the center, which is a part of the sternum or chest. When you suck on the sternum, you feel the thorax in the neck, and the sternum is a part of the body, known as the drench. Therefore, in order to answer this question, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what the torso is. The torso is made up of the large, flat bones. Next, we need to understand what the genitals are. The torso is a common organ that is located at the bottom of the chest and supports the brain. Therefore, it would be important to know what the genitals are. It is not possible for a thorax to be sagging or knocked by a blow. Therefore, the torso is safe from a blow to the largest and smallest bones in the body. This will take place during a blow. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, the torso is safe from blows to the larger and smallest genitals in the body. Answer: B"

        "Sternum . The sternum or breastbone is a long flat bone located in the center of the chest. It connects to the ribs via cartilage and forms the front of the rib cage, thus helping to protect the heart, lungs, and major blood vessels from injury. Shaped roughly like a necktie, it is one of the largest and longest flat bones of the body. Its three regions are the manubrium, the body, and the xiphoid process. The word \"sternum\" originates from the Greek \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, meaning \"chest\"."
