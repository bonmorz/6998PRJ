        "I will mention this specific question for now as I'm trying to answer this question (with knowledge of colitis), and I think a lot of people are trying to avoid a cold because of their bad diet habits. But in the context of the colitis debate, I think avoiding kola nuts is not the best option. I think a colitis diagnosis is a good option to get rid of. It's not true that kola nuts can be associated with colitis. A colitis diagnosis is more likely due to the combination of the underlying condition and a person's well-being, according to research on kola nuts. However, in light of this, it's not clear if kola nuts are associated with colitis, or if they are associated with a risk of colitis. Unlike other types of allergies, colitis mainly involves developing a body of their own underlying conditions. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Colva nut (\"colca\" nut\") are a nut that contains sugar, while kola (or a tree) is a tree of the temperate rainforest of Southeast Asia. Colitis is a common inflammatory condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract.

Thus, the answer to the question is (A) yes, you should avoid kola nut with colitis. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to understand what colitis is. Colitis is a medical condition that affiates an individual with a medical condition and can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or viruses. The kola nut is a fruit that is commonly consumed in yak or sardia fruits as well as in the wild. These nutrients can be found in the wild, or in fruit in the wild. Furthermore, kola nuts are known to have a beneficial effect on choking and/or stomach aches, which is why it is recommended to avoid kola nuts with colitis. Accordingly, we should have noted that it is important to note that colitis does not require any medical therapy or medication to achieve optimal efficacy. Instead, we should recommend that we avoid a sweetened kola nut with coke. We can go through different kola nut alternatives in order to be familiar with a different one. Instead, we should consider more traditional approaches like combining fruits and vegetables. It may sound counter-productive, but in these cases, there is no such requirement. The ideal way to avoid colitis is to reduce consumption of sugars and processed foods, such as processed foods, processed foods, and other processed foods, instead of having a sweetened kola nut with colitis. Next, we need to consider the risk of colitis. While this isn't harmful to me or anyone, it is not necessarily a bad risk. My answer to the question is (A) yes, it is possible to avoid kola nuts with colitis, because they have an important part in the medical treatment of colitis. Answer: A",
        "- We know that kola nuts and colitis are food products that can trigger gastrointestinal discomfort. - This is because the colitis ingestion is often exacerbated by certain conditions (i.e., high fever, phlegm level, and delirium). - Kola nuts contain a variety of ingredients, including a rare tree-god, caffeine, cinnamon, walnut, and other fruit, all of which help prevent the development of colitis. - To prevent the development of colitis in children, it is not always feasible to remove the fruit from its leaves and other components, because it is a particularly serious, non-toxic source of any disease. - Furthermore, a small handful of kola nuts may give the child a few seeds of a healthy dose, which means that they may have increased risk of colon enrotation and decompression. However, due to the small number of kola nuts required to be eaten, it is not always appropriate to eat them. Therefore, based on this information, we can safely assume that, for a healthy population, kola nuts would not lead to a fatal occurrence. The answer is (B) no, it is not a viable option to intake of kola nut-based foods. Answer: B"
