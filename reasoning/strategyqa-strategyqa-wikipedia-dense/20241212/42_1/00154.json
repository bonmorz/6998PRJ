        "First, we need to understand what the skull is. A skull is a large, skeletal structure that consists of three segments, and the cranium and the facial bones. Next, we need to consider whether or not one of the 22 bones that form the skull is a part of the skeleton. Each bone is a distinct body part, which means that they are different from each other and therefore differ in size. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (A) yes, the skull is formed as one whole bone. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to define what the skull has in it. The skull includes the largest portion of the skull. However, there are other parts of the skull, such as the head and neck, that are still contained inside a bone. The head and neck are also involved with the skull. Therefore, this question is not about whether it is formed as one whole bone. A single skull can consist of a few parts: the cranium, the skull, and the upper jaw. Now, let's determine what each part of the skull has in it. The skull, the upper jaw, is the most important part of the skull. However, since the bones are not integrated in one single single part of the skull, the answer is (A) yes. Since the skull is formed only as one, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what a skull is. A skull is a solid-body solid shaped structure that includes the cranial cavity, the facial bones, and the cranial skeleton. Next, we need to consider the structure of the skull. The skull is basically a large rock with some underlying bones in it. This includes the cranial cavity, the mouth cavity, and the mt. During the burial process, the bones are drilled into the skull and shaped like a circle. The bones are drilled in layers, often using hand tools and hand sewing tools. Now, the next question is about the size and shape of the skull. With all the bones being drilled in, they are essentially a triangle that is shaped like a rectangle, with the largest bone being a large, circular base, which is shaped like a square. Now, the answer is (B) no. The skull has an inflated notch at the bottom, which is where the cranial cavity is, making it easier to access. Answer: B",
        "One way to know which bones the skull contains is that they are called bons. One of the most important bones of the body is the cranium, which is a part of the human body. This chunk of bone is known as the cranium. This is part of the skull, and not only is it a part of the body's apex. So, to answer the question that we ask, the answer is \"no\". Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what the skull is. The skull is made of plates, which are a common feature of human skulls. Next, we need to understand what a basic skeleton is. A basic skull is a bone-shaped skull. It consists of several bones, including the crotum, the stoic bone, and the coccus (orcemic bone). Next, we need to understand what the skeleton is. The skull is made up of a variety of bones. They contain bones such as the skull base, upper jaw, tibia, and humpbackbone. Also, the skull is made up of a few bones, including the flange and ear. Finally, we need to consider the body's structure. The skull is a single bone, with six bones and a full head. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the skull is not formed as one whole bone. Answer: B"

        "Axial skeleton . The human skull consists of the cranium and the facial bones. The cranium holds and protects the brain in a large space called the cranial vault. The cranium is formed from eight plate-shaped bones which fit together at meeting points (joints) called sutures. In addition there are 14 facial bones which form the lower front part of the skull. Together the 22 bones that compose the skull form additional, smaller spaces besides the cranial vault, such as the cavities for the eyes, the internal ear, the nose, and the mouth. The most important facial bones include the jaw or mandible, the upper jaw or maxilla, the zygomatic or cheek bone, and the nasal bone."
