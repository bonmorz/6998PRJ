        "First of all, silicone suits are very breathable, and are not known for making swimmers more comfortable. Next, we need to consider judo. Judo is a form of martial art that involves balancing the physical forces of one opponent using two opposing players. In its essence, a swimmer has a body of their own to work through. Next, we can look at a study performed by UFC judo and how many swimmers there are in the class. These two examples indicate the different kinds of skills that one athlete uses to compete. Overall, the answer to the question is (B) yes, silicone suits make judo difficult, regardless of the suit\u2019s material and features. It is recommended that one wears a silicone suit and not use a drag suit. Given this information, the correct answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what judo is. Judo is a sport that involves movement, jumping, and physical symmetry, and is usually done using a ball or other type of weapon. Since the silicone suit does not make it possible for the swimminger to grip anything with it, it is unlikely that judo can be difficult. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, silicone suits do not make judo difficult. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, silicone suits are worn during the initial stages of development. They are designed to fit swimmers so it is easier to move around in them, making judo easier. Next, a step on the scale is measuring the resistance of judo training. According to American Wrestling Council, judo is a sport that requires strong resistance, but does not involve any form of physical resistance. Secondly, silicone suits are designed to improve the physical meter of swimmers, allowing them to focus on their techniques, without suffering any physical discomfort. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand the role of drag suits to judo. Drag suits are typically designed to fit a specific type of swimmer, so it's important to have a hard stance to attempt to avoid it. However, since these suits do not provide the same resistance as normal swimsuits, it's not necessary for swimmers to wear drag suits while swimming. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is \"yes\". However, the answer to this question is (A) no, silicone suits do not make judo difficult, so it's not necessary for swimmers to wear drag suits. Answer: A",
        "1. What is judo? Judo is a physical exercise using punching shoes and other protective clothing to improve the strength and defense of your body and make the movement less difficult. 2. Therefore, Silicone suits made of rubber provide additional strength and are significantly less invasive than normal suits. 3. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no, silicone suits cannot make judo difficult. 4. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, silicone suits do not make judo difficult. Answer: B"

        "Competitive swimwear . A drag suit is a pair of baggy squarecut or brief-style trunks that competitive swimmers may wear over their normal suit to provide extra resistance (\"drag\") from the water. This allows the swimmer to get more out of their training than they would without a drag suit. Drag suits are meant to be worn over a long period of time to wear in the material and possibly tear the fabric. The more worn-in, torn or ripped the drag suit, the more resistance it provides the swimmer. Since drag suits make swimming more difficult, swimmers do not wear drag suits in competition. Drag suits originated as older swimsuits at the end of their useful life that swimmers would then wear over another suit."
