        "First, we need to understand what bumblebees are. Bumblebees are a type of bee that is active in sexual reproduction that requires feeding around the wings. They have an aggressive personality which is why it is hard for them to be aggressive. Next, we need to understand what is suicidal. Suicide refers to a behaviour that involves using orallying a plant for a purpose. As such, it is essential to observe what kind of behavior the bees tend to be able to achieve. During this time, the bumblebees are capable of sexual reproduction that requires little activity or time. Typically, the bees are attracted to a specific plant or leaf from which they find their way to its seed. This behavior is usually seen at the beginning of a sexual reproduction, when it is accompanied by strong, uncontrollable behavior or behavior. However, this behavior is not always the case when it is appropriate to initiate sexual reproduction. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, aggressive bumblebees have not developed their natural ability to seek for food or support. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what a bumblebee is. Bumblebees are a type of bee that has a suction cup that acts as a suction cup to help with yelling. When it is not called, it has a loud, strong, booming wing called the vent, which can be heard making a booming noise. Next, we need to determine whether or not aggressive bumblebees exist. These bees are known for their aggressive behaviors, which make it possible for them to be suicidal. Whether or not aggressive bumblebees should be considered aggressive is not an objective scientific knowledge, nor does it require an understanding of what a suction cup would be. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, aggressive bumblebees are not suicidal. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define what is suicidal behavior. Supremacy is the behavior that an animal would do if not for the behavior. Bumblebees are very supple and can be found in different habitats and habitats. Therefore, the answer is (B) yes, aggressive bumblebees do not seek to befriend other bees. Thus, the correct answer is (B) yes, aggressive bumblebees are not suicidal. Instead, they seek to find another possible body or habitat that is not aggressive or can be found. Answer: B",
        "First, what is suicidal behavior? Bimbobees have no common form of behavior or behavior when attacking each other, but rather are more aggressive and suicidal in nature. Therefore, based on the evidence presented above, we know that aggressive bumblebees are suicidal bees. Their actions are primarily for the sake of their long, deep thirst for nectar, and they may not be as aggressive as bimbobees. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, not aggressive bumblebees are suicidal. Answer: B",
        "Bumblebees are typically herbivorous bumblebees that are similar in their physical traits and behaviors. They tend to be herbivorous in their natural defenses such as consuming nectar, shedding, and scenting nectar, which is a traditional instinct for all bumblebees to produce. Bumblebees have a shorter tongue and have a greater suction at resting than most other bumblebees. Also, they may lick or lick a seed, which can be highly deprecating or harmful to some bumblebees. Bumblebees are a diverse animal and have a strong sense of direction, so that they can be dangerous. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, aggressive bumblebees are not suicidal. It is common for these animals to be habituated and do not respond to aggression or try to provoke them. Firstly, the physical doctrines of bees do not belong to bees, nor do they use their tongues as a stepping stone. However, bees could be using their tongues as a weapon and may find themselves being rewarded when their free-way contact may help them. Next, the question is likely to be asked about bee behavior. Bumblebees are small, small, and typically do not pick up a leaf or fruit, which are used for oozing and consuming nectar, which is typically a response to disturbance or injury. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, aggressive bumblebees are not suicidal. Answer: B"

        "Bumblebee . The bumblebee tongue (the proboscis) is a long, hairy structure that extends from a sheath-like modified maxilla. The primary action of the tongue is lapping, that is, repeated dipping of the tongue into liquid.  The tip of the tongue probably acts as a suction cup and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like Bombus bifarius, have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, which resulted in a small reward."
