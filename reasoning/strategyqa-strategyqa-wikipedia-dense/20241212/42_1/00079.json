        "First of all, it's important to recognize the structure and function of the human sacrum. The human sacrum is part of the nervous system, a part of the vertebrae. Next, it's important to know where the humans are located and what their fate is. The human sacrum is the skeletal structure inside of the body, including the lungs and heart. The Alaskan Malamute is a small creature with a spinal cord attached to its back and limbs. This animal sacrum is part of the lungs, spinal cord, spinal cord, and limbs. Next, we know that humans and mice have different type of mammals with different types of vertebrae. However, the human sacrum has different bone fragments and limbs and muscle tissues. Therefore, the answer of the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what an Alaskan Malamute is. An Alaskan Malamute is a species of animal that is known for having long and fused vertebrae. Now, we need to understand the similarities and differences between the sacrum and the fish sacrrum. The sacrum is a thin cavity in the animal's chest, which is covered with fibres, a few of them fused, and two additional vertebrae. Next, we need to determine the amount of fused vertebrae. This is the amount of vertebrae that are fused to each bone. It may be different in a human sacrculosus, but it's not necessarily the case. Therefore, it's not necessarily necessary for an animal to have more fused vertebrae. The answer is either (A) yes, an Alaskan Malamute has more fused vertebrae than a human sacrum. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to know what the human sacrum is. A sacrum is an artificial structure that includes bones attached to limbs. Next, we need to consider an Alaskan Malamute. An Alaska Malamute is a large, terrestrial animal that is a terrestrial horse or cattle breed that has a long leg and a neck. In a human body, there are fused vertebrae attached to the limbs of the animal. Next, we need to consider the function of the human sacrum. In particular, a human sacrum has a skeleton that is more dense and shaped than the female sacrum. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, an Alaskan Malamute has more fused vertebrae than a human sacrum. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to determine the size and height of an Alaskan Malamute. There are approximately 4,200 to 7 trillion sea turtles and mammals. In general, we can assume that humans have about 65,000 square foot (141,000 to 212,000 square meter) of spine. Based on our analysis of the different vertebrates, it is concluded that human sacrums have around 700 fused vertebrae. This means that compared to an Alaskan Malamute, mandible humans only have about 40,000 finches a week. As an alternative, we believe that people with a larger number of finches may be better off with a larger, more feathered person. In contrast, in a human sacrum, the finches are more fused than humans due to their greater number of bones. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. In order to understand this, we need to consider some common facts and evidence on the ground. The physical size of the sacrum, as well as the shape and weight of the body, should be based on their shape and size. The following information about humans and animal sacrums is relevant to understand this question and information: In conclusion, compared to the relevant information, we can conclude that human sacrums have more fused vertebrae than an Alaskan Malamute. Thus, the answer to the question is (B) no, human sacrums have more fused vertebrae than an Alaskan Malamute. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what an Alaskan Malamute is. An Alaskan Malamute is an animal that contains a large caudal or lumbar vertebrae that fused to a systic or sacrum. A human sacrum is the large, fluid structure of a human or chimpanee. So, the answer to the question is (A) yes, an Alaskan Malamute has more fused vertebrae than a human sacrum. Answer: A"

        "Synsacrum . The synsacrum is a skeletal structure of birds and other dinosaurs, in which the sacrum is extended by incorporation of additional fused or partially fused caudal or lumbar vertebrae. The innominate bones are fused with the synsacrum to a greater or lesser extent, according to species, forming an avian pelvis. This forms a more extensive rigid structure than the pelvis of a mammal, fulfilling requirements for flight, locomotion and respiration. Posterior to the synsacrum there are a few free caudal vertebrae, the last of which is the pygostyle to which the long, stiff tail feathers are attached. The central section of the synsacrum is swollen to accommodate the glycogen body, an organ whose function is as yet unclear but which may be associated with balance."
