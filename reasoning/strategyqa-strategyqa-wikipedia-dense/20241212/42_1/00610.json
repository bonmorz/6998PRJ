        "First, we need to understand what a QR code is. A QR code is a code that consists of a series of dots. Next, we need to know the shape of the code that the readers see. QR code code is not designed for a specific type of material, but it is a set of dots, typically shaped around a rectangular base, that is, as the example of this type of code appears. In our example, we can see that the dots on the side of the code are made up of curved dots. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, you have to put on glasses to read a QR code. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a QR code is. QR codes are a bar code used for detecting text messages and typing. Next, we need to understand what a QR code is and how it can be read. A QR code is a text message. The QR code is a code that can be interpreted via a QR menu. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, you do need to put on glasses to read a QR code. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what a QR code is. QR codes are a type of text or image that can be found by pressing a button or device on a computer. Next, we need to understand what the QR codes are. They are a type of text or image that can contain information such as information and location. QR codes are also known as \"Rapid Data,\" or QR code. On the other hand, QR codes are used to encode information such as medical information or personal information. When these forms inevitably feature in a printed document, there is no need to attach a device or equipment to put them on. Next, we have to consider the size and shape of a QR code. QR codes can be made up of a smaller than the size of a square or rectangular. This may make the codes a bit harder to read than it would be. Since this is a larger than the usual size, it is possible that some people may be tempted to look at QR codes and see how difficult it is to read them. The difference is that a QR code can be printed out in smaller quantities and therefore require more careful reading if the code is complex to read. Considering these factors, we can conclude that a QR code is indeed a QR code. However, based on these facts and tools, we can conclude that we do not need to put on the appropriate glasses to read a QR code. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a QR code is, a code that is used to type in and find a specific location. Now, let's think of an example. A QR code is a short barcode code that is used to make the correct identification of a certain location. The bar code cannot be read from a QR code, so it is likely not safe or reasonable to have the codes read from. Next, we need to check the correctness of the code if we find one that is wrong or incorrect. Since the code is not correctly read, it can be difficult or impossible for someone to read it properly. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, you do need to put on a pair of glasses. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to define what a QR code is. QR codes have short codes or segments that provide information and code for specific purposes. Next, we need to determine the size of the QR code. The IQR code has a width of about 5x4 with a width of 150 meters. So, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "QR code . IQR Code is an alternative to existing QR codes developed by Denso Wave. IQR codes can be created in square or rectangular formations; this is intended for situations where a rectangular barcode would otherwise be more appropriate, such as cylindrical objects. IQR codes can fit the same amount of information in 30% less space. There are 61 versions of square IQR codes, and 15 versions of rectangular codes. For squares, the minimum size is 9x9 modules; rectangles have a minimum of 19x5 modules. IQR codes add error correction level S, which allows for 50% error correction. IQR Codes have not yet been given an ISO specification, and only proprietary Denso Wave products can create or read IQR codes."
