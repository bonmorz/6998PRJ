        "First, let's get back to the question. Ahura Mazda is the deity of Zoroastrianism, the highest of the Apohranian gods, who is the most eminent in the region of Arslan. Next, we need to understand that Ahura Mazda is a deity that was created by the Apohranian Empire and has been the deity of the king and the goddess of the earth since the creation of the Holy Spirit. The king of Arslan's reign is not mentioned in the question, but it is considered the god of the king's and his successor, Achura Mazda. Now, we know that Ahura Mazda has a rivalry with Zeus. The first sign of Ahura Mazda is that they were created by a powerful god called Amara, which is a deity of the gods. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, Ahura Mazda has a rivalry with Zeus. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what Ahura Mazda is. Ahura Mazda is a deity in Zoroastrianism. Next, we need to understand the conflict that was created between Ahura Mazda and Zeus. Ahura Mazda was ruled by the Greek god Apollo, whose heirs were emperor of the Achaemonu clan, and the latter was the ruler of the Azores, who ordered the Earth to rebuild itself. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Ahura Mazda has any rivalry with Zeus, as it could happen to both. Additionally, the word \"vengement\" has been used in many cultures in the past to refer to a dual identity. However, there is no evidence or support to suggest that Ahura Mazda had any conflict with Zeus because Ahura Mazda had more power than Zeus. Therefore, it is the correct answer and correct answer to question (B) - Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine who Ahura Mazda is and why Zeus is the god of god and deed. To confirm this, we need to verify that Ahura Mazda has a rival with Zeus, so it's safe to say they are close minded and they tend to disagree. However, since Ahura Mazda is a famous god, it is not likely that they are in competitive with the same deity. Therefore, we know that Ahura Mazda is not necessarily a rival with Zeus, so we can say that Ahura Mazda's rival with Zeus is likely true. If we assume that Ahura Mazda and Zeus are both a deity, we would assume that Ahura Mazda and Zeus would be rivals. We can assume that Ahura Mazda was one of the original deities that made up the mythical god of god and deed, and Zeus was also considered a deity. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Ahura Mazda is not rival with Zeus. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, we need to consider what Ahura Mazda is. Ahura Mazda is a deity known to be very powerful. He is known to have been the ruler of the Earth during the Roman Empire, but has not been associated with Zeus. Next, we have to consider the meaning of the word 'bring-and-take'. 'bring' means something that means to be fought against by a rival, either of a god or their enemy, and hence a rival. There are many gods out there, but Ahura Mazda is the same as Zeus. Ahura Mazda has many different qualities, as is mighty, independent and omnipresent in the universe. Hence, the logical answer to this question is (B) no, Ahura Mazda has not had a rivalry with Zeus. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what Ahura Mazda is. Ahura Mazda is the god of the god of the world, and in Zoroastrianism, he is considered to be the god of the mighty. However, since Ahura Mazda has an omnipotent incarnation, the question is not related to anything specific about the omnipotent incarnation of Ahura Mazda or the omnipotent Zeus. Therefore, the answer is \"Yes. Answer: A"

        "Deity . Ahura Mazda (); is the Avestan name for the creator and sole God of Zoroastrianism. The literal meaning of the word \"\" is \"mighty\" or \"lord\" and \"\" is \"wisdom\". Zoroaster, the founder of Zoroastrianism, taught that Ahura Mazda is the most powerful being in all of the existence and the only deity who is worthy of the highest veneration. Nonetheless, Ahura Mazda is not omnipotent because his evil twin brother Angra Mainyu is nearly as powerful as him. Zoroaster taught that the \"daevas\" were evil spirits created by Angra Mainyu to sow evil in the world and that all people must choose between the goodness of Ahura Mazda and the evil of Angra Mainyu. According to Zoroaster, Ahura Mazda will eventually defeat Angra Mainyu and good will triumph over evil once and for all. Ahura Mazda was the most important deity in the ancient Achaemenid Empire. He was originally represented anthropomorphically, but, by the end of the Sasanian Empire, Zoroastrianism had become fully aniconic."
