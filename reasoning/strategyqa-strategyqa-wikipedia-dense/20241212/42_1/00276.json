        "First, General Zod is a geek who has a fascination with technology and technology. He is a frequent critic of Android, which is a mobile device with a built-in android processor, and it is his favorite phone. Next, he uses the Apple App Store to access his personal apps. The app uses an interface similar to Apple's popular iOS App. Additionally, it allows him to create his own customized iPhone or iPad design and create his own iPhone's custom designs. In short, General Zod prefers an iPhone rather than a Samsung Galaxy S4. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, we need to understand what a smartphone is. A smartphone is a piece of technology that would have been considered an accessory to anyone's personal life. So, the term \"itunes\" suggests that General Zod would have preferred a smartphone to a Samsung Galaxy S4. This was not given specific order, so we can assume that his opinion was just based on the screen in general. Moreover, the question was not specific to the phone itself, but rather comparing it with the Galaxy S4, like what we can now read about. In the Galaxy, the phone has a larger screen, which means it is a bigger phone and a smaller screen. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, General Zod would prefer an iPhone over a Galaxy S4. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine who is General Zod. Zod is a former celebrity and former comedian who is a good friend to various celebrities, such as George Lucas and Adam Vinnock. Then, based on their recent reviews and phone interviews, we can understand the reasoning behind the question. They believe that the device is primarily designed for communication, such as emoji, graphics, and audio, rather than simply audio. Therefore, we can assume that General Zod would prefer an iPhone over a Samsung Galaxy S4 because his phone could be highly mobile and have an edge with a much wider range. Therefore, we can assume that would be more likely to be compatible with a Galaxy S4 than an iPhone. However, for a phone like the Samsung Galaxy S4, a person would be less likely to prefer an iPhone because it is cheaper and lighter. Therefore, it is safe to say that it is unlikely to be compatible with an iPhone, as it will likely cost more, whereas a similar iPhone would likely not cost more money for an device. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. The answer is (B) yes. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine the phone that is mentioned above. We find the Samsung Galaxy S4, which is a similar device to the Samsung Galaxy S7. This phone is larger than the Galaxy S7 in terms of price, battery life, and price-performance relative to the iPhone. Now we can look at the specifications of the phone. The Asus iPhone has a 3G speed-to-full compatibility compared to the Galaxy S7. Samsung's Galaxy S4 has a 3G connectivity compared to the Galaxy S4, making the device significantly higher priced than the Galaxy S4. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what the iPhone is. An iPhone is a smartphone that combines a smart phone, a screen, and a smartphone. A Smartphone is generally designed to be portable and portable, making it useful for any type of use the consumer has come to love. Next, we need to consider what a reputable tech company like Apple Inc. specializes in mobile technology. Google, the largest computer software company and the largest technology company for wireless systems, are all companies that manufacture products from a range of devices, such as the iPhone. Google's products are often placed in the hands and wrists of users, including customers, who have access to wireless communication devices, such as smartphones or tablets. These devices are widely used throughout the world, but are generally fairly affordable for those who prefer a mobile device. As a company, we would need to be aware of the cost and the cost of developing products such as smartphones or tablets. While this may not be a real user benefit, a phone, such as the iPhone, will cost more than a tablet or a smartphone. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Huawei Honor 8 . Honor 8 has been compared to the Samsung Galaxy S7 and iPhone. \"Fast Company\" Harry McCracken, who tested a \"pre-release\" version of the phone, was impressed and called the Honor 8 worthy competitor to the more expensive Samsung Galaxy S7. Matthew Miller of ZDNet appreciated the phone's appearance and value. He called the model a \"fingerprint magnet\", but opined, \"phones like this are really going to make people question paying double for the latest Samsung Galaxy or Apple iPhone\"."
