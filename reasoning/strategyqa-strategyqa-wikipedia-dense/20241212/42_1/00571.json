        "First, we have the topic of Hugh Jackman. Since Hugh Jackman is known for being one of the greatest comedians of all time, he was known for his charisma, humor, and skillful storytelling skills. Since the book was written by one of the best writers ever, it's possible that Jackman had been a teacher at some point in the book before it was published.

        "The Great Gatsby . Fitzgerald's visits to Long Island's north shore and his experience attending parties at mansions inspired \"The Great Gatsby\"s setting. Today, there are a number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book. One possibility is Land's End, a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party. Many of the events in Fitzgerald's early life are reflected throughout \"The Great Gatsby\". Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota, and, like Nick, he was educated at an Ivy League school, Princeton (in Nick's case, Yale). Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loved. Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant and was stationed at Camp Sheridan in Montgomery, Alabama. There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen-year-old beauty named Zelda Sayre. Zelda finally agreed to marry him, but her preference for wealth, fun, and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success. Like Nick in \"The Great Gatsby\", Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting, and, like Gatsby, he had always idolized the very rich. In many ways, \"The Great Gatsby\" represents Fitzgerald's attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age. Like Gatsby, Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted, even as she led him toward everything he despised."
