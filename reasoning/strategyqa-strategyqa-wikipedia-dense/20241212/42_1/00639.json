        "First, we need to understand the anatomy of a goblin shark. This shark is named after its powerful predator. Next, we need to understand the body language of a goblin shark. It has limbs and head for that reason. Therefore, it is unlikely that a goblin shark would be capable of physically tackling the object of its attack. It is important to note that a goblin shark is highly capable of being aggressive and dangerous during attacks, so they would be unable to yank the opponent's limbs. So, to answer this question, we must answer by using three different possible scenarios. First, we need to consider the limbs and size of the shark's body. The skull and limbs of the gobble sharks are very strong, almost a single ring of ice or wax on each edge of its body. Similarly, the spinal cord is relatively short, and the skull is shaped entirely in a close, looping position. Therefore, the skeleton can hold the limbs securely while the goblin shark could whizz away. However, the correct answer is (B) no. In conclusion, we can assume that a live goblin shark has very densely constructed limbs and only has a handful of limbs. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the goblin shark could physically physically mate up to a bike. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to identify if the Goblin shark is a predator in the ocean and has a clear area that would have allowed it to practice its maneuvering behavior. This is not really known, as sharks often bite humans or other animals, such as dogs. Next, we need to determine if the bike itself has wheels, meaning it could have the ability to ride a bike through a bike or foot. If the Goblin shark has wheels, it could have the ability to ride a bike, which would have enabled it to navigate into a more difficult terrain. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to identify what a Goblin Shark is, a sea-toothed shark that is known to be hard-nosed, and is known for its ability to pierce small bodies. Next, we need to find a shark's weight. This is a shark in smaller and less-observable species, called anasceusans, which can be found in the wild. Using these details, we can conclude that a Goblin shark would be able to ride a bike if it had limbs. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, a Goblin Shark would not be able to ride a bike if it had limbs. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know what a Goblin shark is. A Goblin shark is a large shark with a broad tibia on its ail and limbs on its body. Therefore, a Goblin shark could potentially physically attack a bike if it had a pair of limbs. Next, we need to consider the characteristics of a motor. Goblin sharks have a distinct slender skeleton and one single digits, which means that they have a very small range of motion in both its limbs and legs. In general, a tiger shark has the smallest skeleton and a larger slender digits on its limbs, while a shark could potentially potentially destroy an object or body that it has, such as an object or body. While it is unlikely that a Goblin shark would be able to physically attack a bike if it had limbs, it would be highly unlikely, as it would likely have no other limbs to hold onto or navigate a path. Furthermore, a Goblin shark would not arouse the desire to be threatened and attacked with a bike if it has limbs or body. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, a Goblin shark cannot logically ride a bike if it had any limbs with the limbs on it, since it has no limbs on its body and does not pose a risk to other animals. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, we need to understand what a Goblin shark is. A Goblin shark is a large, salty shark that lays in sandy beaches. In contrast, it is smaller, and thus it doesn't have the right to take a ride on a bike if it lacks any limbs. Secondly, we need to understand what a bike is. A bike is a type of motorcycle that contains wheels or tires, which is a type of gear that is used to move the bike. It is especially important to note that a Goblin shark is a large, salty shark, while it also lacks any legs or tires. Thus, it is highly unlikely that a Goblin shark would roll on a bike. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) yes. Answer: B"

        "Shark attack . Large sharks species are apex predators in their environment, and thus have little fear of any creature (other than orcas) with which they cross paths. Like most sophisticated hunters, they are curious when they encounter something unusual in their territories. Lacking any limbs with sensitive digits such as hands or feet, the only way they can explore an object or organism is to bite it; these bites are known as test bites. Generally, shark bites are exploratory, and the animal will swim away after one bite. For example, exploratory bites on surfers are thought to be caused by the shark mistaking the surfer and surfboard for the shape of prey. Nonetheless, a single bite can grievously injure a human if the animal involved is a powerful predator such as a great white or tiger shark."
