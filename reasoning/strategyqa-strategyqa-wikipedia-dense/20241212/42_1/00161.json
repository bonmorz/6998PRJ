        "First, we need to know who the Bonanza marathon is. The Bonanza marathon is the first long-running reality show in the world, spanning more than a week. This has occurred multiple times on television in recent years, from 2002 to 2009 to 2012. Next, we need to know who WWE Heat is. WWE Heat is a professional wrestling brand known for its hefty salary, unparalleled injury, and low pay. Therefore, the Bonanza marathon is the least successful in its endeavor, at the end of an ad campaign, and it is unlikely that a fan would have the time or money to pay for the marathon if it was planned to lapse in its scheduled run time. Thus, the answer is (A) yes, Bonanza marathon would extend its run time to a week after the completion of its run, with WWE Heat's scheduled run time of 31 days. Answer: A",
        "First of all, we need to understand what the Bonanza marathon is. A marathon is a weekly series with competitions lasting three to four weeks and usually last for one week. Now, we need to determine if the Bonanza marathon is a viable event that can be rerun. As a result, the Bonanza marathon is only effective if there is a series lasting three to six hours. Therefore, the answer is no. The answer to this question is \"yes,\" which is the correct answer. Since Bonanza is a traditional marathon event, the better choice is to rerun it after a series. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to consider the length of the Bonanza marathon marathon. A marathon marathon is often rerun at varying lengths, with some running in various times of day, including afternoon. Next, we need to consider the length of the WWE heat marathon. In addition, a WWE heat marathon is a weekly series that features one-time winner, ranked as the second-most-watches in the world. Therefore, a marathon marathon is a viable way to rerun an event and is sometimes called a \"reroll sleeep\" event, resulting in it ending with the elimination of the contest and the release of the match. If the game ends by a certain point, the show would fail to finish its time, thus avoiding the event. Furthermore, the WWE heat marathon is a reality show that features WWE live-show stars such as Mizmako and Omario, which would allow for more shows in the future to play in its first season. So, the answer is (B) no, Bonanza marathon would not end before WWE Heat marathon. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand the marathon and WWE Heat marathon. The Bonanza marathon is a massive series of television reality shows. The marathon is a rerun series of sports TV competitions, which are popular nationwide. Next, we need to understand what WWE and Bonanza are. Despite having a marathon TV show, Bonanza is a reality show, while WWE Heat consists of a week long tournament, which is not a fan favorite. Next, we need to know the difference between the marathon and WWE Heat. WWE Heat is a sports television series. The WWE Heat marathon is a reality show that focuses on wrestling contests. Therefore, Bonanza has a long running time if the marathon and WWE are reruns of the same event. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, Bonanza marathon must end before WWE Heat marathon. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine which marathon may end before WWE Heat, since it is a marathon event involving multiple shows, such as \"Joey Shore\" and \"Hoops on Rio\". Next, we need to consider the duration of the WWE Heat marathon. A WWE Heat marathon may be around 4-7 months. Next, we need to determine the length of the Bonanza marathon. Bonanza marathon is only around 168 hours, with the marathon lasting 7 weeks. This allows WWE to determine the completion time for each show. This is especially important for a franchise that is actively engaging in its own special elements, such as if they are planning on participating in their own show or contests or engaging with fans. Finally, we need to consider the timeline of each contest. The marathon usually runs for one night, often on a Saturday night, ending a week's series. This is not the event that ends on the final Thursday night, though. Since the show has been featured on multiple shows, we can expect this event to have a different ending. As such, based on their overall completion time, the WWE Heat marathon would have ended shorter than Bonanza marathon, thus increasing the chances of ending. The marathon has a goal in itself and the final two fight between them would be decided at the end of the series. Additionally, the marathon has a moral component in it, which helps maintain momentum. Furthermore, it is important to note that the marathon is rated a different time from the Heat episode (Female). The reality show has been in a prestigious place in the recent past, with the success factor a major factor behind the success of the series. However, the answer to this question is yes, it will not finish before WWE Heat marathon as their completion has been finished. Answer: B"

        "Marathon (media) . Marathons have proven to be a viable way of rerunning reality television contests, which have otherwise been relatively difficult to rerun in traditional forms (e.g. daily \"strip\" syndication) because of the loss of the element of surprise. In December 2012, MTV announced that it would air a seven-day (168-hour) marathon of \"Jersey Shore\" before the series finale on December 20, 2012; this marked one of the longest marathons in television history."
