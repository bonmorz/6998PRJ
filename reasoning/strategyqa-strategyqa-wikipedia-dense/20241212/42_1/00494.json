        "First, we need to understand what a snow leopard is. It is a reptile that has wings, and is generally found slender in length. Next, we need to consider the weight of a snow leopard. Snow leopards have an internal humerus gland, which allows them to carry their weight through the skin and move its digestive system. Therefore, the weight of a snow leopard is considered to be two times its own body weight. Thus, a snow leopard could eat twice its own body weight. The only other reason that snow leopards can eat twice their own body weight is because it is very crowded. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, the name of a snow leopard is \"Snow leopard\". It is an endangered species, and can easily eat twice its own body weight. The snow leopard is a large reptile, that weighs around 220 kilos (1070 lbs). Next, we need to look at the weight and weight of the snow leopard (based on body size) as well as the weight of the bears and turkeys. According to the Canadian Geographic and Cross-Registered Union, a snow leopard may not be able to eat the same weight as a bear, the same way as the size of a bear - it eats. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, snow leopard can eat twice its own body weight. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to identify what you are asking about. A snow leopard is a very small creature, typically found in the southeastern North American continent. Next, we need to note that snow leopards can lay eggs, which resemble the body of a human. Therefore, in order to eat twice its own body weight, a snow leopard can also lay eggs. As of 2018 the winter season is between spring and fall, and a snow leopard only eats two eggs, one of which is approximately 175 grams. This indicates that a snow leopard's body weight is considerably greater than that of an average human's body weight. However, if the snow leopard can lay eggs, it can lay up eggs, which means that it can weigh double the weight of a normal human. In other words, the snow leopard can only eat twice the weight of it. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what is \"supermum.\" It's a kind of natural gas that feeds humans. Next, we need to consider the gecko. Snow leopards are large, fat, and highly oblong, so they can eat two-fold their own body weight. So, if you compare a snow leopard to a snow leopard, you can know that one of these animals is a bit larger than the other. Second, snow leopards are more likely to eat than regular humans, meaning they can eat more than one of the two-billion-pound geckos, and while it's possible that a snow leopard could eat twice its own body weight, they can't be healthy enough for their own consumption. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, it's impossible for a snow leopard to eat twice its own body weight. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define what is meant by \"doubled body weight.\" Double body weight refers to the relative weight of an individual. The Snow leopard is about 8 grams long, about 200 grams wide, and is most commonly known as the Snow leopard gecko. Next, we need to define the weight of a snow leopard. Snow leopards have a weight of up to 220 grams, which means that the body weight of a snow leopard can be increased by up to an extra 4 kg (100,800) compared to the weight of a typical gecko. So, we can say that a snow leopard can eat twice its own body weight. A snow leopard eats a minimum of 3 times its body weight, which means that there is no indication in the body for eating twice its own body weight. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A"

        "Common leopard gecko . Common leopard geckos are larger than many other gecko species. Hatchlings are on average in length and weigh about 2 to 5\u00a0grams. Adult females are about in length and weigh about 50 to 70\u00a0grams, while adult male geckos are about in length and weigh about 60 to 80\u00a0grams. Those found in the wild typically have more dark, dull, and drab colorations than those kept in captivity as pets. Those in captivity generally have an assortment of skin colors and patterns. The skin of a common leopard gecko is very durable, which provides protection from the rough sand and rocky hills terrain of their dry environment. Their dorsal side is covered with small bumps, which gives a rough texture and appearance while their ventral side is thin, transparent, and smooth. Like all reptiles, common leopard geckos shed their skin. In the few days before the shedding, the skin will turn color to a translucent whitish gray. Adults shed an average of once a month, while juveniles will sometimes shed twice as much. The gecko will eat its old skin after shedding, revealing a brighter colored one. There are two theories of why common leopard geckos do this. One is that in the wild, common leopard geckos eat their shed skin so there is no trace that the common leopard gecko was there. The other theory is that eating the shed skin is a means for obtaining protein and other vitamins for growth."
