        "Snoop Dogg . When he began recording, Broadus took the stage name Snoop Doggy Dogg. Dr. Dre began working with Snoop Dogg, first on the theme song of the 1992 film \"Deep Cover\", and then on Dr. Dre's debut solo album \"The Chronic\" with the other members of his former starting group, Tha Dogg Pound. The huge success of Snoop Dogg's debut \"Doggystyle\" was partially because of this intense exposure. Fueling the ascendance of West Coast G-funk hip hop, the singles \"Who Am I (What's My Name)?\" and \"Gin and Juice\" reached the top ten most-played songs in the United States, and the album stayed on the Billboard charts for several months. Gangsta rap became the center of arguments about censorship and labeling, with Snoop Dogg often used as an example of violent and misogynistic musicians. Unlike much of the harder-edged gangsta rap artists, Snoop Dogg seemed to show his softer side, according to music journalist Chuck Philips. \"Rolling Stone\" music critic Tour\u00e9 asserted that Snoop had a relatively soft vocal delivery compared to other rappers: \"Snoop's vocal style is part of what distinguishes him: where many rappers scream, figuratively and literally, he speaks softly.\" \"Doggystyle\", much like \"The Chronic\", featured a host of rappers signed to or affiliated with the Death Row label including Daz Dillinger, Kurupt, Nate Dogg, and others."
