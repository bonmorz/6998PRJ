        "First, we know that snakes, or otherwise, do not have the full capabilities of a small mouth or jaw. Snakes usually have a wide jaw, especially for the digestive process. Now, we need to consider the morphology of a small mouth, or jaw. A small mouth is generally narrow and irregular, which means it can only be swallowed by the jaw. The size of the mouth is measured at a large height and can be weighed by weighings up to 2,000 ounces. The M60 is not the largest known snake. We cannot use the same basic body shape to make our snake swallow the M60. Hence, the answer is (B) no, a snake cannot swallow a M60 and cannot eat a large mouth. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what an M60 Patton is. A M60 Patton is a flying container used in the military and is located below the water level in the Philippines. It is a standard type of container used for military purpose, but it has a more compact housing and structure than an average pet. Therefore, it is not possible for a snake to swallow an M60 Patton. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, a shark is an aquatic fish, not a snake. The shark's head is large enough to break through the smallest of its prey. Now, after understanding what a snake is, we can see that a snake can also swallow an M60 Patton. It has a special type of protruding jaw which allows it to be close to the shark's head, which is larger than the shark's head. Next, we need to know what the M60 Patton is. A M60 Patton is a small sized ice-fish with a large tube-like shell that covers the shark's mouth. However, because a snake is too large to swallow its head, it cannot swallow the shells, so it can still travel through the shell to avoid being swallowed by the shark. Therefore, while it is possible to swallow an M60 Patton, it would not be safe for its shark-like jaw to stay through its shells, as it doesn't have any attachments to the jaw or spine from the ice. Thus, the answer to this question is (B) no, a snake can only swallow a fish. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand the shape of an M60 Parton. Unlike the normal sized snake, the M60 Parton is large and thus is not the smallest rattlesest. However, because the snake has a large body and can support its legs, it cannot swallow the M60 Parton. Consequently, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a M60 Patton is. Basically, it is a small, medium-sized flying object with a long jaw. At a glance, it shows how the upper surface of a snake mouth can be used to swallow a M60 Patton. Next, we need to evaluate what is it that the answer to the question asks. A snake can easily pick up and swallow the M60 Patton. However, it can also swallow other types of objects, such as eggshells, or other objects. It is important to note that snakes have a very wide grasping ability, especially compared to other species. Additionally, the animal with a strong tail can pick up and handle the M60 Patton without harming it or the object being ate or releasing them. For example, if you were to pick up a snake that has the same jaw that the M60 Patton, it would be much less likely for it to swallow the M60 Patton. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, the M60 Patton can swallow another snake. Answer: A"

        "Snake . The snake's jaw is a complex structure. Contrary to the popular belief that snakes can dislocate their jaws, snakes have a very flexible lower jaw, the two halves of which are not rigidly attached, and numerous other joints in their skull (see snake skull), allowing them to open their mouths wide enough to swallow their prey whole, even if it is larger in diameter than the snake itself. For example, the African egg-eating snake has flexible jaws adapted for eating eggs much larger than the diameter of its head. This snake has no teeth, but does have bony protrusions on the inside edge of its spine, which it uses to break shells when it eats eggs."
