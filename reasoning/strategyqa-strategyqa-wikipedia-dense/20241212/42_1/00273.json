As an example, the size and location of the restaurant would be up to 2 thousand people. Finally, we need to consider the area of the restaurant and restaurant in question, as it is situated in the city centre of Paris. The most accessible location for Viper Room is the main entrance hall. The SECRET Theater, which is located in the center of Paris, is available for use at the function hall. However, the location of the TIC Caf\u00e9, which is in the middle of the restaurant could be a key factor for judging the size of the restaurant.

Therefore, a concert may not be found at the National Diet building. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, Viper Room concert hypothetically could be held at the National Diet building. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what is meant by \"Viper Room. First, we need to understand that it is an intimate concert held at the Sentul International Convention Center (STC) in Jakarta, Indonesia, which is in Asia and a high-rise. Next, we need to consider the location of the venue. It is located in a public place. For example, a concert held at the Sentul International Convention Center has an seating area of 4,000 m2. This means that this venue can easily accommodate 1,000 people, if you are planning to be held at the STC's event hall in Jakarta. Since we can't accommodate all the seating and seated parties in a single venue, the performance venue is the National Diet building. Despite the fact that this venue is in Jakarta, it cannot accommodate all the seating and seated parties in the sand-filled venue as scheduled. Hence the correct answer to the question is \"no\" or \"yes\". Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what Viper Room was designed for. It is a contemporary style musical venue that is typically reserved for the modern audience.

However, the venue itself does not have the capacity to accommodate the number of people who attend each concert. Therefore, it is impossible for a Viper Room concert to be held at the National Diet building as it cannot accommodate each of the performers. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine what would constitute a Viper Room concert if it can be held at a convention centre.

Therefore, the relevant information is given below. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, Viper Room concert cannot possibly be held at a national diet building because it cannot accommodate large crowds in a venue like this. Answer: B"
