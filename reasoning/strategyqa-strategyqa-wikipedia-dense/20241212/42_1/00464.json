        "Firstly, we need to consider which animals are based on animal species. Leopard cats are not commonly found in Asia or Europe, but they do display a similar habitat structure to Bornean Orangutan species. The answer is (B) no, leopard cats are more likely in distress. They are known to be extremely aggressive, sometimes even attacking people and animals. It's also highly unlikely that humans would be too resourceful, especially when they have to resort to ruts and cliffs to make their living. Secondly, we can determine the exact distances between Leopards and Bornean Orangutan species. If we compare leopards with Bornean Orangutan animals, we're left with a set distance that is between 1.3 and 2.8 miles. Thus, Leopard cats are in smaller groups and cannot be compared with Bornean or Bornean Orangutan animals. Hence, leopard cats are considered to be a bit less likely. They may even come close to each other in an extreme confrontation or even clash. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "This question refers to a two-part question about straits or catching. Although the leopard is a large, oblong-headed species, it is more likely that the Bornean Orangutan is a species of orangutan, which means they may be able to land safely without causing damage to themselves. Thus, the answers to this question are (B) correct; while we might not know exactly what we're trying to answer (B) on a scale we cannot determine the exact position of Bornean orangutan. In general, it is a very common answer that leopards were very highly socialized and frequently raped at the same time and were known to have a greater degree of fear or fear than orangutan. However, the birth of orangutan to be a leopard or orangutan is an issue that can occur from a different perspective. Which is true for Bornean orangutans? Leopards are a species with a very limited risk meter range and relatively small territorial groups. Both cats cannot find themselves in the same situation, so the answer to the question is (B) no - leopard cats are not in less dire straits than Bornean Orangutan. Thus, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what straddling refers to. In straving from Africa to the West, it refers to the places where leopards or tigers live. Next, we need to establish whether Bornean or Bornean species are in better contact with humans. As a result, Bornean or Bornean orangutans primarily use leopards and Bornean orangutans, depending on where they live. They do not possess any threatening behaviors and tend to avoid humans. The population of Bornean orangutans contains an estimated 1,600 species of Leopard and Bornean Orangutan species. However, Bornean orangutans are also known for their dangerous interactions with humans. Therefore, it is likely that Bornean orangutans, as well as leopards, are in less severe straging than Bornean orangutans because leopards and Bornean orangutans are closely related species. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to establish the source of these cats\u2019 grazing. Leopard cats have a higher risk of straying and being struck by a tiger in South Asia. Next, we need to consider the size of Bornean Orangutan tigers in the southern continent, as well as other predators such as birds and leopards. Since Leopard cats are larger, they would likely be considered in greater numbers. Leopard cats are larger than bornean oranggutans and are less likely than Bornean oranggutans to be targeted as predators. These animals are extremely afraid of other wild animals like leopards and tigers, so that leopards may be at greater risk. As leopards are more susceptible to straits, so should they be drawn to more dangerous animals, or for those that are better suited for the situation. This scenario has been given many different names and has been a few different examples, but it is possible that leopard cats have differed from other leopard cats. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, leopard cats are not in more dire straits than Bornean Orangutans. Answer: B",
        "First, the first important point to consider is that if you don't know the name of the species or even have seen a leopard before, then you might not know the difference. The Orangutan is a small orphaned leopard that lives in a forest area in western Kenya. While the leopard is a rare animal that has been around for millions of years, the Orangutan has not yet had that chance of having been adopted by any tribe. Leopard cats are not considered an endangered species, and there is no information to suggest that or the fact that leopard cats are in more trouble with straying. The Orangutans are a small orphaned orangutan that has ate prey for generations, and this prevents them from having an interaction with human beings or other animals. However, the orangutan is not a significant threat to the leopards, and a leopard may not have any difficulty eating prey or food while in its natural habitat. Therefore, based on this information, it is possible that leopard cats and orangutans are in less serious straits than Borneans as they have been seen interacting with humans without warning. Instead, they may still have difficulties identifying humans or other predators. Answer: B"

        "Leopard attack . The frequency of leopard attacks on humans varies by geographical region and historical period. Despite the leopard's (\"Panthera pardus\") extensive range from sub-Saharan Africa to Southeast Asia, attacks are regularly reported only in India and Nepal. Among the five \"big cats\", leopards are less likely to become man-eaters\u2014only jaguars and snow leopards have a less fearsome reputation. However, leopards are established predators of non-human primates, sometimes preying on species as large as the western lowland gorilla. Other primates may make up 80% of the leopard's diet. While leopards generally avoid humans, they tolerate proximity to humans better than lions and tigers, and often come into conflict with humans when raiding livestock."
