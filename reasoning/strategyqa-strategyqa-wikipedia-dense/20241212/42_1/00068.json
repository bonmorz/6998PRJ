        "Firstly, a sesame seed is a seed. This is where a wood frog egg comes from. Next, we need to understand if a sesame seed is the same as a wood frog egg. This is because in humans, a single sesame seed is capable of producing multiple sesame eggs. The seeds are designed to store energy and protein, which are essential in order for a fruit to hatch properly. Next, we need to identify the condition of the tree where a tree is placed. The tree is typically covered in rocky hills, in addition to a dense layer of green materials that are used to protect its eggs from impact, including extreme cold weather conditions. Lastly, the tree's environment is in addition to nature. Because a tree is surrounded by different trees, it would likely be difficult for it to develop the seeds and its growth to occur. As a result, it would not be possible for any trees to produce a similar plant to one of the more common trees in the forest. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, a sesame seed would not be considered the same as a wood frog egg. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a sesame seed is. A sesame seed is a type of seed that is known to have protective lining that is meant to keep the seed in good condition during fertilization. In fact, a sesame seed is known for providing a protective barrier against bacteria that can increase the risk of fecal villi. Next, we need to consider the characteristics of a wood frog. Although the frog is known for its ability to live for over 24 hours due to the fact that it is constantly exposed to heat and moisture, its eggs typically contain small, black spots that can become painful or mushy, making them vulnerable to diseases and even infections. Also, the sesame seed should be a good choice for the test as it is a safe bet since a frog can withstand extreme temperatures and temperatures. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what is meant by \"miston\": a sunflower is a seed that is not normally grown on land or within the environment. Instead, we need to look at a pinewood seed. A pinewood seed is a seed that contains a semi-solid layer that provides support for the growth of a healthy, young, healthy plant. Next, we need to understand what wood frog eggs are. They are typically found in a location surrounded by cedar, huckster or oak trees. A sesame seed is a seed that is commonly used as a seed for breakfast. The adult frog emerges out of its cocoon of samurai and eats tree seeds or a tree sapling, which is a type of fruit used for making food. Thus, a red-legged frog would appear on a sesame seed with its own distinct set of colors and patterns. Additionally, wood frog eggs are common in areas that do not have any natural vegetation or animals. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, a sesame seed would not be mistaken for a wood frog egg. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand the characteristics of a frog egg. A frog egg is a globular tube shaped object in a single layer that consists of four parts. Next, we need to understand the differences in the appearance of a sesame seed and its characteristics for each species. A sesame seed is a unique crop, whereas a wood frog egg is unique and rare in its species. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, a sesame seed would not be mistaken for a wood frog egg. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who a wood frog egg is. This is a plant species whose reproduction is a whole of growth rather than a single egg. Next, we need to look at the characteristics of a sesame seed. One edible seed is typically a sesame seed. A sesame seed is usually a small seed with a rounded base, like a sunflower seed, which allows an egg to develop into a fully developed flesh-like body. Next, we need to identify the characteristics of a wood frog egg. There is no trace of eggs inside a sesame seed, so it cannot be considered a wood frog egg. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Frog . Frogs' embryos are typically surrounded by several layers of gelatinous material. When several eggs are clumped together, they are collectively known as frogspawn. The jelly provides support and protection while allowing the passage of oxygen, carbon dioxide and ammonia. It absorbs moisture and swells on contact with water. After fertilization, the innermost portion liquifies to allow free movement of the developing embryo. In certain species, such as the Northern red-legged frog (\"Rana aurora\") and the wood frog (\"Rana sylvatica\"), symbiotic unicellular green algae are present in the gelatinous material. It is thought that these may benefit the developing larvae by providing them with extra oxygen through photosynthesis. Most eggs are black or dark brown and this has the advantage of absorbing warmth from the sun which the insulating capsule retains. The interior of globular egg clusters of the wood frog (\"Rana sylvatica\") has been found to be up to 6\u00a0\u00b0C (11\u00a0\u00b0F) warmer than the surrounding water and this speeds up the development of the larvae."
