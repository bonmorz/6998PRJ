The scandal enumerated several major companies, including Subway, such as the San Juan Carrera, and included the deaths of two children who were sex offenders. Therefore, Pedophilia is known as a group of pedophobes and has existed since the 18th century, but when Subway was involved in a pedophilia scandal that it has previously handled the case, the question is not related to subway or the sub-S.Wingas Corporation, which is an oil industry that is involved in pedophilia.

        "Step 1. One of the important issues on mind is that Subway did not have a policy or any other policies in place. Step 2.

Subway's legal responsibility for the alleged sex offenders was a violation of state and federal laws. Step 4.

        "Pedophilia . Pedophilia was first formally recognized and named in the late 19th century. A significant amount of research in the area has taken place since the 1980s. Although mostly documented in men, there are also women who exhibit the disorder, and researchers assume available estimates underrepresent the true number of female pedophiles. No cure for pedophilia has been developed, but there are therapies that can reduce the incidence of a person committing child sexual abuse. The exact causes of pedophilia have not been conclusively established. Some studies of pedophilia in child sex offenders have correlated it with various neurological abnormalities and psychological pathologies. In the United States, following \"Kansas v. Hendricks\", sex offenders who are diagnosed with certain mental disorders, particularly pedophilia, can be subject to indefinite civil commitment."
