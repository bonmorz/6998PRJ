        "First, it is important to understand the role of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State is a senior position in the US government known as a stewardiate, a role of officials who manage government functions, and is the primary representative of the US government. Now, let's consider the role of an administrative assistant in an office. The secretary is usually responsible for the administration of government, especially if it is overseeing a specific department or office. This role may involve working on the same tasks and doing some sort of tasks such as writing a budget, preparing documents, or working in a department. While the secretary is assumed to be accountable and fair, it is assumed to be responsible and fair.
