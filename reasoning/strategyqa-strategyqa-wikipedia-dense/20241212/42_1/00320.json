        "First, we need to understand who Japan is. Japan is a country that has seen a dramatic increase in the incidence of breast cancer in the past 20 years. Next, we need to consider the history of breast cancer in Japan. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers of women in general, and it was estimated that 8 million cases in 1990 to be in the US. This means that while Japan is a predominantly male country, it was also estimated that around one million breast cancer cases grew and spread quickly. Thus, as the answer to this question comes in mind, it is unlikely that someone in Japan will survive a certain period of time. Therefore, in considering this information, we can conclude that Japan has a higher population of breast cancer patients than Sweden has. It is highly unlikely that someone in Japan had any higher rates of life compared to Japan or Sweden. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, not depending on the population of Japan. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know what breast cancer is. Breast cancer is an acute form of breast cancer that occurs in the breast, lining its sagging breast, and developing into neoplastic tissue in the lining of the breasts. Now, we need to understand what a patient's risk factor for breast cancer is. A person with female or male hormones, such as estrogen, proteinuria, or testosterone, is likely to survive a disease that causes a female hormone that will increase the risk of breast cancer for female women. If breast cancer is the primary treatment option, it is likely to lead to a lower risk of developing breast cancer, especially in women with no addictions to estrogen or testosterone. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, someone is more likely to survive having breast cancer in Japan than in Sweden. Answer: B",
        "First we need to identify if a patient can live better or worse in Japan. Secondly, based on previous history and research, it is likely that people in Japan have a better understanding of cancer and have less risk of it. Therefore, based on current health and personal health information about the person that is experiencing breast cancer, it is unlikely that they will be less likely to survive having breast cancer in Japan. However, based on these information, it is also possible that a patient might have a higher rate of survival and more specific to their specific symptoms, such as dyrrhophobia, lymphedema, and diarrhoea. Therefore, it is likely that one person in Japan would have a greater chance of survival than a patient in Sweden. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, someone in Japan is more likely to survive having breast cancer in Japan than in Sweden. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what breast cancer is. Breast cancer is a disease that has spread to the breast and sometimes to the surface of the breast, which is sometimes referred to as cell ovarian carcinoma. Next, we need to determine whether Japan or Sweden are more likely to have breast cancer. The answer is (B) no, the population of Japan is much less likely. The question is also asking whether someone in Sweden is less likely to have breast cancer. This means that if someone in Japan is a very healthy person, even if there is no cure for it, it is not as likely that they would have breast cancer. A further and further study is necessary to determine how much sex a person has or has to live with breast cancer. To confirm what we have heard, Japan is generally considered to be the safest country for a number of different diseases in terms of health. Japan's population is mostly considered to be safer, so we don't find it too easy or outright in the light of their situation. Overall, Japan is a nation that is a developed country, and the fact that Japan is a country that has made some waves in its medical sector in the past year has made it more likely to have breast cancer. Therefore, the answer is (B) yes, someone in Japan is more likely to have breast cancer than in Sweden. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define what breast cancer is. Breast cancer is a cancer that causes abnormal cells within the breast to develop abnormally. The way breast cancer grows and develops in the breast varies with how young a person is, and there are a few factors that influence survival. Breast cancer is most common in the genitals in men and women, so it is relatively riskier to live in these countries than in the rest of the world. The question is about the probability of survival in Japan, as breast cancer has more incidence in Japan in the past two years, whereas in Sweden, breast cancer has the most incidence in the same region. Finally, we need to think about the geographical location of Japan. Japan is also a country with a relatively low incidence of breast cancer, whereas in Sweden, there are few breast cancers in both the country and the United States. Therefore, it is more likely to be able to reach a level of disease survival in Japan than in Sweden. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, someone is more likely to have breast cancer in Japan than in Sweden, despite a lower level of risk of disease survival in Japan than in Sweden. Answer: B"

        "Breast cancer . Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin. Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, older age, prior history of breast cancer, and family history. About 5\u201310% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. In addition, there are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments it may respond to. The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review stated that it is unclear if mammographic screening does more good or harm. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years old. The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene may be used in an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventative measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with cancer, a number of treatments may be used, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and targeted therapy. Types of surgery vary from breast-conserving surgery to mastectomy. Breast reconstruction may take place at the time of surgery or at a later date. In those in whom the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, treatments are mostly aimed at improving quality of life and comfort. Outcomes for breast cancer vary depending on the cancer type, extent of disease, and person's age. Survival rates in the developed world are high, with between 80% and 90% of those in England and the United States alive for at least 5 years. In developing countries survival rates are poorer. Worldwide, breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in women, accounting for 25% of all cases. In 2012 it resulted in 1.68 million new cases and 522,000 deaths. It is more common in developed countries and is more than 100 times more common in women than in men."
