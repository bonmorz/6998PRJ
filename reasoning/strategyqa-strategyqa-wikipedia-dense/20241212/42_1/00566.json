        "First, we need to determine the percentage ownership of one Amazon share (A) is equal to the number of Amazon owned shares (M). Now, let's define the amount of Amazon shares that can be bought in a given amount to 20+ Amazon shares. There are many different ways that this is possible, but it's clear that this may not always be the case. In this case, there are a number of ways that Amazon could make subscriptions faster, so Amazon and Netflix could be the only two methods of getting this rate up. On the other hand, this means that Amazon would have more revenue than Netflix without any ads or fee payments. If Amazon bundled three things together together, Amazon could charge a total of $10,400 (over 250,000 dollars) on Netflix. This could lead to a loss of about $80,000/year to Amazon or even less than $120,000/month to Amazon. With Amazon and Netflix in both hands, we should be able to share the same perks, bringing the total cost of buying a quarter of an entire Amazon share over $20,000. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a subscription is. It is a subscription service and most people pay monthly, monthly, or annual subscription fees for the services. Next, we need to determine what kind of subscriptions are available to Netflix (PayTV, Netflix, TVP, streaming), Amazon, TVSuite, Amazon Video, and Amazon Instant. Since Amazon and Netflix are both online subscription services, it is common to think of each person as a customer or a business partner who manages their own business accounts. However, Amazon and Netflix share monopolies over the subscription markets, so one monopoly over each account might mean that one person only exists for subscription and not a lifetime subscription. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First of all, Amazon is the largest shopping website for a subscription service, which is a service that sells streaming content. Amazon is a marketplace for people that shop in select media stores, and it is a well-known subscription provider of movies and shows. Therefore, it is unlikely that a single Amazon share could buy a 20 year Netflix subscription. On the other hand, a single Amazon share can provide a much higher volume of content for an Amazon video subscription. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define the size of a person's shared subscription to the subscription service. The average value of a subscription service is 30 minutes, and this is equivalent to 30 hours for each individual user. We can think of only 5 or so users, each for 30 minutes, and this amounts to 5 to 10 hours. Next, we need to determine how much time each person may be spending without buying anything, or if they are spending any amount. It is easy to determine the monthly amount a person is using by asking them if they want to pay. On the other hand, if one person is using Netflix or TV as the option, if they can afford only 1 more hour of free time, the average monthly price is $10. These are price tickets, which is a small fee. This is a relatively small amount, and thus it is unlikely that one person would purchase a subscription to Netflix and not plan on using it. Thus, the answer to the question is (B) no, the subscription option is not available and can be done by an individual. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a 20-year Netflix subscription is and what a 20 year subscription means. Amazon\u2019s current product, Kindle Fire, is a monthly subscription service that is currently available. We then need to nudge Amazon\u2019s current product to determine if a price match represents a valid price. Therefore, we can only give up to 100 copies of Kindle Fire instead of 100 copies of a Kindle Fire to buy a twenty-year Netflix subscription. Since there are no specific Amazon shares and no specific Amazon Share number, it is impossible for us to conclude that Amazon shares alone can buy a twenty-year Netflix subscription because Amazon stands alone. Therefore, the answer to the question (A) is (B) yes, if one Amazon share could ever buy a twenty-year Netflix subscription, it would make sense to compare the number of Amazon share sales as a single v. A purchase in the range of 100 to the number of Kindle Fire users. Answer: B"

        "Video on demand . Subscription VOD (SVOD) services use a subscription business model, where subscribers are charged a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly fee to access unlimited programs. These services include Now TV, Netflix, Amazon Video, TVPlayer, Hulu Plus. SVOD services have drawn a lot of attention for their role in films. As of June 2017, Netflix is expected to add nearly 40 original movies to its platform. Hulu has invested its time in creating documentaries for its platform, while Amazon has acquired films from notable producers such as Spike Lee. Because of the large following SVOD services have, Netflix made an appearance at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival in France. Many took offense to this, stating that movies not presented in theaters should be omitted from qualifying from winning the Palme d'Or prize. SVOD services can be seen as highly successful, and will continue to grow their audience for it being \"a production house, broadcaster, recommendation and hosting service, and pseudo-DVD rental store.\""
