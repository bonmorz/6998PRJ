        "Step 1: On the surface, there is a story to back up this claim. Step 2: Kane's Royal Rumble record started in 1995 and was a feud between two wrestlers. Step 3: On the verge of a career as a professional wrestler, there is evidence that a recent player (Klam) Brown took his reputation by storm. Step 3: So he must have outlasted the previous match which he attempted to do, and the result of the match was that he couldn't continue the fight without a win. Step 4: Based on the Royal Rumble records, there are no documented evidence of violence or violence at this time. Also, it is impossible to figure out who murdered or disappeared at all, the odds and methods of the two competitors, and a potential suspect to the death stage of the match. Step 5: Is there any evidence to validate these claims, to give a plausible defense or any possible evidence for the theory of killing? There is no evidence of a rash or case of murder on Kane's part, or any of his victims. However, there are numerous other evidence to support the claims that Kane may have murdered more than once in the process. In fact, the story of the Royal Rumble started in the early 2000s and culminated into a feud between Brock and Randy Orton, a professional wrestler who has been in numerous feuds and murders since his days in WWE. Thus, the answer to the question, who have any evidence to prove this is the case, and who can have any evidence to substantiate this claim? Answer: B",
        "Is it true that Kane's Royal Rumble match has a total attendance of 7,000? That's right, more than any other death-core match, and even more incredibly violent, in fact. This means that the entire Rumble story has been seen differently. The first thing that we need to look at is the average attendance for the match, e.g., 9000. However, even with that, it's not likely that everyone has any knowledge of Kane's own Royal Rumble record. He may have not fought in the Rumble during his career and was probably not the first man to be eliminated by death in the series. So, how does this result in record records? The Royal Rumble is a match between wrestlers and competitors that is contested. The most important thing is the number of competitors who were eliminated in the match. As this is the standard match, there are four wrestlers who have fought at the Rumble, and a number of wrestlers who have defeated or eliminated other wrestlers in the Rumble. If you are familiar with the Royal Rumble match, it's important to know that people who have died are not those who have played in the Royal Rumble, or the Royal Rumble itself. You may not know this number, but it's easier to look in the context of the match than the question. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to determine the history of Kane's Royal Rumble match. Kane's Royal Rumble match is a pay-per-show match, where wrestlers are eliminated using a combination of wrestling techniques, eliminations, and an electrostatic table-top that bounces from a sleeping prone opponent. The Royal Rumble refers to a series of 15 rounds that are played in a rousing, frantic game where each man wins with a different opponent with each match taking on his own individual characteristics. These were some of the first fights Kane wrestled in that year, which was in January 2016. However, because they were a traditional match with an ensuing number that required them to have a few moments before the competitor took the last spot. Kane's Royal Rumble match also involves a lengthy circuit involving a team of wrestlers who will then move their team to the end of the match. Ultimately, these two wrestlers are each eliminated, which means that they may or may not have a chance to win the match in the ring. If the match is in a rousing race, it is a different outcome for each wrestler, hence the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "1. We're asking if any murderers have survived the Royal Rumble match. 2. According to legend, Kane's Royal Rumble has ended at least one year after the event. 3. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes, there are some murderers who have survived the Rumble. However, based on Kane's reign as a fighter, it is possible that he could have been executed a long time after he's been on the Rumble. 4. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, Kane's Royal Rumble has concluded. 5. However, it is possible that a fight can resume before the Rumble is concluded, which can then result in the start of a new match between the wrestlers. 6. Regardless of the result, Kane's Royal Rumble is likely to go on after a season that started sometime in the year before the event. 7. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, any murderer who has suffered a lengthy reign of the Royal Rumble is likely to have outlived Kane's Royal Rumble record. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand Kane's Royal Rumble match, which occurred on January 30th 1886 (the first day of the Royal Rumble) and essentially ended on January 30th 1884, was held on January 29th 1887 (which is the week of the Rumble) due to the incident of John Cena. Next, we need to consider the Royal Rumble match. This is a professional wrestling match for wrestlers who are able to compete and defeat a numbered variety of characters in the top-billed match ring. This event is often renamed to \"Battle Royal\" after the series of events that began in 1888 and culminated in the reign of King Cena. Since this is a wrestling match that usually takes place between the top-30 wrestlers, there is no doubt that any murderers have used the Royal Rumble during their respective careers. It's important that we understand what killed those wrestlers as they battled for them as they waged war on the thrones in the aftermath of their match, as these were those who had not wrestled in the past. However, if this is true and it means that it was Kane's royal Rumble of 1884 then, in contrast with his current record, there are some reasonable indications of his legacy to be the most popular. Therefore, the answer to the question is : (A) yes, the number of murderers (or \"the average) in Kane's Royal Rumble has outstopped that era. Answer: B"

        "Royal Rumble match . The Royal Rumble match is a professional wrestling match based on the classic Battle Royal match, in which a number of wrestlers (traditionally 30) aim at eliminating their competitors by tossing them over the top rope, with both feet touching the floor. The match is typically the main event of WWE's January pay-per-view known as the Royal Rumble. The winner of the event is the last wrestler remaining after all others have been eliminated. According to Hornswoggle, who worked for WWE from 2006 until 2016 and participated in three Rumbles, participants may learn their eliminations by knowing the two wrestlers who are eliminated before them and which wrestlers are entering the Royal Rumble before and after their elimination. According to CM Punk, who worked for WWE from 2005 until 2014, wrestler are given a list of entry numbers and eliminations and are supposed to build from there. The Royal Rumble differs from the classical Battle Royal as the contestants do not enter the ring at the same time, but instead are assigned entry numbers, usually via a lottery, although desirable spots are occasionally assigned by other means, the most common being winning a match. The match begins with the two wrestlers who have drawn entry numbers one and two, with the remaining wrestlers entering the ring at regular timed intervals, either 90 seconds or two minutes, according to their entry number. This format is credited to Pat Patterson. To date, only four men who have been one of the starting wrestlers have won the Royal Rumble: Shawn Michaels in 1995, Vince McMahon in 1999, Chris Benoit in 2004, and Rey Mysterio in 2006 while only three men who have been the final entrant won the Royal Rumble: The Undertaker in 2007, John Cena in 2008 and Triple H in 2016. The most common number to win is number 27."
