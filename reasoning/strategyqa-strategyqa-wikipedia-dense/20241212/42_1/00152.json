        "First, we need to understand what rabies is. Rabies is a common viral infection that causes fever, headaches, nausea, and vomiting. Second, we need to understand how Snoopy transmits the virus. To do so, they need to be able to transmit rabies without exposure to the host. This requires a veterinarian to obtain additional medical care. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, Snoopy could transmit rabies. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what Snoopy is. Snoopy is a dog that is known for laying between different ground objects. Secondly, we can look at Svington's family. Snoopy's dad is a veterinarian who is highly-accused of dogs, as he is prone to transmit rabies from various animals that are exposed to it. Third, we can read about his use of saliva from Snoopy's mom's spits. This is commonly believed to be the source of rabies in the human papil-pan lining of their mouth. Lastly, we need to check whether Snoopy would transmit the disease rabies via saliva or saliva--equivence, or zoose or saliva from snoopy's mama's mouth. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what Snoopy is. It is a breed of dog that is a dog breed known for its sensitivity to physical and dexterity. Now, this information is essential to the correct answer. Snoopy is a dog that is known for its aggressive behavior and aggression towards other dogs. On the other hand, it is known for its slur-like behavior and aggression toward humans. When someone bites or bites an infected animal, Snoopy is most likely to do infecting the animal in a rash, which can result in a fatal rabies case or a severe shivering. Therefore, Snoopy cannot transmit rabies or otherwise transmit it to humans. However, if Snoopy bites someone, or is infected with rabies, then it is possible that rabies could be transmitted. Therefore, the answer to this is (B) no, Snoopy could not transmit rabies. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine what Snoopy is. Snoopy is a white dabby who lives in Hong Kong, and there is no scientific evidence to support this idea. Now, we need to check for any risky contact with any dogs or people that have rabies symptoms. During the course of a rabies infection, all animals that have rabies will be able to transmit the disease. Therefore, the right answer is (B) - Yes, Snoopy could transmit rabies. Answer: B",
        "First, Snoopy is a dog known for its ability to sniff and snatch food and air. Next, we need to consider the possibility of Snoopy transmitting rabies. Snoopy is an aggressive or aggressive breed of dog known for its ability to sniff and snatch food, air, and water. Now, we need to consider the amount of time it took to detect and transmit Snoopy's symptoms. In a case like Snoopy, it typically took anywhere from 45 minutes to 24 hours after being bitten. This time has changed dramatically since Snoopy's initial release and was not repeated pending any clinical signs of the rabies disease. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Rabies . Rabies is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in humans and other mammals. Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure. These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms: violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness. Once symptoms appear, the result is nearly always death. The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months; however, this time period can vary from less than one week to more than one year. The time is dependent on the distance the virus must travel along nerves to reach the central nervous system. Rabies is caused by \"lyssaviruses\", including the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus. Rabies is spread when an infected animal scratches or bites another animal or human. Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact with the eyes, mouth, or nose. Globally, dogs are the most common animal involved. More than 99% of rabies cases in countries where dogs commonly have the disease are caused by dog bites. In the Americas, bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans, and less than 5% of cases are from dogs. Rodents are very rarely infected with rabies. The rabies virus travels to the brain by following the peripheral nerves. The disease can only be diagnosed after the start of symptoms. Animal control and vaccination programs have decreased the risk of rabies from dogs in a number of regions of the world. Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those who are at high risk. The high-risk group includes people who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common. In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms. Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water, povidone iodine, or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission. Only six people have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms, and this was with extensive treatment known as the Milwaukee protocol. Rabies caused about 17,400 deaths worldwide in 2015. More than 95% of human deaths caused by rabies occur in Africa and Asia. About 40% of deaths occur in children under the age of 15. Rabies is present in more than 150 countries and on all continents but Antarctica. More than 3 billion people live in regions of the world where rabies occurs. A number of countries, including Australia and Japan, as well as much of Western Europe, do not have rabies among dogs. Many small island nations do not have rabies at all. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease."
