        "First, we need to understand what argon is and is the main element of the periodic table of elements. Argon is a uranium element, which is found in the solar system which orbits the Earth. Next, we need to identify what's on the periodic table of elements. Argon is a metal element which is of special significance to celestial stars like Pluto and Saturn. Next, we need to look at the atomic weights of the two main elements - Argon and Neon. Argon is a uranus element, which is found in the space around Jupiter. Mercury, Saturn, and Pluto are all known to have a common atomic number of 268-235 (25.4) in the elementa argon. It is much stronger than the uranium element, which is equivalent to a total weight of 2.287 (24.8). So, the correct answer is (A) yes, Argon is near Neon on the periodic table of elements. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to establish the order in which elements are described. According to the periodic table of elements, it is possible for Argon to be near Neon because Neon is a celestial star, the star referred to as \"the moon\". Secondly, we need to know the order of elements. Based on our previous research on earth, there is evidence that Argon is near Neon. Therefore, it is possible for argon to be near Neon because of its atomic weight, or so-called \"neon\" - a single element that has a metal density of .657 millimeters (80%), has a phctal coefficient of .861 - 88, and is found atlas in a crate orbital orbit that is associated with a number of other celestial objects. Furthermore, it is possible for Neon to be near Argon if there are three other metal elements in the same number. Hence, we cannot assume that Argon and Neon are related in any way. However, since each element is of a different weight and is the result of being either a different element, it is possible that Argon may be closer to Neon in its atomic weight than Neon. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is \"yes\", and we will be able to answer it on this basis. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand the properties of Argon on the periodic table of elements. Argon is a chemical element that comes under helium metals. The other elements on the periodic table are iron, which can be defined by their average albedor of carbon and uranium (a combination of carbon and uranium). Similarly, Neon is a chemical element that can contain uranium, radium, oxygen and nitrogen. Lastly, we need to know the atomic weight of Argon. The atomic weight is determined by the number and degrees of both the element (earth is a common element), which has a maximum atomic weight of 39,940, while Neon is a minor element with a maximum atomic weight of 39,940. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) yes. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to establish a general understanding of the periodic table. The periodic table is a table of elements, which is known to contain the atomic weight of a particular element. These elements are called the atomic, or average weight, and are related to the average temperature, the length of a solid, or average temperature. Next, we need to determine if Argon and Neon are on the periodic table of elements. Argon is a mineral that has a basic role in the periodic table and is located in the outer axis of Earth. According to the periodic table, Argon is the most common element on the periodic table. If not, Argon is the most popular element. It is a common element in the atomic hierarchy of the celestial planets, including Saturn, Pluto, Saturn, and Saturn. Therefore, in order for Argon to be on the periodic table, it would require additional weights. Therefore, it should be determined whether Argon is near Neon on the periodic table. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to establish the orbital radius and the size of the element. When we consider the periodic table, the number of element argon is about 9600. Second, we need to calculate the position of Argon relative to Neon. Argon is a member of the element, and is a helical element. Now, we are considering whether or not the Argon has the same atomic position as the element (also, Argon can be seen as a non-radical element). Next, we need to consider the length of the element (which occurs on Earth due to high temperature) and the atomic weight of the element. We can see that Argon has a shorter orbital radius of 9600 times that Neon, as well as the length of the element. Therefore, we can conclude that Argon is not near Neon on the periodic table. According to the planet's periodic table, Argon is closer to a Jupiter, which means it does not have a much longer radius than Neon. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, Argon is near Neon.

        "Standard atomic weight . An example of why \u201cconventional terrestrial sources\" must be specified in giving standard atomic weight values is the element argon. Between locations in the Solar System, the atomic weight of argon varies as much as 10%, due to extreme variance in isotopic composition. Where the major source of argon is the decay of in rocks, will be the dominant isotope. Such locations include the planets Mercury and Mars, and the moon Titan. On Earth the ratios of the three isotopes Ar\u00a0:\u00a0Ar\u00a0:\u00a0Ar are approximately 5\u00a0:\u00a01\u00a0:\u00a01600, giving terrestrial argon a standard atomic weight of 39.948(1). This atomic weight is larger than that of the next element potassium, causing confusion in the days when the places of elements in the periodic table was largely determined according to atomic weight."
