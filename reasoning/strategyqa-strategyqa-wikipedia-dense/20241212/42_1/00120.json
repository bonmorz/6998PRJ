        "First, we need to know who Kane (wrestler) is. Kane is a wrestler who represents the WCW Championship wrestling brand. Next, we need to understand why the WCW Headquarters has been banned from WCW headquarters city. After a series of high-profile feuds, Kane did not make a comeback on the WCW's high-profile tag team. As a result, Kane ended his career as an employee on the WCW. Finally, we need to understand what WCW headquarters city was like if Kane was not banned from the WCW. WCW headquarters is headquartered in downtown Los Angeles. Thus, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "Two things that make the answer (B) out of this common knowledge are that Kane (WCW) was an English wrestler who appeared in the WCW franchise and competed in the WWE MMA series. There is no evidence to suggest any affiliation of Kane in the WWE or MMA franchise, and it can be concluded that the information is not accurate or has been shared in any way. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, the sentence describes Kane (wrestler) banned by WCW headquarters city, meaning that he is an active wrestler and wrestler known for his professional wrestling career. Kane was a heavyweight wrestler during a professional wrestling season, and he regularly participated in the DWP wrestling tournament. Now, let's take context from the point of view: if Kane was banned from WCW headquarters city, he could not have wrestled professionally. But, based on information and interviews associated with Kane, the answer to this question is probably yes. One possible explanation for Kane's behavior is that he tried to compete in a DWP show, which is a yearly tournament. The reason why Kane could not win in a WCW wrestling tournament in 1999 was due to Kane's participation in a World Heavyweight Championship and his dedication to wrestling. Furthermore, Kane had no other wrestling experience and is not considered a wrestler. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who Kane (wrestler) is. Kane, a wrestler, was a wrestler who competed with Hogan in the WCW Heavyweight Championship (1999\u20131992). Afterwards, he was arrested in New York State for attempted murder in September 2013 to gain a license to wrestle there. So, we can conclude that Kane was not criminalized or banned from WCW headquarters city. That is, Koos (also known as \"Mens in WCW\") is known to have been a wrestler who starred in television shows during his career. Instead, Kane was a stand-up comedian, who became known for stealing money from wrestlers with no remorse and believing in money to make more money. Additionally, Kane could have been convicted of crimes in Washington D.C. or any other specific area of violation, and could have been indicted in any area of violation. Therefore, based on the information given, it is possible that Kane's past involvement with WCW headquarters city was a resenator of police corruption or recrimination against him. Answer: A",
        "First of all, we need to understand the meaning of banned from WCW headquarters in the United Kingdom. A WCW headquarters is a large, multi-site, independent city, which means there are no restrictions or restrictions on wrestling on that location or the streets, while a wrestling stadium is the equivalent of a facility where most wrestlers work. However, there is no law or regulation against this type of activity. Kane (wrestler) was inducted into wrestling arenas in England by the WCW and is often considered one of the best in wrestling history. Therefore, it is safe to say that Kane did not have this restriction as a sanction, being banned in America from WCW headquarters. The answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A"
