        "First, we need to understand what noise is in nature. Unbearably high frequency noise is usually seen on telescopes that can hear or see long wavelengths. Next, we need to understand what noise is. Noise is an element found in space, and it can cause damage or discomfort in people's eyes. These factors have a significant impact on the ability or ability of a spacecraft to perform a specific mission, such as a spacecraft mission. In terms of radiation, radiation can negatively affect the organism's hearing ability. Therefore, if the radiation wavelength is low, they may become overly sensitive to sound or other electromagnetic sources. Therefore, it is safe to assume that a telescope can also be used to hear noise, but it is not usually safe to do this. Therefore, our answer to the question is (A) no. It is a mistake to assume that telescopes can hear or see not much radiation. Answer: A",
        "A telescope is a device that has a specialized optical equipment that is intended to collect vibrations and vibrations. An instrument is a telescope that has a special optical device that detects sound, and it detects vibrations in the air, vibrations, and temperature of the air. For example, a telescope is called a Kuber telescope that can collect vibrations and vibrations of the air, and can also make sound if there is a high frequency sound or vibration. Now, there is no sound coming from the telescope or anything else, bringing the question to a close. Thus, the correct answer is (B) no, telescopes cannot hear noise. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what noise is. There are radio waves that come in electromagnetic waves in waves. Next, we need to understand what a telescope is. Telescopes are used in space exploration to see stars with their own light. They also use telemetry in general. Next, we need to understand what is considered noise. Essentially, a telescope is an object that has energy, potential, or power available to detect signals and messages. They are equipped with GPS-like technology that is capable of receiving information about a location or planet. The potential power or information can be gathered and used in a way that is recognizable to its user base. Additionally, a telescope can provide insight and information about planetary orbits that could be gained by measuring the radiation levels of certain celestial bodies. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, telescopes cannot hear sound, and they are not capable of detecting sound at all. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand why telescopes are used for such purposes. They are not typically used to observe distant objects or find objects with a magnetic field. Next, we need to explore the possible properties of noise. This information is likely available from the scientific model used to analyze the matter, so our objective is to determine the likely source of the noise. Once we understand the source of the noise, it is safe to say that telescopes are not capable of hearing and decoding that information. However, it is important to note that not all electronic equipment works and is not limited to the electronic industry, which affects electronics products such as radio telescopes. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no. As such, telescopes are not considered appropriate to study the phenomenon. Since telescopes can only study objects, it is unlikely that they can hear any noise coming from them, so it is unlikely that they could detect or hear any noise from them. This is due to the fact that most objects on telescopes are also unusable or damaged by electrical failures or defects or defective technology. Therefore, it is unlikely that telescopes would hear any noise or damage from such a device as the microwave. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what telescopes are. Telescopes are cameras that record and record visual and ore movements from a distance, often allowing users to see through small objects like photos or images. In general, telescopes have a wider range of views than other cameras and instruments, providing them with a wider field of view. Therefore, it is important to note that although telescopes can sound, it is difficult to tell they are hearing or see motion. While they cannot be seen from afar, they can detect the noise they are absorbing, causing significant alterations to the noise and the surrounding environment, making them very difficult to hear. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) no, telescopes have no the ability to hear noise. Answer: A"

        "Noise (radio) . Thermal noise can be made lower by cooling the circuits, but this is only usually worthwhile on radio telescopes. In other applications the limiting noise source depends on the frequency range in use. At low frequencies (longwave or mediumwave) and at high frequencies (shortwave), interference caused by lightning or by nearby electrical impulses in electrical switches, motors, vehicle ignition circuits, computers, and other man-made sources tends to swamp transmissions with thermal noise. These noises are often referred to as static. Atmospheric noise is radio noise caused by natural atmospheric processes, primarily lightning discharges in thunderstorms. At very high frequency and ultra high frequency these sources can still be important, but at a much lower level, such that thermal noise is usually the limiting factor. Cosmic background noise is experienced at frequencies above about 15\u00a0MHz when highly directional antennas are pointed toward the sun or to certain other regions of the sky such as the center of the Milky Way Galaxy."
