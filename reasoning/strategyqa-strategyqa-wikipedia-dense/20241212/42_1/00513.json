        "Firstly, a Porsche 992 Turbo S can travel up to 285 mph. If we compare the speed of Usain Bolt and the speed of the modern Porsche, we can estimate that the two athletes would have a combined speed of 155 mph (-800 mph) on average. Using our current data, it should not surprise us that a Porsche 992 Turbo S would reach a speed of 73 mph (-600 mph) on average. However, a speed of 155 mph (-600 mph) would increase the force of the Porsche to potentially take away US sports champion Usain Bolt's speed in a sprint. Moreover, the Porsche has a much faster engine and faster gearbox than Usain Bolt. Furthermore, the 200 meters sprint speed would make it almost impossible for a Porsche 992 Turbo S to pass Usain Bolt in a sprint of the equivalent speed. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a Porsche 992 Turbo S would beat Usain Bolt in a sprint of the equivalent speed. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to measure the speed of a Porsche 992 Turbo S with its race distance. In an erection, a Porsche 992 Turbo S has a maximum speed of 400 mps. Next, we need to measure the speed of Usain Bolt's fastest time of a sprint, which is 37.58 km/h (23.35 mph). Given the speed difference, the speed of a Porsche 992 Turbo S is only 14.08 km/h (6.35 mph). So, for a 100 meter sprint, the fastest acceleration range is 58.8 km/h. This is the faster and higher speed of Usain Bolt. Therefore, the maximum speed at a sporting event of 98 metres is equivalent to less than 320 mps. Thus, a Porsche 992 Turbo S could be capable of completing the 100 meter sprint by a factor of 4 as long as it could go, and it would not be capable of competing at this speed. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who Usain Bolt is. Usain Bolt is an artist and writer whose work has been displayed over and over again in the past decades. Next, we need to compare the speed of a Porsche 992 Turbo S to the speed of a human. The Porsche 992 Turbo S is a Porsche 992 Turbo S that is not made to compete in the 100-meter Sprint Sprint Race. Rather, the speed of a human's speed is so slow that it cannot compete at all. Essentially, a Porsche 992 Turbo S does not have the power or endurance needed for competing at 200 meters per second. Essentially, an equestrian would have to complete a 90-meter (400 meters) lap in a 100 meter sprint and then run a 100 meter sprint. Therefore, if a Porsche 992 Turbo S wins the sprint, the answer is (B) no, they could not be the same as Usain Bolt. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine if a Porsche 992 Turbo S could compete in a 100 meter sprint. In a 100 meters sprint, a Porsche has a maximum speed of 333 mph or 1.619 kph, which is over 66 mph. Next, we need to find the speed of a Porsche 911 Turbo S. We believe that a 911 Turbo S could accelerate to 63 kph. Next, we need to determine the distance between two 100 meters. A 911 Turbo S is 339 meters long and weighs 150 kph, with a maximum speed of 63 kph or 1.619 kph. Next, we need to determine the speed of a Porsche 911 Turbo S. This is based on the speed and accuracy of a Porsche 911 Turbo S. We do not know if a Porsche 992 Turbo S could exceed Usain Bolt's maximum speed in a 100 meter sprint. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a Porsche 992 Turbo S could compete in a 100 meter sprint as it is a car with a high speed. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what \"perfect speed\" is. An average speed of 1.075 miles per hour is 302 mph. Next, we need to determine if a Porsche 992 Turbo S could compete in a 100 meter sprint. While speeds up and down in speed sports, there is an approximate acceleration between these two speeds. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Footspeed . The record was 44.72\u00a0km/h (27.8\u00a0mph), seen during the final 100 meters sprint of the World Championships in Berlin on 16 August 2009 by Usain Bolt. (Bolt's \"average\" speed over the course of this race was 37.58 km/h or 23.35 mph.) Maximum human sprint speed is strikingly slower than that of many animals. Compared to other land animals, humans are exceptionally capable of endurance, but incapable of great speed. For example, cheetahs can attain short bursts of speed well over 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph), the American quarter horse has topped 88\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph), greyhounds can reach 70\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph), and the Mongolian wild ass has been measured at 64\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph). Even the domestic cat may reach 48\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph)."
