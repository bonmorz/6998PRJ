        "First, we need to understand who Benjamin Franklin is. Benjamin Franklin was a British artist, the author of a series of books including \"An A Beautiful Story\" (1879). In his books, his writings, and his music, including some of the earliest and most original works, notably his song \"The Red River\", the opening, and the song \"Aneas, All-American.\" He was known as a sculptor, and was one of the most beloved artists of his generation. We can also consider the context in which Benjamin Franklin was based. His sculptures are mostly depicting portraits of men, women, and children whose rights were not recognized. In those depictions, the black lifes of certain men and women in blackface were depicted with statues of women, women, and children. It is important for the art of modernization to be considered a form of resistance, or resistance against oppression. Therefore, we can say that Benjamin Franklin is an advocate for black life and freedom through Black Lives Matter movement (BBM) movements. It is not clear that slavery was the primary cause of his sculptures in the period of time, and it is not clear whether he was a candidate for the \"prime\" clause in the BBM. Therefore, the answer to the question is no, Benjamin Franklin is not a prime candidate to have his statues removed by Black Lives Matter movement. Thus the answer to the question is (B) no, Benjamin Franklin is not a candidate to have his statues removed by the Black Lives Matter movement. Answer: B",

So, Benjamin Franklin is a prominent advocate for human rights and democracy. He was the first person to create discrimination in American society by protesting oppression. Now, let's consider the problem with Benjamin Franklin's statues. As we said earlier, according to Brown in News, it's a piece of myth that was created to help the public and people feel as they could use his life as a witness and inspiration to others. The statues are often exhibited in public places or in parks. If we look at the statues, they are often depicted by black people. However, there are plenty of images online that display Benjamin Franklin as a leader in black struggle for human rights and democracy. He also maintains a positive image that black people can achieve through their participation in anti-violence. There are many examples of black people rallying against the black dead and pursuing their own civil rights and causes. In fact, there are several sources of information that support these demonstrations. Firstly, we need to establish who Benjamin Franklin is. He is a noted black artist who lives and works on the streets in New York, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. Secondly, we need to establish who Thomas Jefferson was. Thomas Jefferson is the leader of the Black Lives Matter movement. He's a prominent abolitionist who views black people as the only non-violent people in the world. This leader is prominently known for his anti-violence actions, which are depicted in various national and international newspapers. Therefore, Benjamin Franklin's presence as a leader in Black Lives Matter has been highlighted and confirmed to some extent by some sources in Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and Washington D.C., all of whom advocated for a different black people's right to express their political views and practices. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",

        "Oppression . Resistance to oppression has been linked to a moral obligation, an act deemed necessary for the preservation of self and society. Still, resistance to oppression has been largely overlooked in terms of the amount of research and number of studies completed on the topic, and therefore, is often largely misinterpreted as \"lawlessness, belligerence, envy, or laziness\". Over the last two centuries, resistance movements have risen that specifically aim to oppose, analyze, and counter various types of oppression, as well as to increase public awareness and support of groups marginalized and disadvantaged by systematic oppression. Late 20th century resistance movements such as liberation theology and anarchism set the stage for mass critiques of, and resistance to, forms of social and institutionalized oppression that have been subtly enforced and reinforced over time. Resistance movements of the 21st century have furthered the missions of activists across the world, and movements such as liberalism, Black Lives Matter (related: Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter) and feminism (related: Meninism) are some of the most prominent examples of resistance to oppression today."
