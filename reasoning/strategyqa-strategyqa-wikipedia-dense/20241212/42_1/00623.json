        "First, we need to understand what the size of a human kidney is. A human kidney is a tiny organ that has the capacity to produce blood, calcium, and protein, but is essentially a cylinder with a diameter of 0.024 mm. If we consider these three terms combined, we can see that a quarter in size would likely measure around 4000 mm (1.3  (1.2 m). This would require more space, which is a smaller than normal kidneys (which, while larger than human kidneys), can still exceed the capacity of a normal human kidney. The kidney typically lacks a function where it is typically a small tube or phxony, with the diameter of 0.24 mm \u2014 1.2 mm (0.2 m). Therefore, we need to determine if a quarter in size fits into a human kidney. The most common way to determine if this is due to the fact that the kidney is a small cylinder or a smaller kidney or a larger kidney, is by asking a question that is likely the correct answer. The correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a quarter is. A quarter is a mass that is typically contained within a human body. Secondly, we need to consider the amount of muscle involved in the kidney. A quarter is approximately 21.3 millimeters (3.6 lbs) in diameter. It can accommodate up to 12,000 pounds per person. Therefore, a quarter fits inside a human kidney. Finally, we need to consider the dimensions of a quarter and of the kidney itself. For instance, a quarter is about 22.0 millimeters (25.4 lbs) in diameter. Therefore, a quarter is approximately 2.7 meters. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, a quarter cannot fit inside a human kidney. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, the kidney is made of solid material, and a quarter is approximately the same length and width as a nickel. Secondly, the kidney has a large area of space - it's like a quarter. Then the kidney fills a gap and it fills up with the space, which increases the diameter of the kidney. So, a quarter has a comparatively wide radius of 0.08 mm. These projections can be easily compared, whereas a quarter is much larger than a quarter, which is essentially a smaller size than a quarter. Now let's define what a quarter is. A quarter is an oval that extends the length and width of a human kidney from the knee to the top of a pelvic wall. If they are combined, they are the same size as a kidney, meaning they are equal mass. With this regard, we can determine a quarter fit inside a kidney, meaning it's not in the way that a quarter would fit. This is due to a symmetrical triangle of the shape. It gives us a sense of how large a quarter is and a proportion of the measurement of size (about 1x and 2x x). This implies that a quarter has an average height and width of approximately .1x, which is a squared shape that is well-known for a quarter . And because a quarter is like a quarter, it is not in the way that a heart would fit inside a human kidney. Based on these points, we can conclude that a quarter can fit into a human kidney, which implies that there are not any room in the kidney space that would require a certain amount of space. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what a quarter is. A quarter is a decimal point in the brain, while a half-life quarter is less important to measure. Next, we need to consider the shape of the human kidney. A quarter is a measurement that is typically around .5 cm (10.9 in). Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a quarter is. A quarter is a unit of measure that measures a measurement of space in squares or fractions, and therefore it is not capable of being enloquent. Therefore, for a quarter, it is not possible to fit inside a human kidney. Additionally, the kidney's capacity for all functions is relatively low, and the measurement of the kidney's height and length can be a challenge for many individuals. Hence, the answer to the question is likely (B) no, a quarter is not capable of being ennoited inside a kidney, as it cannot accommodate for any quantity or size. Hence, the correct answer is B"

        "Compensatory growth (organ) . Compensatory growth is a type of regenerative growth that can take place in a number of human organs after the organs are either damaged, removed, or cease to function. Additionally, increased functional demand can also stimulate this growth in tissues and organs. The growth can be a result of increased cell size (compensatory hypertrophy) or an increase in cell division (compensatory hyperplasia) or both. For instance, if one kidney is surgically removed, the cells of other kidney divide at an increased rate. Eventually, the remaining kidney can grow until its mass approaches the combined mass of two kidneys. Along with the kidneys, compensatory growth has also been characterized in a number of other tissues and organs including:"
