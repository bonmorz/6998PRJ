        "Sirius in fiction . Sirius AB is the alpha star of the constellation Canis Major (the great dog, sometimes styled as Orion's hunting dog), whence its cognomen \"the dog star\". The most commonly used proper name of this star comes through the Latin \"Sirius\", from the Greek \u03a3\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (\"Seirios\", \"glowing\" or \"scorcher\"). The ancient Greeks observed that the appearance of Sirius heralded the hot and dry \"dog days\" of summer, and feared that it caused plants to wilt, men to weaken, and women to become aroused. (see \"The Iliad\" below). The star was also an important harbinger of winter to Maori and Polynesian cultures, and central to the animist beliefs of the Dogon people of Mali. To this day it is frequently mentioned in science fiction and related popular culture."
