        "First of all, we need to understand what the native names are. They're all Indian and Indian pronunciations and their names represent the native language, but we need to determine if they belong to the same country or continent. The answer is (B) no, because Lenovo's native name is different from the English language. It is pronounced k-odo-zu-qo. Next, we need to know the native Englishness of the Englishman and Chinese speaker. They are very different native people with different spellings and languages and pronunciations. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the native pronunciation is completely different. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a monolingual American is. Lenovo is an English company. Next, we need to understand what 'configuration' means. A monolingual American is an American who grew up in an unknown country, often from native Asian and Pacific American ancestry. It is commonly assumed that English, Japanese, and Korean is not the standard linguistic language of an American in this country. Now, we need to consider Lenovo's native language: Lenovo is commonly used in English-language marketing campaigns or by online retailers such as Google or Amazon. Now, let's consider what a monolingual American could read. A monolingual American would understand a monolingual computer operating system and understand the language of it. That means, for example, a monolingual American could identify with the term \"contextual\". However, it is not universally understood, and that does not always accurately mean a monolingual person can read Microsoft's native name. In terms of pronunciation, Chinese would be a type of Chinese or latin American. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, a monolingual American cannot read Lenovo's native name. Answer: B",
        "The question asks why a monolingual American can speak a foreign language and can't read Lenovo's native name? According to the American dictionary, a monolingual American is an American citizen who cannot understand English and can't learn a native language. However, a monolingual American can read Lenovo's native name, which is not available in the dictionary. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to establish who a monolingual American is. A monolingual American can be the same as a non-conducer who doesn't speak English or another language. It is important that a monolingual American understands all the languages in order to recognize and understand the specific language that the American uses. Additionally, since a monolingual American can not understand languages or recognize all of its native languages. Thus, the answer is (B) no, a monolingual American cannot read Lenovo's native name. Answer: B",
        "First of all, it is important to understand that the majority of Americans and Europeans don't have any knowledge of English in their own speaking locales. Therefore, a monolinguist can read the native name \"Inteligent Technology.\" Secondly, the American who moved to China with his family in order to learn Chinese, is unable to read the native name, thus assuming he is not in Mandarin as a native speaker. Thirdly, it is important to note that there is not much data to answer this question because of the fact that the language spoken is more foreign to Chinese than other languages. Also, if this is a monolingual American, it is unlikely that he could understand Japanese, German, Spanish, or English. Also, a monolingual American would not be able to comprehend what Lenovo's native name is because he is already used in Chinese translations. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Lenovo . English is Lenovo's official language. Lenovo's CEO, Yang Yuanqing, initially did not understand English well, but relocated his family to Morrisville in order to improve his language skills and learn American ways. One American Lenovo executive interviewed by \"The Economist\" praised Yang for his efforts to make Lenovo a friendly place for foreigners to work. He said that Yang had created a \"performance culture\" in place of the traditional Chinese work style of \"waiting to see what the emperor wants.\""
