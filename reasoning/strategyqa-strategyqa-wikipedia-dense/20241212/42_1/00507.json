Firstly, it is important to recall that smoking cigarettes are not regulated as a form of health care. In fact, smoking cigarettes does not necessarily have the -addiction and addiction quotients typically associated with nicotine distribution or consumption.

        "Nicotine marketing . To imply that some types of cigarettes are healthier than others, marketing also uses brand descriptors such as \"light\", \"mild\", \"natural\", \"gentle\", \"calm\", \"soft\", and \"smooth\". Switching to a product branded to suggest that it is less harmful or addictive (\"mild\", \"light\", \"low-tar\", \"filtered\" etc.) is, in terms of health effects, meaningless. Menthol cigarettes are also marketed as healthier (by implication, using words like \"mild\", \"natural\", \"gentle\", \"calm\", \"soft\", \"smooth\", and imagery of healthy natural environments). There is no evidence that menthol cigarettes are healthier, but there is evidence that they are somewhat easier to become addicted to and harder to quit. Ventilated cigarettes (marketed as \"light\" etc.) do feel cooler, airier, and less harsh, and a smoking machine will give lower tar and nicotine readings for them. But they do not actually reduce human intake or health risks, as a human responds to the lower resistance to breathing through them by taking bigger puffs. They were also designed to be equally addictive, as manufacturers did not want to lose customers."
