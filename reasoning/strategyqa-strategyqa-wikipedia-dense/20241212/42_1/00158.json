        "First, we need to understand who the Four Horsemen are. Four Horsemen is a masculine noble aristocrat who had the four forms of medicine in the name of the four Horsemen of Apocalypse, a prophesy of the cults called \"Hopes\" and \"Three Horsemen.\" Pandora's box contains four Horsemen, an alcohol drink which has three ingredients. Next, we need to understand which items were released from Pandora's box. Each item contains four horses, four horsemen, and a bowl, making these items, and any other items released, can only be released by one of the Four Horsemen brands. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is no, items released from Pandora's box at least two of the Four Horsemen names. Answer: A",
        "1. What is Four Horsemen? Four Horsemen is a drink made by the fasting god Apocalypse. It is a popular drink invented by the Apocalypse author, Alexander of Alexandria. 2. What is four aphrodisiastic? The Four Horsemen are a religiously minded group that have four astrocytosis that resemble a synapse. 3. What is the Four Horsemen? The four Horsemen are a synapse with four Horsemen that are in various forms. 3. What do the Four Horsemen represent? They are a collective of Four Horsemen that are a collectively of four Horsemen that contain the elements \"Wild & Evil\" and \"Apocalypse\". 4. Moreover, the Four Horsemen may contain any of the astrophysical traits associated with \"Wild & Evil.\" Therefore, the answer to the question is yes, even though items from The Four Horsemen (a cocktail called the Four Horsemen) came out from the box, there were at least two of the names of four Horsemen and four Horsemen. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to establish the four Horsemen (feat, sword, and grenade) characters. Pandora's box is a box that is shaped like a stone (called a fox) and is characterized by its four feminine characters . The four female characters, which are adorned with gold coins and a purple ring, are the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Next, we need to determine whether items released from the Pandora's box would contain any of the four Horsemen characters. Therefore, no items could have been released from the Pandora's box, which is entirely fictional and does not contain the Four Horsemen characters. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse were the names of four different drink flavors: Baileys, Cosmos and Pronto, each with a different name (usually referred to as \"Four Horsemen\", meaning four in the description above) and were generally known to mankind and the Ancient Greeks. If they were released on the anniversary of the Apocalypse, it would be possible for the items in the box to contain different kinds of drinks that are well known, such as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. However, the item was not specifically released on the anniversary of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and instead was released as a gift to the Apocalypse. So the answer is (B) no. The item was not released as a gift, and only items released as a gift or gift are currently unknown. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to establish what \" Four Horsemen\" is meant by the \"Four Horsemen\". These four items are: The Four Horsemen (red and gold) or okra. The four Horsemen consists of four whiskeys of alcohol in them, three pintagrams of bitter milk powder (the latter with no alcohol content) and four beer bottles (the former with a little more alcohol content). Next, we need to determine the name of the Four Horsemen. Four Horsemen has an impressive name similar to the Four Horsemen, as it is derived from the word 'O'. The name of the Four Horsemen is given to the spirit of the spirit of the four Horsemen, meaning it symbolize the spirit or spirit of the Four Horsemen. Thus, we have the correct answer, as the item from the Four Horsemen is a cup of rum containing the three beer names. This means that there is an alcohol content difference between the four Horsemen. Since one of the bottle names has a number, the answer to both the question and question answer would be \"A no,\" in that case it would be \"A.\" Answer: B"

        "Four Horsemen (drink) . The Four Horsemen is a cocktail containing four hard liquors and named after the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The name of the drink is derived from the fact that the most common brand names of each ingredient are also male given names and the drinks have a high alcohol content (and therefore tend to have a very strong effect on human physiology). Additionally, the four brand names usually all begin with the letter \"J\" (see sidebar), giving further unity to the concept of the \"Four Horsemen\"."
