        "As we can see, middle classes are predominantly white, or if they are primarily working families, they do not have butlers in them, and therefore they are not capable of maintaining their status. However, on the other hand, the middle class and the upper class have distinct social and economic status. As mentioned, some middle-class families do have some level of social status, while others do not need to work to maintain their status and can continue to maintain their status despite these people. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) yes, most middle class families have butlers. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, we need to recognize the middle-class, meaning those who are economically well-off and who have a high social status are in a middle class. Secondly, we need to identify the type of family we are seeking. In this type of family, a butler is a leading social figure who performs household chores and serves a broader role in society by taking a proactive approach by doing so. Thirdly, we need to understand what middle-class families are. Middle-class families in America are predominantly social individuals who are both economically and politically active. For example, in the middle-class, there is the need for a primary child or teacher or other caregiver, and the majority of upper-class people are not socialized or educated enough to be considered for the job as they do. This is because the middle-class doesn't have the means to maintain their social status while doing household chores, such as a washing or house sweep. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, most middle-class families do not have butlers. Answer: B",
        "1. How are the upper class and the middle class? 2. Do they both have the same roles? 3. In reality, middle class means that a high-class family is less likely to be of some type of economic reason. 4. How is the status of the upper class determined? 5. Why would some people think they have inherited an upper class family? 3. These two figures are similar in their roles as upper-class members and a higher class may or may not hold a senior position. 5. Generally, upper-class people tend to have more family wealth and need to maintain their social class, as they do not have the same work or family background they are referred to in this question. 6. They do not have the same skills or qualifications as the upper class. 7. This requires them to be more willing to take on responsibility versus doing so. 8. At the same time, they need to stay fit and in shape compared to upper class members. While not everyone's upper-class individual needs to be more creative or creative, some do have the same traits as their other peers or friends. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, and they do have their butlers. This is because they are not the upper class members themselves and do not want to be close friends or neighbors. 9. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what middle class families are. Middle class families typically have children, who have both a parent and a daughter. Second, we need to consider what are butlers. They are members of the upper class that provide the child with a home care experience, as well as a support system for the family. Now, we need to consider what is considered a butler. Abuthers are an elevated person who are considered to have full social status in their respective families. They tend to be considered independent from their parent. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, most middle class families do not have butlers. Answer: B",
        "In the middle class, middle class is predominantly English-speaking, suffocate, and have an upper-middle-class social class. While it can be somewhat spooky for some people to be the middle class, there are still ways to maintain and expand their social classes. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that all middle-class families have butlers. However, this is no longer the case for the most middle-class families, with the majority of families in the upper class having multiple butlers. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that most of the upper class have butlers, and therefore, this is not what the question states. Answer: A"

        "Social class in the United States . Yet another important feature of the upper class is that of inherited privilege. While most Americans, including those in the upper-middle class need to actively maintain their status, some upper class persons do not need to work in order to maintain their status. Status tends to be passed on from generation to generation without each generation having to re-certify its status. Overall, the upper class is financially the best compensated and one of the most influential socio-economic classes in American society."
