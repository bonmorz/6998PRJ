        "First, we need to understand who the Big Show is and what is meant by topple. Topple is a phrase used to refer to a figure that is placed on a stage or event. The title of Big Show is essentially the same as what is stated on the front of the stage. This means the total crowd size of the big show and the amount of force can be determined by the force of the Big Show. Next, we need to consider the weight range of a cheetah. Using weights, like a 100-pound body and an unlimited amount of energy, a cheetah could produce up to 1,000 pounds (the number of calories per cheetah), which would typically be enough to topple Big Show. Since these factors are related, it is safe to assume that this cheetah could generate enough force to surpass Big Show. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand how a cheetah is represented. A cheetah is a species of cat that has facial markings that it typically resemble an animal, while a cheetah is known for having a thick tail and a tethered body. Next, we need to consider the size of Big Show. Big Show is a musical event at the 2019 Sunderland Festival. It is regarded as a tribute to the musical artists and musical composers who rose to prominence in the entertainment industry by creating the show's headlines. In other words, the cheetah is an animal that is typically muscular in shape and muscular in form. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, a cheetah cannot produce enough force to toplep the show at the first opportunity. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define what Big Show is. Big Show is a 2005 feature film that starred Paul Betts, Adam Jones, and Chris Rockman. Next, we need to understand a cheetah and how it works. A cheetah is a humane, and it does not have a stomach. Therefore, a cheetah would not have enough force to push a giant jump or relive Big Show. Consequently, we can safely assume that a cheetah cannot generate enough force to topple Big Show. In fact, a cheetah can only produce up to two, to the scale, of Big Show. Therefore, based on what we know, and the fact that cheetah's body height depends on a number of factors, which may or may not allow for a cheetah to achieve enough force to topple Big Show. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, a cheetah can generate enough force to topple Big Show. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what a cheetah is. A cheetah is a mammal that has a solid body, thick, thick legs, and sharp and slender body. As we said, a cheetah does not have a resemblance to a human body. This means that a cheetah can only generate power and power through eating, eating, and drinking. Now we need to answer the question about generating sufficient force to topple Big Show. According to an expert who knows cheetahs and lions, a cheetah cannot generate enough force to topple Big Show. This is because it is a mammal that is small, but can withstand impact and do many tasks. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, a cheetah can generate enough force to topple Big Show. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to know what Big Show is. The Big Show is a live animal television show, run by human actors and entertainers. The stage hosts and audience are all humans, and humans are creatures. Next, a cheetah has a large and sensitive belly and a long beard. These features all contribute to the giant size of the show. First of all, cheetahs are animals, which means they can produce high and powerful force to perform tasks or be physically strong. Their legs are narrow, and they have large toes and chests. Next, the power of their body and legs are different and depend on which side of their body would you stand. Considering cheetahs' size and weight, Big Show is a much smaller game show, with a bigger lead than the show. Hence, the correct answer is (B) yes, a cheetah can generate enough force to topple Big Show. Answer: B"

        "Cheetah . The cheetah is a felid with several distinctive featuresa slender body, deep chest, spotted pelage, a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, long thin legs and a long spotted tail. Its lightly built, slender form is in sharp contrast with the robust build of the big cats. The head-and-body length ranges from . Adult cheetahs average at the shoulder, and weigh . It is taller than the leopard, which stands nearly at the shoulder. The weight range of the cheetah overlaps with that of the leopard, which weighs . On the other hand, the cheetah is significantly shorter than the lion, whose average height is nearly . Moreover, it is much lighter than the lion, among which females weigh and the much heavier males weigh . Based on measurements, the smallest cheetahs have been reported from the Sahara, northeastern Africa and Iran. A sexually dimorphic species, males are generally larger than females."
