        "First, it is important to understand who Eve and Chad were during the time they were related. Chad was also a professional basketball player, while Whitney was a professional athlete. Now, imagine if it is true that they were not involved in an incestuous relationship. We assume that they were involved in the high-school friendship, as they knew each other's life.

Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that Eve was involved in an incestous relationship with Chad. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, it is possible that Eve did not participate in an incestuous relationship. Answer: A"
