        "First, we need to understand the Nepalese Civil War. The Nepalese Civil War is a civil war fought between the British and Nepali rulers during the second world war. Now, let's consider India. India was the Principal Land of Nepal. They signed the Treaty of Sajpattaka in 1814. The Nepalese Government signed the Treaty of Amerika in 1815. Thus, the Nepalese had fought against India's rival states in India at the same time, which was the center of the conflict. Therefore, the Nepalese Civil War did not take place in India, as the Nepalese Government held a major stake in their territory. Finally, the Nepalese government decided to attack India as part of the process, to protect and enforce the treaty. Therefore, the Nepalese Civil War did not take place in India. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to know what Nepalese Civil War took place. Nepal was located in British India and it was part of the British Empire until the late 19th century. Finally, we need to know what was going on in India. It happened in 1847, 1701, 1840, and 1845 respectively. Next, we need to understand if the Nepalese Civil War took place outside India. India was a state and territory between the British and Eastern European empires, which was the region of the Nepalese Civil War. As a result, the British Empire fought the Nepalese Civil War battles in the western area of India. This led to the Nepalese Civil War, which involved the Anglo-Nepalese War (called the Anglo-Nepalese War). Therefore, it is impossible for Nepalese Civil War to take place in India, due to the fact that India and Nepal were not entirely involved in the occupying countries. It is possible that there would have been some time in India if the Nepalese Civil War had not been part of the Western European conflict, which took place in India. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, Nepal did not participate in the Nepalese Civil War and there is no doubt about this. Answer: B",
        "First, we know that the Nepalese Civil War was a dynasty in Nepal and India that is today. It took place in 1814\u201316, in which the British Empire occupied parts of Indian territories to protect them. After these two events, Nepal was renamed Nepal and the United States fought alongside each other until 1628, when the British Government intervened in the midst of the Anglo-Nepalese War. This war was known to have lasted for decades before India returned to its control. Hence, the answer to this question is (A) yes, the Nepalese Civil War took place in Nepal and India. Answer: A",
        "D: What is a Nepalese Civil War? A Nepalese Civil War (northeast) took place in the North Indian states of Nepal, Tibet and Nepal between 1771 and 1792. What's important about this is that it's still a common practice for these countries to fight for their interests. However, if we look at the map of Nepal and India, we can see that Nepal is the largest country in Central Asia. Attitudes from the region during the war are slightly different and often far out in the past. The Nepalese Civil War took place in Uttara, Rajasthan, which is not a small place and is not completely isolated from the Indian states. Hence the answer to the question is (B) no, the Nepalese Civil War did not take place in Nepal. This fact means that while Nepal is one of the countries that are associated with the country as it is, they are far away in the north Indian state, which is not completely covered by government jurisdictions or borders. Answer: B",
        "First, what was the Nepalese Civil War? The Nepalese Civil War was a series of several conflict and fought between Nepal and India. The conflict started in 1814, after a conflict in Nepal between India and Nepal, in the Indian state of Sikkim. The conflict involved partition and partitioning of various kingdoms, which the Nepali government had declared as a state of autonomy in 1816, and eventually ended in 1819, which was a year after India. On the other hand, it was a battle between Nepal and the two major kingdoms in India, which ultimately led to the Battle of the Three Kings and the Anglo-Nepalese Confederation. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, the Nepalese Civil War did not take place near India, and it is important to learn the facts and facts before making your choice. Answer: B"

        "Kingdom of Nepal . Rivalry between Nepal and the East India Company\u2014over the princely states bordering Nepal and India\u2014eventually led to the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814\u201316), in which Nepal was defeated. The Treaty of Sugauli was signed in 1816, ceding large parts of the Nepali territories of Terrai and Sikkim, (nearly one third of the country), to the British, in exchange for Nepalese autonomy. As the territories were not restored to Nepal by the British when freedom was granted to the people of British India, these have become a part of the Republic of India, although the people of Sikkim decided in a public referendum in 1975 to merge the kingdom in India and become a state in the Republic of India. After losing the land, the East India Company decided to give some of territories back to Nepal."
