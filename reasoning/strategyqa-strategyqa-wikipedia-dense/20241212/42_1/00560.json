        "First, we need to define hurricane force winds. Hurricane force winds are the winds that cause the turbulence or turbulence of a hurricane and the impact of a major hurricane. Hurricane force winds, even when there is a hurricane, can increase the turbulence or even cause wind damage. Therefore, we can infer that Parachuting amateurs can not ignore hurricane force winds. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, parachuting amateurs can not ignore hurricane force winds bulletins. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define the difference between a parachuter and a real person. Parachuters can use more than one type of rope to move safely around a terrain. They can also use weather instruments to prevent accidents or dangerous winds. Since hurricanes have a very high wind speed and can travel up to speeds of up to 1,000 kilometres, parachuting amateurs can assume the following is true based on information from the website of Parachuting USA: Parachuting USA: Parachuting America: Parachuting USA: Parachuting USA: Parachutating a. The first step is to identify the route based on the weather information about the hurricane. This helps to identify what type of hurricane is based on their speed, speed, or type of object. This also helps to keep in mind the type of storms that are based on the weather information given at this point in time. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, parachuting amateurs can ignore hurricane force winds. Answer: A",
        "First, it is important to note that hurricane force winds are generally very strong winds that can be made by any type of storm. Hurricane force winds may have high winds or even have high speeds, but cannot be made by the pilots. Additionally, the number of hurricanes can play into large amounts. The higher the storm's speed and winds, the better chance of losing control or even destroying the ship or plane. Also, the higher the winds, the greater the turbulence of the storm. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes. Parachuting amateurs can ignore hurricane force winds bulletins. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to define what hurricane force winds is. Hurricane force winds are caused by updraughts or thunderstorms that have been created by thunderstorms in tropical, tropical or tropical storms, such as hurricanes at high speeds. Now, we need to define the type of the subject, which we can assume is parachuter amateurs, with a strong interest in the nature of their actions. Hurricanes tend to be a large, strong storm that can affect their landings, shelters, and even destroy other objects or vehicles. Now, let's look at the answer to the question, isn't it possible for parachuting amateurs to ignore hurricane force winds bulletins? Hurricane force winds bulletins may be issued by the government, while parachuting amateurs can rely on the government's guidance to avoid such notices. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"no\" (-B-C-B-C-B-C-B-C-B-C-C-B-C-D-W-B-C-D-C-B-C-D-B-C-B-C-A-C-B-F-H-B-C-B-C-S-W-D-B-C-B-C-D-D-C-E-D-S-A-B-C-C-B-C-B-C-B-C-D-F-B-C-B-C-D-A-C-B-C-B-C-D-B-C-D-B-C-B-C-C-D-B-C-D-A-C-B-C-E-B-C-D-C-F-D-B-C-D-B-C-F-C-D-B-C-E-C-B-C-D-C-E-B-C-B-C-C-B-C-C-D-C-D-B-C-D-B-C-B-C-D-B-C-S-D-B-C-D-H-C-A-C-D-B-C-B-D-C-D-F-B-C-D-D-B-C-D-C-C-A-C-D-D-B-C-C-D-B-C-D-B-D-C-C-D-E-A-C-B-C-D-B-C-D-C-D-G-S-S-D-C-B-D-B-C-D-B-C-B-C-D-D-C-B-C-D-B-C-D-A-D-C-C-D-B-C-D-B-C-D-B-C-D-B-C-D-B-C-C-B-C-C-D-D-B-C-D-D-D-B-C-B-T-D-B-C-D-D-B-C-D-C-D-B-C-B-C-D-D-B-C-D-D-B-C-D-B-C-D-B-C-E-F-D-B-C-D-C-D-F-A-C-B-C-D-D-B-C-D-B-C-D-B-C-D-D-A-C-D-D-A-C-D-B-F-D-B-C-D-B-C-D-B-C-D-C-D-B--B-C-D-D-B-C-D-A-F-H-C-C-D-D-A-C-D-D-B-D-C-D-B-C-D-A-F-F-A-C-D-B-C-D-A-S-D-B-C-D-C-E-D-B-A-S-B-B-C-D-B-C-D-B-C-D-W-C-D-B-C-D-B-C-D-A-C-C-D-A-D-B-C-D-B-C-D-B-C-D-D-C-D-D-C-D-D-A-B-C-D-B-C-D-A-B",
        "First, hurricane force winds is the wind speed of a hurricane that causes waves or storms to form. Next, parachuting amateurs are trained by aeronautical professionals who are trained at using equipment such as helicopters and helicopters in order to avoid the dangers and erratic behavior of hurricanes. Secondly, hurricane force winds involve the wind blowing through clouds or snow. The wind blowing over cloud and snow from the surface can cause several dangerous things including thunder, lightning, and other sudden weather events. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, parachuters can not ignore hurricane force winds bulletins. Answer: B"

        "Cumulonimbus and aviation . In general, updraughts reach their maximum intensity at above the ground. At this altitude, a phase change occurs where water droplets become ice crystals and therefore release energy in the form of latent heat and thus the updraught strength increases. Supercell thunderstorms or derechos can have gigantic updraughts at this altitude, updraughts with speeds that can exceed . Such an updraught speed corresponds to the wind speed of a small hurricane. The speed can even exceed . The maximum number in the Beaufort scale is 12 (\"hurricane force\" wind) and is assigned to wind speeds of 64\u00a0knots or greater. If the Beaufort scale were extended, these updraughts would have a Beaufort number of 14 \"in the vertical direction\". The turbulence is then \"extreme\" at this altitude."
