        "First, we need to understand what Thanksgiving is and what it means to be a day of mourning. Thanksgiving is a traditional holiday celebrated for commemorating the loss of an ethnic minority. It's a time to express remembrance and acceptance of others' sufferings. The days of mourning include \"feasts\" (in some cultures), funerals, and funerals. The term \"day of mourning\" refers to the re-birth of someone or event on this day.

Therefore, in terms of the present time of the holiday, it seems like it is a day of mourning for all the people who spent their time fighting or dying around the world. Next, we need to compare Thanksgiving to other events. According to Thanksgiving itself, it's a celebration of the cultural genocide that supposedly happened in America back in the 1850s. It's true that there is not much to celebrate. In fact, not much has been done to make it a day of mourning. For example, during Thanksgiving Day's celebration, there are a wide variety of events and people who like to break the bread. Additionally, Thanksgiving is often viewed as an opportunity to mourn. We can either choose to do this or we can do both. It's unlikely to hurt people who are grieving at the end of the year.

Consequently, the answer to the question is probably (A) no, Thanksgiving isn't a day of mourning for Thanksgiving. Answer: A",

        "Thanksgiving (United States) . Much like Columbus Day, Thanksgiving is considered by some to be a \"national day of mourning\", as a celebration of the cultural genocide and conquest of Native Americans by colonists. Thanksgiving has long carried a distinct resonance for Native Americans, who see the holiday as an embellished story of \"Pilgrims and Natives looking past their differences\" to break bread. Professor Dan Brook of the University of California, Berkeley condemns the \"cultural and political amnesia\" of Americans who celebrate Thanksgiving: \"We do not have to feel guilty, but we do need to feel something.\" Professor Robert Jensen of the University of Texas at Austin is somewhat harsher: \"One indication of moral progress in the United States would be the replacement of Thanksgiving Day and its self-indulgent family feasting with a National Day of Atonement accompanied by a self-reflective collective fasting.\" Some of the controversy regarding Thanksgiving have been used to justify the Christmas creep (the act of putting up Christmas decorations before Thanksgiving). Those who sympathize with this view acknowledge it as a small minority view; author and humanist John G. Rodwan, who does not celebrate Thanksgiving, noted \"If you put forth the interpretation (...) that touches on the dishonorable treatment of the native population that lived in what became the United States, then you are likely to be dismissed as some sort of crank(.)\""
