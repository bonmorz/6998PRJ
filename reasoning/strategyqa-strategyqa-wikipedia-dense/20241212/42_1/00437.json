        "First, we need to understand the orbital range of the Hwasong-15 missile (known as North Korea\u2019s Hwasong-15). This missile has been designated as a long, detailed, and extensive satellite-based probe, so the answer is (A) no. It has an orbit of 10\u201315 nautical miles, and can travel a distance of 8\u201312 miles. It is difficult to use the same technology to the right-hand side of the question, but it is possible. A Hwasong-15 missile will travel about 15 miles in 4.5 hours. This means it could reach an altitude of more than 1,200 miles, yet does it have a good trajectory? The range of the Hwasong-15 missile depends on the orbits of each missile and the distance of its trajectory. Thus, the correct answer to the question is (B) no; a Hwasong-15 missile would not reach the Voyager 2, as it would have to be located in a few thousand miles (2,000 kilometers) away from Earth. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, the answer is (A) yes, a Hwasong-15 missile. Next, we need to determine where Voyager 2 is located. Voyager 2 is a space station located in the United Kingdom. Next, we need to determine the range of the Hwasong-15 missile. It was reported that it could take between 3 to 6 months to complete its flight. Now, if we actually know what the range is, we can say that the Hwasong-15 missile would have a range of 3,063 km - 1,700 km, which is approximately 4 times the range of the Voyager 4. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, we need to understand what a Hwasong-15 missile is. A Hwasong-15 is a type of rocket that carries a hefty, high-tech air-dropper trajectory and travels over 1,200 miles (400 kilometers) and has a range of approximately 3,100 miles (160 km). Therefore, a missile with the heaviest range of the Hwasong-15 is not able to reach a Voyager 2 range. Since they don't have any radar or payload capabilities, they do not have the ability to use radar or payload capabilities, and a Hwasong-15 missile with its low altitude and relatively short range can take up to 43 kilometers (680 minutes). Therefore, an Hwasong-15 missile should be able to reach a Voyager2 range of about 330 kilometers \u2014 just under 8,000 km2 (58 km) from Japan. According to a science writer, a Hwasong-15 missile would have a speed of 3,600 km/h (59 km/h) to reach a hefty 1,200 miles (1,250 km) \u2014 enough to reach the Voyager2 target. However, most modern air-port vehicles (such as the jetliners), typically have a speed of up to 100 kilometers/hour, while the Hwasong-15 would only have a short flight of only 60 km/h (66 km). Therefore, the answer is (B) no, a Hwasong-15 missile could not reach the Voyager 2 range of 550 miles (800 km) by using a high-power, light-powered rocket. Similarly, a high-energy Hwasong-15 missile would have a hefty distance of 3,100 miles (58 km) and a relatively short range \u2014 and can only travel to a distance of over 1,800 miles (100 km). This means that the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine the range of a Hwasong-15 missile and its range. Depending on the range, the Hwasong-15 can reach a range of more than 121,000 km, which is a long, high-speed range. Next, we need to determine the range of Voyager 2. The distance is 4,475 km and the rocket's speed measured at 15,982 km/sec. Similarly, the speed of the Hwasong-15 missile is about 1340 km/sec, which is about the size of a US-based rocket. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. The answer is (B) no. B",
        "First, we need to consider the feasibility of the Hwasong-15 missile. The Hwasong-15 missile could not be launched from North Korea. It is unlikely for a missile to reach the spaceship Voyager 2 due to its immense range. Next, we need to establish the distance of the missile. Since the missile traveled approximately 4,475 km, it would reach a distance of 1,870 km. This means that the missile would be capable of abit beyond the distance of the missile if measured correctly. In the opinion of U.S. nationalists, it is highly unlikely that a missile could reach the spaceship while not being hit by any of its outer features. Assuming a Hwasong-15 missile can be launched into space, it would have a total distance of 24,000 km. Since the missile would have a maximum range of 2500 km, it would have the capacity to reach the spaceship and, in turn, reach the spaceship safely. Thus, the answer to the question (B) is (B) yes. Answer: B"

        "Hwasong-15 . North Korea stated that the missile reached an altitude of around 4,475\u00a0km and traveled some 950\u00a0km downrange with a flight time of 53 minutes. Based on its trajectory and distance, the missile would have a range of more than 13,000\u00a0km (8,100 miles) \u2013 more than enough to reach Washington D.C. and the rest of the United States, albeit with a reduced payload according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. In addition, the range covers several of the United States\u2019s international allies such as the United Kingdom and France, as well as all of Earth's continents, except South America and most of Antarctica."
