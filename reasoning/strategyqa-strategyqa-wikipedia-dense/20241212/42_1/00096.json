        "First, we need to understand who Shirley Bassey is and what she wrote in her 1971 concert song \"The Diamond Rule.\" On the other hand, we will need to consider if this a true statement, because it is clear that Bassey never recorded the \"Diamond Rule\" as it stands. So, as she recorded the song, it cannot be definitively stated that it is a true statement. We can simply answer the question without giving any information about the sentence. Since the question asks the correct answer, it's safe to assume that this is true, but should be considered false. Since the question is asking if it is true that Bassey's album \"I'm Not a Diamond Rule,\" then it's safe to assume that it is a false statement. On the other hand, we can see from the context of the word \"Diamond Rule,\" which is a reference to the song's lyrics or lyrics. During the history of the song, it is clear that it was written or written in the early 1960s while playing her version of \"La Vite,\" a rockabilly theme to a famous singer in 1932. In her 1971 concert, this is a quote from Bassey, \"There's only one era in this song.\" Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, based on that statement, it is still valid and true. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who Shirley Bassey is. Shirley Bassey is a British singer, pianist, and actor who performed many musical genres and styles during her career. Next, we need to consider the title of her 1971 diamond song. According to an interview with The Ringing Times, Bassey's single was not necessarily a true statement, as it might not be true. Since it is true, it is impossible for people to believe that the title is true, because there was no actual proof of what it was. It is possible to guess what the question is asking. The title of the 1971 diamond song is a true statement, so the correct answer is (B) yes. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to recognize Shirley Bassey's 1971 diamond song: The Diamond. Bassey's song was the most popular song of her career before 1966 and was his biggest song during her career. Since a number of songs and famous singers have died in her career, this is the only way to determine the truth and authenticity of the title of her 1971 diamond song. Assuming this number one song is based on her own biography of herself, it is possible that we can conclude that the title is an accurate description of the song's popularity. In the case of \"La vita\", \"La vita\" is not a true statement. Since Bassey has been known for playing in front of the theater, it is very unlikely that her song would be considered a true statement, especially if she would have played on a stage. This is especially true for the song \"Blessing of the Diamond,\" which was recorded in 1960. However, the title is not necessarily true. Based on this information, it is very possible that the diamond song might be a true statement. Thus, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to establish who Shirley Bassey is. She was a British recording artist who was a prominent figure in a pop rock movement who achieved her peak after 1970. The diamond song La vita, which is also credited to the song, is a traditional rock song that has been famously played on many different popular albums since the 1950s. Next, we need to determine the title of the 1971 CD release of her diamond song. This was a song by her self, recorded in 1972 with the accompaniment of the violin. It had the title of a musical song. This meant that it was composed and performed by the artist who recorded the single that had the most hit sales in the world. Finally, we can consider the difference between the title of the Diamond Song and the song that the song itself was recorded with. We know that the song is named \"Time\" and the title is based on the song's meaning in lyrics. This meant that the resulting fact was known to be inaccurate. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, the title of Shirley Bassey's 1971 Diamond Song is the true answer. Answer: B",
        "First, the title of Shirley Bassey's 1971 diamond song is not a true statement. It's a true story and not a true statement. Now, what would be the best title for this true story? There's not much to indicate about it. It just a fictional song. According to the legend, there is no mention of any other true stories to be heard on the internet. Finally, we can use the fact that Shirley Bassey's 1971 diamond song is also a true statement. The title of the song \"This Is My Life\" is the most famous song of Shirley Bassey and her career. It is not a true statement or a false statement. However, it has been known to be true and may have been popularized through the past years, or even into the 20th century. Since these facts are not true, the answer is (B) no, and the title of the 1963 Shirley Bassey Diamond Singing Diamonds is not true. Answer: B"

        "Shirley Bassey . Bassey began to live as a tax exile in 1968, and was unable to work in Britain for almost two years. Also in 1968, at the Sanremo Festival in Italy, she performed \"La vita\", an Italian song by Bruno Canfora and Antonio Amurri, with some lyrics re-written in English by Norman Newell for her. Bassey's version of the song, with its chorus sung in Italian, became a Top 40 hit in Italy. Bassey recorded several songs in Italian, some appearing on the album \"La vita\" (1968). (Later, Newell would write English lyrics for the rest of \"La vita\", and the result was \"This Is My Life\".) But her UK sales continued to suffer. Bassey's UK comeback came in 1970, leading to one of the most successful periods of her career. Starting the year with a BBC Television 'Special' \"The Young Generation Meet Shirley Bassey\", recorded in Sweden and shown on BBC1 on 18 March. She returned to the UK with a record-breaking run of performances at the Talk of the Town nightclub. Also that year, her album \"Something\" was released, and showcased a new Bassey style, a shift from traditional pop to more contemporary songs and arrangements (the eponymous single was more successful in the UK charts than the original recording by The Beatles) \u2013 although Bassey would never completely abandon what that had been her forte: standards, show tunes, and torch songs."
