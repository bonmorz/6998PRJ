        "First of all, Robert Stack was the famed playwright of the 15th Century and is well known for his role as The King in the 14th century. Next, we need to determine what it was about the Tower of London at the time of the King and his successor, who lived from 1248 to 1353. If it was not in the 14th century the Tower of London was still an important military building in the 15th and 16th centuries, and it was still a major cultural landmark, making it probably a very interesting site for a story of a stork. Next, it's important to note that it was a very important location for Robert Stack, and it was a place he would want to visit in the future. He would need to go near the White Tower during this period of his history, which is known as the Tower of London. Therefore, it is not a question that Robert Stack would have been interested in during the 14th century as it would have occupied his time and role in the preservation of the Tower. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) yes. We can answer this question with the correct answer (B) correct answer: B",
        "- We need information about Robert Stack's 14-year history of doing a show of the Tower of London for 14-year shows. - Robert Stack performed a 14-week series of the show on 1 July 1214, and his series of events was also in 1404, so it is possible that Robert Stack would have been interested in the Tower of London during 1404, and not the 14-years in which the show was run. Thus, we need to answer the question. The correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to identify what Robert Stack is. Robert Stack is an actor and comedian who worked for television shows like \"B\", \"Bright Star\", \"Wheck!\", and \"Bright Star\" and \"Bondee.\" Stack died in the 12th century, and it is unlikely that he would have been interested in the Tower of London during the first 14 years of his life. Next, we must identify when the Tower of London was built. For example, the tower was built in 1468-45, and the Tower of London was built in 1490-452. To be sure, it was not built in 2014 when Stack was working for a year, though. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Robert Stack would have been interested in the Tower of London during the late 1400s. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to know the specific location of the Tower of London. It was established in the 17th century and is named after King Edward II who remained king throughout his reign. Now, we know that Robert Stack did not visit the Tower during the 14-year period from which he is talking about his upcoming 14-year-old show, The 14-Year-Hallington. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. The Tower of London was built in the 16th-century, however, and since it was in the 13th century, it was no longer available. However, in the 19th century, the Tower of London was expanded and decommissioned during a period of time. This meant that Robert Stack would have been interested in the Tower of London during the 14-year period. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, Robert Stack would not have been interested in the Tower of London during the 14-year period, instead it would have been based on a few factors, including the building being constructed. It may have been constructed with a strong foundation and light beams that made it appear bright and impressive. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to establish what Robert Stack is. Robert Stack is a famous British inventor, who became famous for the death of his family in 1818 during the Great Depression. He was famous for his design of the Tower of London, an important landmark in the United Kingdom. It was known as the Queen's residence and a model of the King's castle, known for its royal significance in royal life and royalty. Next, we need to consider if he would have liked to see the Tower of London during the 1600s. The Tower of London is a landmark in London and was named for its queen's head. Therefore, he would have been interested in the Tower of London during his 14 season show. However, he is not known for his particular role as a painter or designer, so he might not have had the courage to take risks and explore his art and cultural heritage. To answer the question, we need to look into historical evidence that suggest Robert Stack was popular in his time, including the 17th century, which featured a number of famous famous artists. Additionally, Robert Stack's \"Flemale Knights\" show featured several scenes of cultural icons, from London's Royal Horseshoe (Bound of London) to his own unique outfit, as well as a set of art. Whether or not he would have enjoyed visiting the Tower of London during his 14 seasons or at least some enjoyment in King's palace, he would have enjoyed that type of \"It's A Wonderful Life\" episode. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, Robert Stack would have not had been interested in the Tower of London during his 14 seasons during his 14 seasons. Answer: B"

        "White Tower (Tower of London) . The White Tower was multi-purpose. It was the castle's strongest point militarily yet provided accommodation fit for the king and his representatives. In Norman architecture the keep was a symbol of a lord's power. The White Tower was probably complete by 1100 at the latest, at which point it was used to imprison Ranulf Flambard, Bishop of Durham. It was probably during Henry\u00a0II's reign (1154\u20131189) that a forebuilding was added to the south side of the tower to provide extra defences to the entrance, but it has not survived. Henry\u00a0III's relations with his barons were uneasy, and in the 1220s and 1230s he enhanced the castle's defences and domestic buildings. Though the work he started may not have been finished within his lifetime, he extended the castle to the north and east, building a new stone wall to enclose the castle. A brattice (a timber gallery) was added to the top of the White Tower, projecting beyond its walls to better defend the base of the tower. Henry also undertook maintenance of the White Tower and it was during his reign that the tradition of whitewashing the building began. In March 1240 the Keeper of the Works at the Tower of London was ordered \"to have the Great Tower whitened both inside and out\". Later that year the king wrote to the Keeper, commanding that the White Tower's lead guttering should be extended with the effect that \"the wall of the tower\u00a0... newly whitened, may be in no danger of perishing or falling outwards through the trickling of the rain\". Henry did not explain his order to whitewash the keep, but may have been influenced by contemporary fashion in Europe to paint prestigious buildings white. He also added decoration to the chapel in the keep, adding stained glass, statues, and paintings. Activity at the castle in the early 14th\u00a0century declined relative to previous periods. Though the Tower of London was still occasionally used as a residence, by the 1320s the chapel in the White Tower was used to store records. This marked the beginning of the castle's diminishing role as a royal residence. The records were briefly removed from the White Tower in 1360 to accommodate the captive French king, John\u00a0II. It may have been during the reign of Edward\u00a0III (1327\u20131377) that a building abutting the south side of the White Tower was created. Built as storage, it may have been part of Edward's building programme at the Tower of London which saw its role as a military store come to the fore. The structure no longer survives, but is recorded on plans from 1597 and 1717."
