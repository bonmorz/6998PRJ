        "1. A white coffee drink is a white drink that contains milk, cocoa powder, or any sweetener. 2. A white coffee drink is typically made with cream or milk or coconut cream. 3. No cream in coffee, like cream coffee, requires no butter or eggs to be incorporated into the flavor of the coffee. 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Kylee Jenner would not ask for cream in her coffee. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what it means for a coffee beverage to contain milk, cream, or other milk. Milk is sometimes used in other kinds of beverages such as, keelaos, rums, and liquor. Next, we need to investigate whether or not Kylee Jenner would ask for no cream in her coffee? It is often assumed that she would make the mistake of asking her not to use cream as part of coffee. Next, we need to consider whether or not she would use cream in her drink. When asking this, we believe it would have a more pleasant flavor than any of the other ingredients she had been trying to replace. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, Kylee Jenner would ask for no cream in her coffee because she is trying to make a more fair choice instead of using milk or cream. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what cream is and what it is specifically called. Cream is an essential ingredient in coffee, making it an alternative to milk or other flavor profiles found in other coffee or tea recipes. First, we need to consider Kylee Jenner's other notable beverages, such as coffee, and she is known for their taste and texture. In her case, she is known for being a very sweet and enthusiastic aficionado. Now, we need to answer what we need to know: Why would a person ask for no cream in their coffee? First, we need to understand what cream is and what it is. In some coffee flavors, it is the perfect flavor to create a creamy flavor, even if topped with no cream (milk or other flavor ingredients). This type of milk is not an appropriate drink to serve. Instead, it's highly recommended for other recipes and beverages that require the combination of cream and milk (including, say, whipped cream). Lastly, the overall aim of Jenner's coffee is for her to create the perfect ambiance in her cafe by pouring coffee over a light layer of syrup. It is important to note that each cup contains a specific flavor, so it is safe to assume Jenner would rather have an exception to this rule. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, I don't have the answer. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what white coffee is. White coffee refers to coffee made with milk, but also includes sugar, sugar, and alcohol. Next, we need to consider whether her coffee may contain any milk in it, if so. There is no evidence of milk in Jenner's coffee. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what Kylee Jenner is. As a young American and South Korean actor and singer, who also has a strong fan base, she is known for her dark, smoky personality and high-calorie content. Next, we need to consider the ingredients in her coffee: butter, milk, sugar, and vanilla bean. These ingredients can be added to enhance the sweetness of the coffee. This is an indication that she would be reluctant to use cream in her coffee, as she may not like white tea, nor consider the added nutritional value of cream in her coffee. Therefore, in order to avoid any additional ingredients on her coffee, it is necessary to substitute milk or sugar for the ingredients in the coffee. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, Kylee Jenner would not intentionally choose to use milk in her coffee. Answer: B"

        "White coffee . In many English-speaking countries, \"white coffee\" is used to refer to regular black coffee that has had milk, cream or some other \"whitener\" added to it, though the term is almost entirely unheard of in the US, where the same beverage might be called \"coffee light\" in the New York City area, \"light coffee\", \"coffee with milk,\" or \"regular coffee\" in New England and New York City. Cream varieties, often called \"creamers\" in the US, can be made of dairy milk, corn syrup derivatives, soy, or nut products. Sweeteners used include cane sugar or artificial ingredients."
