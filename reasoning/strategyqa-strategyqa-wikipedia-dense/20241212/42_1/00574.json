        "First, what does the word \"abringance\" mean? A hedgehog is a wild animal species that feeds, and it has the ability to be in various situations. Next, what does a typical hedgehog's purpose or behavior is? A hedgehog is a genus or group of small and common birds that lives in the wild, and it is considered to be a type of wild bird with the ability to escape. They have a unique ability to fend off predators, such as birds or kung-oos. Therefore, an invasive hedgehog does not have an ability to avoid animals in a risky, detrimental environment. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, a hedgehog would avoid animals without a spinal cord. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to determine the nature of hedgehogs. Hedgehogs have a unique ability to be agitated by a body shaking. Therefore, their posture and behavior depend on their body type and natural inclinations. Therefore, based on its ability to avoid situations that require them, hedgehogs are more likely to avoid such situations. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that they would need to have a functioning spinal cord to handle an attack. Therefore, it is safe for hedgehogs to ignore situations that could pose an emergency or threaten others. Therefore, a hedgehog is unlikely to avoid an unsafe situation with its own body mass, which would require their own consciousness and energy. Therefore, based on our knowledge, hedgehogs may not be able to avoid the situations that would result from an accident or injury. Thus, the answer is (A) yes, it is unlikely that a hedgehog would avoid animals without a spinal cord. Answer: A",
        "A hedgehog is a species of dog that are typically unable to escape from a cage and uses its tail to avoid a predator in a shelter or other environment. A typical hedgehog is a bird with a long tail, has a foot that is longer than a foot, and can easily move with its tail. A simulated animal without a spinal cord would probably avoid a predator because it has no spinal cord and no sense of safety. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, a hedgehog cannot avoid animals without a spinal cord. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know the nature of a hedgehog's habitat. If it is a hedgehog, it is not likely that it would do this before it was introduced to the world. Therefore, it would not be wise to make animals with a neurological connection to the nesting ground. It is important to recognize that some animals are also animals, and many hedgehogs do not have a neurological connect to the nesting ground. Therefore, one hedgehog can't escape without a neurological connection with it. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes, a hedgehog would probably avoid animals without a neurological connection. Answer: B",
        "First, definition of a hedgehog is a small animal that is living in a habitat and has no ability to operate without a body of water. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to ask the question to a hedgehog, who is not the world's largest predator, whose origins are entirely based on their instinctive behavior. Therefore, assuming that hedgehogs are the largest of the animal population, it is more likely that they would avoid animals without a spinal cord. Answer: B"

        "Animal cognition . Animals differ widely in many learning and cognitive tasks in ways that reflect their evolutionary history and their instinctual behaviors in natural environments. For example, dogs and rats easily learn to avoid an electric shock from the floor by moving to another part of the experimental chamber when they hear a tone preceding the shock; this is an appropriate response to a dangerous situation. However, hedgehogs fail to learn this avoidance behavior. This might seem to show the hedgehog's inability to learn, but the hedgehog's instinctive reaction to a threat is to curl up into a ball, a response that interferes with possible escape behavior in this situation."
