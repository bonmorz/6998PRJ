        "First, we need to understand what heartworm is. Heartworm is a type of infection caused by bacterial ovulation, which can cause ear infections or rot. Heartworms can infect any species of animals, including dogs, cats, and other small dogs. Therefore, it is likely that, if someone owns a dog or cat, it may have heartworms, which can cause heart failure and possibly life-threatening complications. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, Goofy would not need heartworm prevention. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what heartworm is. Heartworms are a form of parasites that infect the skin, throat, and urinary tract. Next, we need to understand what it means to be HIV-positive. Heartworm is a parasitic roundworm that causes blood poisoning in humans. When it becomes infected, the lungs and heart attack can be fatal. So, when Goofy was a pet, he would probably be exposed to cardiovascular diseases. Generally, this includes heart attacks, which is the most common form of heartworms, but if he was a small animal, he would likely have heart attack. Therefore, Goofy's eligibility for heartworm prevention is highly unlikely and his ability to live in the heart was likely justifiable. Furthermore, since heartworms occur naturally in dogs, it is safe to assume that it was a small animal, but it has not been linked to any diseases or illnesses such as lung cancer. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, his answer is yes. Answer: A",
        "First, it is important to understand that heartworm is a parasitic and harmful disease that can cause serious harm to the body. Next, it is important to understand that if an animal was attacked or bitten by a heartworm, it may have suffered permanent impairments, such as loss of appetite. However, if Goofy were infected by any of these types of disease, it is highly unlikely that he would suffer from heartworm. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine if a pet can be properly protected in case of heartworm. It will likely need to be given some training or veterinary care in preventing heartworm infection. Next, we need to determine whether or not a dog has any health and wellness issues that would warrant prevention. The heartworm disease involves bacterial growth factors that can cause severe infections in the body. Since these organisms are not exposed to bodily marrow-like symptoms, and they are merely a parasite, they do not require prevention. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Goofy is not a pet. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what heartworm is. This is a parasitic term meaning a bacterial infection which can cause damage to the heart if it occurs through bites or scratching or biting externally. Next, we need to see if Goofy was susceptible to the disease. Even though it is a benign illness, heartworm can cause serious or uncontrollable symptoms throughout life, or even if it is treated aggressively. Now, for the second question, we need to consider Goofy's previous exposure to the worm. According to an article in the \"Fiffer Family\", in 2000, Goofy did not receive treatment for heartworm. In fact, his infection became chronic and he could never learn about heartworm's effects until his symptoms improved. Since Goofy did not require physical or physical therapy to address these illnesses, his immune system and heart growth did not improve or require rest while he was ill. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Dirofilaria immitis . Dirofilaria immitis, the heartworm or dog heartworm, is a parasitic roundworm that is spread from host to host through the bites of mosquitoes. The heartworm is a type of filarial worm, a small thread-like worm, that causes dirofilariasis. The definitive host is the dog, but it can also infect cats, wolves, coyotes, jackals, foxes, and other animals, such as ferrets, bears, seals, sea lions and even, under very rare circumstances, humans. The parasite is commonly called \"heartworm\"; however, adults often reside in the pulmonary arterial system (lung arteries), as well as the heart, and a major effect on the health for the animal is a manifestation of damage to the lung vessels and tissues. Occasionally, adult heartworms migrate to the right heart and even the great veins in heavy infections. Heartworm infection may result in serious disease for the host, with death typically as the result of congestive heart failure."
