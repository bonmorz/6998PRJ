        "First, we need to determine if John George Bice's birthplace is in Cornwall. In 1572, John George Bice's father was George III from Cornwall, Cornwall. We had to search for George III's birthplace at a church in the town of St Mary, Cornwall. On Friday, George III's father was in Cornwall, which was six miles south of Bude. So, it's unlikely that we would find a burial place for George III's father, who died in 1705. Therefore, it is unlikely to be possible that John George Bice's birthplace was near Cornwall. In fact, the answer is (B) no, John George Bice's birthplace was in Cornwall. This is unlikely to be the correct answer. The answer is (B) no, based on the description of John George Bice's father's baptism in Cornwall, which would be incorrect. Given these facts, the answer is (B) no, the answer is (B) no, John George Bice's birthplace is not near Cornwall. Answer: A",
        "1. In the preface to the question, we can assume that the question is asking about John George Bice's birthplace. 2. Therefore, we can assume that if we say that John George Bice is living in Cornwall, then we can assume that there are places in Cornwall that John George Bates could have stayed baptized. 3. The correct answer to the question is, \"No, we don't know.\" It is highly unlikely, or that there is a connection between Bice's birth place and Cornwall. 4. Furthermore, we can learn that it is impossible for us to identify the place where John George Bice's birthplace is if we assume that there is some source of information in the name, such as the location of the Cornwall castle or church, or the general information that is available in the Bible. 5. Thus, we can conclude that it is impossible to say if John George Bice's birthplace is near Cornwall. As such, there is no physical evidence supporting the birthplace or death of John George Bice. 6. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, it is not likely, or would not answer the question directly. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who John George Bice was. John George Bice was born in 1602 in a parish called Friday St Mary, Cornwall. We need to trace his birthplace. Next, we need to determine what it meant for Bice to have some other connection to Cornwall. Bice's birthplace is St Mary, Cornwall, which is in the county of Devon and Cornwall. Now that we have seen this, we can decide where John George Bice's birthplace was. Bice was born in Cornwall. Since he died in 1616, we can assume that he lived in Cornwall. Therefore, it is not possible that Bice's birthplace is near Cornwall. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, John George Bice's birthplace is Cornwall. Answer: A",
        "- In 1870, John George Bice, a well known medieval aviator, was the 17th century British born. - In 1870, John George Bice was appointed a British governor and later became known as Sir John George Bice. He served as the heir and protector of Charles Dickens, as well as as the author and director of the Arthur Conan Doyle mysteries. - However, his marriage with his wife, Mary Vaughn, was later known as his father's burial. So, despite the evidence and history surrounding the circumstances of John George Bice's birthplace, it is not certain if his birthplace was or was near Cornwall. - The source of the information given to us is an article from The Old Roman Catholic Church which mentions the marriage of Elizabeth II to a Catholic woman named Mary Vikes. - In this article, the bishop's name is included in a part of the tomb of John George Bice at Exeter, which was believed to be Bice's home. - The bishop himself, Elizabeth II and the clergyman's family resided in Exeter, England. This would mean that George's burial place was located, rather than his parents' place, and therefore, did not match the original place's image. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to consider John George Bice's birthplace. His birthplace was Week St Mary, Cornwall. Now, we need to think about John George Bice's birthplace, Cornwall. It's in Southampton, England, and John George Bice's parents were both people who were born in the 1960s, the age of 25 or later. These are not the same grandparents who were George Bice's uncle. Therefore, we can infer that there was a physical connection between John George Bice's birthplace and Cornwall. Therefore, we can infer that this reference is the primary source of information regarding John George Bice's birthplace. It can be found in a map of Cornwall, which identifies him as George Bice's son, who was born in Devon, Cornwall. Based on this information, we can confirm that John George Bice's birthplace was Week St Mary, Cornwall, around 1574. This means he was born in the 14th century, and this is the correct location for our reasoning for asking about his birthplace. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes, John George Bice's birthplace was near Cornwall. Answer: A"

        "John Rolle (died 1706) . John Rolle was baptised at Week St Mary, Cornwall, on 23 September 1626. He was the son of Andrew Rolle (d. 1628) of Marhayes (anciently \"Marrays, Marrais, Marrys\" etc.) in the parish of Week St Mary in Cornwall, six miles south of Bude, by his wife Grace Roberts. His grandfather was George II Rolle (d. 1573), the second son of the patriarch George Rolle (d. 1552), of Stevenstone, the founder of the Rolle families of Devon and Cornwall. George II Rolle had been left by his father's will the wardship and marriage, which he had purchased from her father, of Margaret Marhayes (or \"Marrays\" etc.), the daughter and sole heir of Edmund Marrys of \"Marrys\", i.e. Marhayes Manor, Week St Mary, Cornwall. The summarised text of his will concerning this bequest is as follows: \"He grants and bequeaths to George, his son, the wardship and marriage of Margaret Marrys, daughter and sole heir to Edmund Marrys, of the parish of St Mary Wyke in the county of Cornwall, in as ample manner as he had of the gift and grant of the said Edmund Marrys, paying yearly to the said Edmund \u00a3 ? during his life\". George II duly married his inherited ward and thereby founded the cadet line of Rolle of Marhayes, which eventually itself became the senior line on the inheritance of Stevenstone and Bicton by Sir John Rolle (d. 1706), KB, the subject of the present article."
