        "To conclude the question, we need to identify what is considered \"intelligent\" and \"intelligent\" to a person. I. The person having a physical disability such as having a long period of physical or physical disability. . Is the person possessing these characteristics incapable of reproduction? Yes, it is. However, it is possible to assume that, given the limitations of the current species, they may not be capable of performing basic human traits such as playing music, breathing, or performing active behaviors. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, these individuals may not be capable of reproducing. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to know what species of fish are capable of reproducing. Next, we need to understand what constitutes parental roles. Sexual reproduction requires both male and female in order to reproduce. Therefore, the question asks whether there are male or female species capable of carrying offspring. Males are obligate organisms that can carry offspring while females are obligate for sex. Next, we need to discuss whether these species are capable of carrying offspring. Males are capable of carrying offspring, while females are incapable of carrying offspring. Therefore, they can be considered incapable of carrying offspring to become an adult. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, these individuals are incapable of breeding and may not carry on producing offspring to become an adult. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a child means to a parent. Infants are biological foetes that reproduce. Next, we need to ask the question, who are some parents? The parent's children are usually people, with whom the child's parents often interact, and are not atypical people. There is no physical difference between these three ages. Therefore, it is likely that this question is related to parenting (and the fact that these individuals are different). Therefore, a child is not capable of reproduction and is not capable of carrying out the functions of parenthood. It is not possible for all parents to reproduce simultaneously (i.e., their children are dependent) on their own children. Answer: I",
        "First, we need to determine whether the individual is capable of reproducing and not capable of parenthood, indicating that the question is question related and has some common knowledge or information. To this end, the best answers are (1), (a) no, I think we can safely say that such behavior is not capable of adulthood. However, since it is possible that parents are incapable of mothering their children, it is possible that they may or may not be capable of parenting their kids. Given the complexity of the question, we can assume that they may not be able to carry on with their parents' desires as they are incapable of childbirth. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "A woman may assume that her husband will give her offspring, for instance. That is correct. So the question should not seem like a lot of stress or demons from a simple topic. However, we know that this is not common knowledge, and we would need to consider additional factors. A person may have a genital or even an atria, such as females. However, there are also other factors and conditions that might make it difficult to adopt a child. Therefore, we need to assess the ability of a girl or man to produce and reproduce reproductively. Specifically, it is a myth that females cannot reproduce without a progs and child. If a woman is not capable of aging, then this is considered a fertility issue that should be addressed before asking for additional resources and information about how a woman's reproductive systems and performance should have been figured out. Therefore, answering the question and weighing up the appropriate factors should be considered a requirement. Answer: A"

        "Evolution of sexual reproduction . Technically the problem above is not that of sexual reproduction but a problem of having a subset of organisms incapable of bearing offspring. Indeed some multicellular organisms (isogamous) engage in sexual reproduction but all members of the species are capable of bearing offspring. The two-fold reproductive disadvantage assumes that males contribute only genes to their offspring and sexual females waste half their reproductive potential on sons.Thus, in this formulation, the principal costs of sex is that males and females must successfully copulate (which almost always involves expending energy to come together through time and space)."
