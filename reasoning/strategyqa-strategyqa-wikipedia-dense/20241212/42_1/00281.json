        "A leap year usually begins on the second Monday, followed by a full week. During a leap year, there is usually a difference between the first Monday and the second Monday in March. This difference is also due to December 31st, which is the only day in the leap year that begins on December 31st. However, March does start on the second Monday, which is a day that begins on December 31st. Hence, the answer to this question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, the following items should be considered as the first part of a question. March is a holiday that means that a leap or leap year is followed by a new year that begins on August 5, which is the beginning day of February. Assuming that the average month of March is 3 months, you would likely think that March would start on this same day of February. However, March starts on June 1, and the average month of February begins on the same day of the week as February starts on July 31st. Since March begins on the same day of the week, it is possible that the two occur simultaneously. Another fact that is not necessarily consistent with the initial time period of the statement is that the common year of 365 days is starting on November 31, which has many days that would start on that same day of the week. However, there are exceptions to the term 'deleven' or 'reject' which are used for all the days of February (the same day of the year), and a similar day would commence on June 31, while a similar day would start on July 22, a different month of February. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what March is. March is a month in the larger year of the year, March is not. March does not begin on February, which is a day that is alternate between April and June. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to identify the date in December 1915, which is the day on which March begins and ends January 29. During the month in December, it starts on February 15th (which is the same day as March, as February is always in the year for February). If March starts on February 15, then the correct date is March 21st, as February has no month-to-week difference. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, we need to know what February is. February is a year beginning on March, when February begins. Secondly, we need to determine if March's beginning is based on the correct day of the week. March's starting date is January 31 and its beginning date is February 14. March's beginning date is February 31. Therefore, it is not correct that March begins on the same day as February during the leap years, since Mart is a day beginning on January 1 and February is only on February 1 (not March 2), while March can start on March. Since March is the following day, March will not start on March, thus there is no difference between March and February. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Common year . The common year of 365 days has 52 weeks and one day, hence a common year always begins and ends on the same day of the week (for example, January 1 and December 31 fell on a Sunday in 2017) and the year following a common year will start on the subsequent day of the week. In common years, February has four weeks, so March will begin on the same day of the week. November will also begin on this day."
