        "First, we need to understand the time division of a markhor. A markhor is a giraffe of a tribe that belongs to the zodiac system, and a markhor, on the other hand, is a sari of time, and is born as a signhor of a tribe of the sun called lhasa. Next, we need to determine the exact time of the birth and the date it takes to give birth. One day, the day before birth, the noon time, the noon time. Assuming that the markhor will give birth three times in a year, it is only reasonable to conclude that a markhor can give birth three times in a single year in the year given the appropriate consideration. Thus, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, a markhor would have two or more ways to determine when the year's time would come. One way is to start with a three-part division or an ascending divider. Since a markhor is an animal that can travel several generations, it may be able to provide a three-time cycle for a couple of hours. Therefore, based on their location, it can accurately predict a number of years in a given year. Now, to answer this question, we need to consider two different methods for measuring childbirth, so it is possible to have the two methods paired together: birth. This process, known as childbirth, involves multiple variations. Birth is generally performed every year based on a number of times the markhor has been horsen. One option is to use different methods for birth. The second option involves utilizing two methods (pregnanation and death): birth. The third method involves using two different measures to determine how the markhor's birth will happen, such as the time a markhor delivers its baby. This method is especially effective for baby and infant births. In fact, the answer is (B) no, a markhor cannot give birth three times in a year. The final answer is (B) no, a markhor cannot give birth three times in a single year. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know about the concept of a markhor's birth. The markhor is a symbol of the gods' birth. It is used for communication between gods and gods. Next, we need to think about the time zone. During the apocalypse, the markhor is surrounded by the ominous symbols of the zodiac, which are typically found during lunar cycles, such as the moon. It is possible that the markhor's birth would occur under the spell of the moon. This is a possibility, although there are still some doubts about this. The birth order can take in multiple years, so it is possible that the markhor would give birth three times without changing the timing of their births. These events would enable the markhor to make a date at the time of birth for the first time and the second time, which gives birth to a baby in a single year. However, according to astrological information, the markhor could give birth three times in a single year. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, a markhor could give birth three times in a single year. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to establish the timing of a child's birth. The first four-months are typically the first in succession and are typically two to three times per year. Now, we need to determine if the markhor is a type of animal in which it is based on a single cycle or individual. It is a different type of animal than a markhor that would allow a child to only give birth at three or four days per year. Next, we need to establish the time difference between three and twelve years. The markhor has a number of different cycles. We can refer to the exact time difference. The astrological calendar is based on the number of days in the day in which the birth occurs. With three years per day, it is a perfect clock. However, due to the astrological calendar, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know the number of births in a year: 7 years. Since a markhor is generally four times a week, there is no time for such a birth. Therefore, if the mother had born three times in each birth, it would mean the mother, for instance, would have no time to give birth to another child. On the other hand, if a markhor gave birth three times in each year, it would have meant no time to give birth to another child. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A"

        "House (astrology) . The Babylonians may have been the first to set out the concept of house division. Specifically, they timed the birth according to three systems of time division: (a) a three-part division of the night into watches, (b) a four-part division of the nychthemeron with respect to sunrise and sunset, and (c) a twelve-part division of the day-time into hours. Babylonian astronomers studied the rising times of the signs and calculated tables of ascensions for their latitude, but it would take better time measurements by the Egyptians and the introduction of the concept of ascendant, around the 2nd century B.C., to give astrological houses their first recognisable structure and meaning, from the perspective of Classical Western astrology."
