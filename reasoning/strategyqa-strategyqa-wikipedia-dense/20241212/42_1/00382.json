        "First, we need to determine the age range of the preschool class. preschool classes are often small groups of adults, children in a school setting, and elementary age students in schools with young children. Next, we need to determine if The Dark Knight is a movie or TV show that is available for sale on video games. The children and parents in a preschool setting typically do not have the same skills as the adults in a primary education setting such as the preschool. During adult years, young people in a primary education setting may not have the same intelligence and knowledge as the adults in the primary education setting. Therefore, based on their adult years, the answers to the question are quite likely to be that the children in a preschool environment were not familiar with the movie, or that they did not know much about the films genre. Therefore, it is not recommended that the game of The Dark Knight be included in a preschool class. It could be more appropriate to teach their intellectual skills or general perspective to the game, although it is important to keep in mind that the movie may not be appropriate for a preschool class.
