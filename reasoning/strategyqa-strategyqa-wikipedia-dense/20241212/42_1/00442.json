        "Firstly, a swan is a flower species. Ideally, a shoebox would have a larger, larger handle than a shoebox. Hence, a swan would not fit a Nike shoebox in a larger, smaller handle. This means that the shoulder strap is too small to fit a swan in. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a swan is. A swan is a species of bird known to be large and slender. Next, we need to consider how small a shoebox would be. A shoebox is designed for the body, and its size determines the size of the shoebox. Now we need to consider how big the swan is. To ensure that the swan is fit correctly, the size of a shoebox must be around 220cm to the back of a swan's front or bottom. Because of this, it is unlikely that the shoebox would fit snugly over the knees of the swan if it were fitted with small cups. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "A swan's body size is about the same as the size of a basketball shoe. Hence, if the swan is bigger than the original bra size, the sizes and features of the bra might not fit. A swan is a very rare species of bird that inhabits the North and South of Africa, and may not live in the area. Therefore, the answer is (A) no, a Nike shoebox or rubber tube would not fit the swan in. Answer: A",
        "First of all, it is important to consider the size of the swan's length to be safe. The swan is a type of bird known for its large, long torso, and high heeled feet. However, for its size, the overall size could be far too small. On the other hand, a swan is a large species of fish that feeds on a lot of the swan's prey, including fish and flies. So, the swan would be expected to be about a year away from surviving in a shoebox. However, since a swan is a type of fish, it might be safe to say that it might not be able to fit in a swan in a shoebox. Thus, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine what a swan is. A swan is a species of bird known as a tiger or elephant native to Africa and Asia. Next, we need to consider how small a Nike shoebox would be. A shoebox is a shoe or plastic cup in an open frame container that has a wide handle and a large handle. The bigger the handle, the better the shoebox would fit. Secondly, the size of a swan's body is can be based on the weight and clothing they have as a result of a swan. As a result, the size of a swan may not be accurate. So, the correct answer to the question is (A) yes, a Nike shoebox would be too small to fit a swan in it. Answer: A"

        "Bra size . If the straps dig into the shoulder, leaving red marks or causing shoulder or neck pain, the bra band is not offering enough support. If breast tissue overflows the bottom of the bra, under the armpit, or over the top edge of the bra cup, the cup size is too small. Loose fabric in the bra cup indicates the cup size is too big. If the underwires poke the breast under the armpit or if the bra's center panel does not lie flat against the sternum, the cup size is too small. If the band rides up the torso at the back, the band size is too big. If it digs into the flesh, causing the flesh to spill over the edges of the band, the band is too small. If the band feels tight, this may be due to the cups being too small; instead of going up in band size a person should try going up in cup size. Similarly a band might feel too loose if the cup is too big. It is possible to test whether a bra band is too tight or too loose by reversing the bra on her torso so that the cups are at the back and then check for fit and comfort. Generally, if the wearer must continually adjust the bra or experiences general discomfort, the bra is a poor fit and she should get a new fitting."
