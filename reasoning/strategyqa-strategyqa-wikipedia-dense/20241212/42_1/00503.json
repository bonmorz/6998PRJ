        "1. Generally speaking, James Bond and Doctor Who series focuses on a series of spy films. The series takes place in an alternate universe involving two fictional characters: the real James Bond and the real Doctor Who. 2. Despite the similarities in their names, the actual differences between the two series is not a fare. 3.
