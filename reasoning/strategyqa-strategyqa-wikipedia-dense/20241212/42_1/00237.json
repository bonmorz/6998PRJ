        "First, we need to consider who 'Frozen' refers to. The book \"The Snow Queen\" is a fictional character made by a fictional character named Elsa who has the powers to change the weather into a color (or the same) using a special tool called the \"balloon\", which is available online. We can easily see what this means. On the other hand, we can see that the 'Frozen' character has some similarities with Snow White, which is a fictional character made by the same name. Next, we need to investigate the character. According to the Wikipedia site, the character \"Elsa\" was created in 1921 by Elton Moore, who is currently living on Mars. The character's name means \"Incend\" and the Wikipedia says \"Yellow Snow\". According to Wikipedia, the character \"Ella\" is the main character in the movie \"The Snow Queen\" who has the powers to change the weather into a color (or the same) using a specially created \"balloon\" and a polo ballon. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, there is a popular Disney character made from living ice. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to determine who is living ice in Disney's animation series. This includes both male and female characters. Next, we need to consider the type of character based on the female character. Male, female is typically created using physical objects, such as snow, ice, or paints. The character, which is commonly known as Frozen, is associated with the male character. Therefore, a female character can be either female or male. This can be based on the male or female characters based on their character or appearance. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "1. First, we need to understand what living ice is. Living ice is a mixture of water or salt that has been applied to a glacier to create snow and water. 2. Next, we need to determine what the question involves. In the context of a movie, a snowdrift is usually a type of snow that can snow from the snow. 3. Now, we need to consider the character of Snow Queen, a character from the Walt Disney movie starring Johanna and Judd in her first movie. She is a member of Disney's Ice Age, who created the ice sculpture \"The Snow Queen\" and also created a large snowfall from frozen water in the film. We know that the snowdrift was used to create the snow ice sculpture in The Snow Queen, and it is not considered a recognizable fictional character in the movie, which is a result of the popularity of the character's 'flaw' film. 4. Eventually, this ice melt was discovered and used in a science fiction movie. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, snowdrift is a popular Disney character who can be modeled for use in movies, such as Snow Queen and The Snow Queen, or the character of Snow Queen in The Snow Queen. Answer: A",
        "In the \"Frozen\" story, the character \"Snow Queen\" is a character that has been created from living ice, which means it is made from ice. In the movie \"Frozen\", it is a young dwarf named Elsa, who is played by Sheri Sekchow. This character was created by Paul Rudolph, one of the main characters in Disney's \"Frozen\". However, the term \"snow\" comes to mean a very small portion of ice, which is not directly affected by snow. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that there is a character made from ice. In fact, no character made from ice has been made from ice. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, there is no Disney character made from living ice. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, we need to understand what a \"popular\" Disney character is. It is the character in \"Frozen,\" called Snow Queen. This character is based on the character of Hans Christian Andersen, who was an actor and writer born in Germany during the 1930s. According to the US state of Washington, there are no official records of the title or characters associated with the character. It is highly unlikely that these characters would exist. The answer is based on those other characters who have known to have had a familiar connection with the character. Answer: A"
