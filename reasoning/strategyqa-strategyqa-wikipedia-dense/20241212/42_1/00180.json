        "1. Monty Python was a British comedian and comedian known for his stage shows in the 1970s and during his show in the 1970s. 2. However, there is no evidence of who's on First, or who wrote Who's on First.

        "First, we need to understand who Monty Python is. Monty Python is a British comedian and actor known for his popular series, Crazy and incestuous Comedy, which was originally released in 1964. Next, we need to investigate what the Who's on First sketch (which I have discovered under Wikipedia) was. As part of its \"The Who's on First\" series, Monty Python recorded a series of sketches and videos, ranging from the laughs to the humor to the jokes. In a humorous and wry way, the Who's on First video, based on Monty Python's \"splash-the-evil-coincidense-through-the-fly\" theme, also had the potential to be a part of the show. The Who's on First sketch was filmed in the late 1960s in the UK, during what the BBC describes as the \"Billboard festival in New York.\" Therefore, based on his musicals, the Who's on First sketch was filmed in 1970s London during the summer of 1961 as well as his own sketches. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) no. Answer: A",
        "(A) is comparing Monty Python's sketches to the Who's on First sketches.

        "Monty Python . Monty Python (also collectively known as The Pythons) were a British surreal comedy group who created their sketch comedy show \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", which first aired on the BBC in 1969. Forty-five episodes were made over four series. The Python phenomenon developed from the television series into something larger in scope and impact, including touring stage shows, films, numerous albums, several books, and musicals. The Pythons' influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles' influence on music. Their sketch show has been referred to as \"not only one of the more enduring icons of 1970s British popular culture, but also an important moment in the evolution of television comedy.\""
