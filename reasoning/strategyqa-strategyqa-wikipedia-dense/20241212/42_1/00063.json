        "Firstly, if we want to count on a jockey's time as well as a long standing record in a horse race, it would have to be a full year. Assuming the jockey had the time to go fast during the month of Eid al-Fitr, the outcome is the time frame from the beginning of the day of Eid al-Fitr. Therefore, the question is based on the correct answer (B) and the correct answer (C) answer to this question. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand if the endpoint of the race is between Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Fitr. Eid al-Fitr is when the first day of Eid is celebrated, while Eid al-Fitr is the last night of the month. Next, we need to determine the dates of the race. Eid al-Fitr is celebrated on the fifth and final day of Ramadan, while Eid al-Fitr is celebrated on the 16th, and Eid al-Fitr is celebrated on the 30th. Therefore, we need to factor in the number of stakes that the horse has been taking. Based on previous experience, it is estimated that the horse has ridden a distance of around 300m, which is a score of 125, but for various horses, especially those on the first side of the fence, the horse could have gained a lot of ground during the race to win this prestigious race. Final answer: (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand the timing and cost of the Triple Crown. Eid al-Fitr is during the month of Ramadan, culminating in Eid al-Fitr, a religious festival that was celebrated across Europe and was celebrated on Saturday. Next, we need to determine how many ends a jockey can perform and compare the end of the Eid al-Fitr ceremony to the Eid al-Fitr endpoints. Eid al-Fitr is the end of April, the month when Muslims celebrate the Yerah in the Quran. Eid al-Fitr falls on April 28, while Eid al-Fitr falls on May 18, which are both ends of the festival. Now, we can answer these questions: if we can match the exact endpoints of Eid al-Fitr (Sunny Day), Eid al-Fitr endstrips (Edyal-Shaw) between Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Fitr, which is not the exact endpoints of Eid al-Fitr. However, this is not likely to happen because Eid al-Fitr is celebrated on the same day. If we compare the two endingpoints, which are Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Fitr, we see that the horse has finished its month of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Fitr comes into play. We can use these information to determine the approximate date that tiee the Eid-Fitr ceremony. Since the year of Ramadan is beginning to end in July, is it likely that the horse would survive the week-long Eid al-Fitr endings. The answer is (B) no, it cannot win the Triple Crown between Eid al-Fitr endstrips. Answer: B",
        "First, let's understand the number of consecutive ends between Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Fitr. Eid al-Fitr is the final day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Since the annual year of celebrations starts on June 11th, the last remaining days are on June 19th. Next, let's consider the two endpoints: Eid al-Fitr and the Triple Crown. Eid al-Fitr is the month and evening of Eid al-Fitr. The two endpoints are 28 and 20th respectively. Therefore, if two horse jockeys are competing in the endpoints, they can win the Triple Crown but don't win the end of the month. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand the meaning of the Triple Crown. Eid al-Fitr is the end of the month of Ramadan, an uprising month between Godwin and the start of Eid. Eid al-Fitr is the final month of Ramadan (also known as Ramadan). This week, it is on the sidelines of the month of Ramadan and celebrates fasting periods during Ramadan. Next, we need to look at the final date of Eid al-Fitr, which is the date of the end of Eid al-Fitr. Eid al-Fitr is on the 2nd of this month. Therefore, if horses can not perform a marathon on Eid al-Fitr during their own calendar day, horses cannot win the Triple crown. Therefore, our answer to the question is (B) not \"can the jockey win the Triple Crown between Eid al-Fitr endpoints between a triple crown\" and a third and fourth time. Therefore, the answer is (B) incorrect. Answer: B"

        "Eid al-Fitr . Eid al-Fitr ( \"\", ) is an important religious holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide that marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting (\"sawm\"). This religious Eid (Muslim religious festival) is the first and only day in the month of Shawwal during which Muslims are not permitted to fast. The holiday celebrates the conclusion of the 29 or 30 days of dawn-to-sunset fasting during the entire month of Ramadan. The day of Eid, therefore, falls on the first day of the month of Shawwal. The date for the start of any lunar Hijri month varies based on when the new moon is sighted by local religious authorities, so the exact day of celebration varies by locality."
