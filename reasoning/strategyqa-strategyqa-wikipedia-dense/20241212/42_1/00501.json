        "First, we need to know what design and architecture of the pyramids. The pyramids were built in Egypt and are shaped like Greek mythology, so they can be seen from places like Earth, Saturn, or Pluto in the modern world. Next, we need to look at the actual shape of the pyramids. The Egyptian pyramids were built before the pyramids were built, which means it was built from ancient Roman architecture to give it a more polished and appealing look. Now, the answer to the question is, yes, the Egyptian pyramids look the same. This is because they are located on Earth and the pyramids are very tall, with a plan to travel across the earth. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, the Egyptian pyramids look the same as they did when new. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, Egyptian pyramids are the largest pyramids built and erected in ancient Egypt. They are known to have impressive symmetry and a similar appearance, although it is important to note that Egyptian pyramids are not often seen from outside as being completed as they are, owing to an irresistible symmetry and symmetry. The pyramids were designed to use elements of the irradiance of light to avoid reflected sunlight or a harmful ultraviolet ray. As a result, the pyramids did not always have a clear or reflective surface as it was a white color, making them more difficult to see. If they had a smoother surface surface, they would have remained shaped to its shape in a way that would allow it to diffuse easily, often leaving it softer than previous structures. However, the symmetry and shape of the pyramids matched the style and appearance of Ancient Egypt's pyramids, and it is important to remember that the pyramids had been built on a base and were not ever seen from the outside. Moreover, they were constructed as a simple structure that did not require an elaborate finish, and with the help of a professional designer, they were often able to create an exquisite and artistic facade. Therefore, the Egyptian pyramids do look different from those found when new, so the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, let's focus on the Egyptian pyramids. Egyptian pyramids were designed in the late 1700s to provide a great view of the area around the pyramids. Next, let's compare the interior and exterior of these pyramids. The pyramids have a special design that reflects the sun's rays and is especially reflective when they are viewed from above. Next, we can consider the history of these pyramids. Before modern architecture, Egyptian pyramids were built with a marble body, and in later times, the pyramids were designed in similar manner. Therefore, they are not the same when looking at the pyramids when new, due to their distinctive and unique styles. Since these pyramids were designed and built in modern architecture, it is possible that they had the same design and look as they did when new. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, Egyptian pyramids look the same from the outside, although they can look the same from inside. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what the pyramids are. The pyramids are made of a layer of molten rock, which is typically found on the outside of their components, in order to create a crystalline structure around which the surrounding materials are preserved. Now, we can compare the pyramids to the Orient Plata pyramid in Rome, the Ancient Roman Empire. The pyramids are structures built to resemble the Sphere of the Sea, which is located at the northern arc of the sphere of the sphere, where it is arced. It is one of the most famous pyramids in the world, and it consists of six pyramids that are capped, stacked, and topped with each pyramid having a slightly different look. After looking at their exterior, we can see that the Pyramids did not exist when new, and so we can compare them. Clearly, the Pyramids were not developed in a modern manner, which helps to avoid doubts about how they look the way they now do. In fact, the pyramids were formed around the time of the pyramid's construction, which was between 268 and 72 BC, and did not exist until around the - 79 - century after the construction of the - 79-century era. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, the Egyptian pyramids did look the same from outside as they did when new. Answer: A",
        "1. The Egyptian pyramids face the same ways as the real pyramids. 2. The actual pyramids are a pyramid complex that consists of pyramids and spires. 3. The pyramids have different faces. Some have a curved appearance, while others have a distinct appearance. 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, the Egyptian pyramids look the same from outside as they did when new. Answer: A"

        "Pyramid . The most famous pyramids are the Egyptian \u2014 huge structures built of brick or stone, some of which are among the world's largest constructions. They are shaped as a reference to the rays of the sun. Most pyramids had a polished, highly reflective white limestone surface, to give them a shining appearance when viewed from a distance. The capstone was usually made of hard stone \u2013 granite or basalt \u2013 and could be plated with gold, silver, or electrum and would also be highly reflective. After 2700 BC, the ancient Egyptians began building pyramids, until around 1700 BC. The first pyramid was erected during the Third Dynasty by the Pharaoh Djoser and his architect Imhotep. This step pyramid consisted of six stacked mastabas. The largest Egyptian pyramids are those at the Giza pyramid complex. The Egyptian sun god Ra, considered the father of all pharaohs, was said to have created himself from a pyramid-shaped mound of earth before creating all other gods."
