        "First, we need to know the facts of the crash in 1955. It is unlikely that United Airlines would have been involved in the crash at all, because it is not a fact. Therefore, we would need to be very wary about the circumstances surrounding the crash, since the only significant factors relating to the crash are: Facts of negligence, including the driver's actions, and the airline's responsibility, the crash's cause and impact on passengers' health and safety. Therefore, the answer is (A) no. The answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine the tragedy of the 1955 Hawaii R6D-1 crash, which took the lives of all 66 passengers. Next, we need to investigate who the driver was. One of the driver landed in a mountain peak, killing all 63 passengers. Next, we need to determine the fate of United Airlines. It was founded by John M. Kraft, a retired aerospace executive from Washington, D.C., in 1876, the oldest modern United States Aircraft carrier flying into the Pacific Ocean, killing all 447 passengers. As a result, after the crash, the worst crash in US Aircraft history has been compared to the worst. During the crash, many passengers on board were not alive, leaving millions with financial injuries. Unlike United Airlines, which was founded in 1932 and operated from 1940 to 59, the United States Aircraft was unable to perform its function because of aircraft failures including an engine in the crash. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand the fate of United Airlines. United Airlines is an American airline that operates its own flights. It was renamed in 1961 as the \"Downfall of Airships\" because of the death of the 1871 Aircraft crash in Hawaii in 1955. Next, we need to consider the circumstances surrounding the crash. The Airships crashed in Hawaii on May 6, 1963, as a pilot landed there before the crash occurred. Considering that United Airlines' passengers were injured and the planes recovered, it could be concluded that United Airlines would have suffered the most amount of damage compared to the crash. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who United Airlines is. United Airlines is the world's largest airliner in terms of cargo planes. Next, we need to ask if the crash occurred in the same year that killed 66 people on 22 March 1955. According to the American Civil Aviation Association, there are no known instances of high-speed airhead crash in history. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, the worst crash in history was a crash in Hawaii which killed 66 people. It was a flying aircraft which crashed into a mountain peak in Hawaii, killing 66 people on it. Secondly, United Airlines did not shoot down during the crash, being only able to fly two planes. Therefore, United Airlines failed to report responsibility. Thirdly, it is likely that this scenario is also true. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, United airlines did not shoot themselves in the worst crash in history. Answer: B"

        "1955 Hawaii R6D-1 crash . The 1955 Hawaii R6D-1 crash was an accident involving a Douglas R6D-1 Liftmaster of the United States Navy which crashed into a mountain peak in Hawaii on 22 March 1955, killing all 66 people on board. At the time, it was the worst crash involving any variant of the Douglas DC-6 airliner the second-worst aviation accident in U.S. history, and one of the worst air accidents anywhere in history, and it equalled the 11 August mid-air collision of two United States Air Force C-119G Flying Boxcars over West Germany and the 6 October United Airlines Flight 409 crash as the deadliest air accident of 1955. It remains the worst air disaster in the history of Hawaii and the deadliest accident involving a heavier-than-air aircraft in the history of United States naval aviation."
