        "The question is asking whether paresthesia is caused by white pigment. To answer this question, we can begin by referring to the term white pigment. White pigment refers to the pigment that is responsible for the loss of a white spot on the skin, which is part of the eyelid skin. Therefore, the answer to the question is no, and paresthesia cannot cause the loss of the pigment of the white spot on the skin. However, the answer is (B) no, parcetics do not cause loss of pigment. Answer: B",
        "First of all, paresthesia is a condition whereby a white pigment reflects back and exposes skin to ultraviolet light to cause a light-sensitive reaction. It\u2019s best to use white pigment or a pigment that causes a light-sensitivity response rather than white pigment or a pigment that does not. Secondly, a white pigment can only produce dark and dark skin tone. There's no need to use any pigment or a pigment to treat paresthesia. Thirdly, paresthesia is a condition where a white pigment reflects back into skin to cause a light-sensitive reaction. However, it doesn't produce a dark or grey-colored skin tone. It does produce a light-sensitive reaction. Therefore, paresthesia is probably a highly uncomfortable sensation in some people due to their skin's pigmentation (which can, according to some, be very bright or yellow, depending on the person). Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what paresthesia is. Paresthesia is a type of skin pain that causes extreme pain caused by skin irritation or the burning of the skin. When paresthesia is caused due to a number of conditions, it means a white pigment (white pigment) may present itself as a white substance. Because it is natural and healthy to have white pigment in your skin, it's extremely unlikely that a white pigment would cause pain. Next, we need to understand what a white pigment is. It is a pigment that has been used to heal skin from other infections and damage it's ability to heal itself. A white pigment can make a person's skin even and more bearable, giving him more control. This is the type of pigment that helps with paresthesia. Therefore, it's unlikely that the answer here is (B) no, paresthesia can not be caused by a white pigment. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand the process of paresthesia. Paresthesia is the process of ableasing the face to the face with a pressure wave or skin riment. This results in a smooth, distended face, which is known as the \"white pigment.\" Secondly, it is important to note that there are some other treatments that can be suggested as an alternative treatment for paresthesia. If you choose this option, we can based on what we know so far. However, it is always a safe course of action and can only be done on account of appropriate factors and not all of the factors mentioned. In addition, paresthesia oftentime occurs when skin begins to surface unevenly and is eventually pulled away from the face. This means that it is best to treat the issue as soon as possible, especially where there is no visible pigment surfacing. Therefore, it is important to see whether paresthesia occurs primarily during a full-body scan or scan or as early as possible. However, there is no indication that this can be caused by any of the above-mentioned conditions. A typical reaction is usually caused by a white pigment, and this is a non-typical phenomenon. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, paresthesia can be caused by a white pigment, depending on several factors such as sensitivity to light, darkness, and natural selection. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, the question is asking about paresthesia. Parcepsis is the swelling of skin caused by damage to an organ or pathogen. The symptoms of paresthesia are generally associated with extreme pain, pain and inflammation. Without a pigment, this would not be possible or even related. Thus, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A"

        "Depigmentation . Depigmentation is the lightening of the skin, or loss of pigment. Depigmentation of the skin can be caused by a number of local and systemic conditions. The pigment loss can be partial (injury to the skin) or complete (caused by vitiligo). It can be temporary (from tinea versicolor) or permanent (from albinism). Most commonly, depigmentation of the skin is linked to people born with vitiligo, which produces differing areas of light and dark skin. These individuals, if they so decided to use a lightning process to even out their skin tone, could apply a topical cream containing the organic compound monobenzone to lessen the remaining pigment. The brand drug incorporating 20% monobenzone is Benoquin, made by ICN."
