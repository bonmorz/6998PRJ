        "First, we need to understand what golden toads are. Golden toads are a nontropical animal that are found in Asia, and the rest of Europe, and thus need to be kept in separate habitats. They do not live on land, and there is no indication or knowledge on how they can survive without them. This is a question that we can answer with a no-confidence statement (see \"how the storks look after themselves\" and/or \"what they need to do to survive\"). Now, to answer this question, we can make some assumptions. It is important to consider the question and whether it would be helpful to a large number of species of toads. Storks can survive at some point on land, but it is unlikely that they would need to survive with them. It is important to note that they do not need anything else except their habitat . The storks do not need to rely on their habitat for food or shelter. Also, sometimes food is scarce at other times of the day, and thus they cannot survive in areas of extreme temperatures. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define what \"toad\" means. Toads are in the order of the tree-peg, not wing or feather. Therefore, we can say, that storks do not need a golden toad to survive. Toads are known for their long and smooth, leathery skin and their smooth surface. Finally, we need to understand what \"safety\" means. Toads are not good thugs. Essentially, what we get is a sterk who doesn't need a golden toad to survive. Instead, storks may need a human being or other animal as a means of protection, such as a tiger or a fox. With this information in mind, we need to consider if we need storks with a tiger or a fox. If we are addressing the question, we need to make it clear that storks don't need a golden toad to survive. So the answer to the question is \"no,\" yes, storks need golden toads to survive. Answer: A",
        "First of all, storks have a motile appearance and generally lack the ability to shed. Next, we know that golden toads are a species of toad that are found in the northern hemisphere. So, their natural environment is very dry. Therefore, they probably do not need any toads in their habitat to survive. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, storks need golden toads to survive. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what storks are. storks are a subfamily of tety, toads, and are the dominant species in the order of bufonidae. Next, we need to consider the habitats of storks. storks are native to areas of temperate forests in Central or Eastern Europe, such as the arctic areas of India, and some parts of the central and eastern Europe. storks are found throughout the world from India to China. The climate and conditions of the storks are influenced by these habitats. Therefore, it is unlikely that a stork would need a golden toad to survive. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, storks do need a golden toad to survive. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, the definition of a stork is that it is a species of animal which does not have a habitat where it can live. Also, it is not commonly observed that storks need golden toads to survive as such. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: A"

        "Frog . The use of the common names \"frog\" and \"toad\" has no taxonomic justification. From a classification perspective, all members of the order Anura are frogs, but only members of the family Bufonidae are considered \"true toads\". The use of the term \"frog\" in common names usually refers to species that are aquatic or semi-aquatic and have smooth, moist skins; the term \"toad\" generally refers to species that are terrestrial with dry, warty skins. There are numerous exceptions to this rule. The European fire-bellied toad (\"Bombina bombina\") has a slightly warty skin and prefers a watery habitat whereas the Panamanian golden frog (\"Atelopus zeteki\") is in the toad family Bufonidae and has a smooth skin."
