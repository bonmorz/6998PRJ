        "First, strawberries are an animal with the known name \"pathriumicum\" which is a common viral infectious disease that occurs in the wild. Next, we need to understand the different kinds of parasites that affect fruits and vegetables. We know that strawberries are sometimes infected by different types of parasites that are typically caught in the bite, such as raccoons and birds. During this time period, worms may grow and grow in the area of their own habitat. Thus, it is important to note that the common knowledge about the species of fruit and vegetables suggests that strawberries may not have worms. Thus, the answer is (B) no, strawberries do not have worms similar to dogs. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to identify the causes of the disease. It is known as Dracunculiasis, caused by mosquitoes and plants that can infect some animals. Next, we need to identify the pathogens that could infect the strawberry. They include fleas, slugs, and mosquitoes, each of which have a negative environmental impact on the animal. In addition, some viruses in the area of reproduction are known to contaminate animals, especially animals. The mosquitoes can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and even death. Therefore, the answer is yes, a strawberry can get worms similar to dogs because they can eat fleas. Answer: A",
        "The first question is about what the strawberry is and what it looks like. A strawberry is a type of fruit, and it is a fruit that is found in Southern Europe, such as Chile, Argentina, and the United Kingdom. The worm is located on the backside of the strawberry, and it has strong skin, hair, and leaves, making it very fertilized. However, strawberries do not usually have the ability to produce worms. As a result, they are resistant to disease and therefore can suffer from no treatment or control. In addition, strawberries contain a lot of food ingredients and do not require a diet of animals. Therefore, they cannot get worms similar to dogs, because they do not contain all of these ingredients. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, strawberries cannot get worms as they do not have the ability to produce any food options. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what it is like to be a strawberry? It's a plant species with the ability to digest salt. Next, we need to understand what worms are. They are worms that are parasites that live in the skin of cats and are the feasiest of all living things. They are a parasite that are primarily transmitted to cats by food intake and external parasitic infections. Also, people in cats are often infected with worms from fentainella, a parasitic disease causing an infection of the skin. So, if a strawberry is infected with worms, they'd be more likely to carry this disease as they are unable to survive on their own. Since the worms carry out the bodily harms and physical harm of eating fruit, they are unlikely to carry out the sexual activities of a strawberry. So, the answer to the question is a better choice than if the answer is a correct answer to the question. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what worms are. Worms are a type of disease that is transmitted to humans by larvae, but not by faunaviruses. It is usually caused by a parasite called telugas, which attacks the reproductive system to infect humans. Next, we need to take stock of what worms are and their specific characteristics. Fermented worms are likely introduced to humans to infected larvae, which have an antigen - immune effect. Therefore, a strawberry is capable of infected eating fruit and destroying their natural predators. This means that there is no chance that the bacteria may transmit worms to its environment. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no, a strawberry cannot get worms. Answer: B"

        "Dracunculiasis . Dracunculiasis, also called Guinea-worm disease (GWD), is an infection by the Guinea worm. A person becomes infected when they drink water that contains water fleas infected with guinea worm larvae. Initially there are no symptoms. About one year later, the female worm forms a painful blister in the skin, usually on a lower limb. Other symptoms at this time may include vomiting and dizziness. The worm then emerges from the skin over the course of a few weeks. During this time, it may be difficult to walk or work. It is very uncommon for the disease to cause death. In humans, the only known cause is \"Dracunculus medinensis\". The worm is about one to two millimeters wide, and an adult female is 60 to 100 centimeters long (males are much shorter at ). Outside humans, the young form can survive up to three weeks, during which they must be eaten by water fleas to continue to develop. The larva inside water fleas may survive up to four months. Thus, for the disease to remain in an area, it must occur each year in humans. A diagnosis of the disease can usually be made based on the signs and symptoms. Prevention is by early diagnosis of the disease followed by keeping the person from putting the wound in drinking water to decrease spread of the parasite. Other efforts include improving access to clean water and otherwise filtering water if it is not clean. Filtering through a cloth is often enough to remove the water fleas. Contaminated drinking water may be treated with a chemical called temefos to kill the larva. There is no medication or vaccine against the disease. The worm may be slowly removed over a few weeks by rolling it over a stick. The ulcers formed by the emerging worm may get infected by bacteria. Pain may continue for months after the worm has been removed. In 2015 there were 22 reported cases of the disease while in 2016 there were 25. This is down from an estimated 3.5 million cases in 1986. In 2016 the disease occurred in three countries, all in Africa, down from 20 countries in the 1980s. It will likely be the first parasitic disease to be globally eradicated. Guinea worm disease has been known since ancient times. The method of removing the worm is described in the Egyptian medical Ebers Papyrus, dating from 1550\u00a0BC. The name dracunculiasis is derived from the Latin \"affliction with little dragons\", while the name \"guinea worm\" appeared after Europeans saw the disease on the Guinea coast of West Africa in the 17th century. Other \"Dracunculus\" species are known to infect various mammals, but do not appear to infect humans. Dracunculiasis is classified as a neglected tropical disease. Because dogs may also become infected, the eradication program is monitoring and treating dogs as well."
