        "Firstly, the 'Gasse' telescope is used for observing objects around the Earth, while the night sky telescope uses a telescope's surface to see the stars and refraction of light. Next, the answer is 'no'. Originally, the night shift telescopes were only developed in the 1980s and was not able to accommodate the demands of the time and space. This is because the time telescopes are designed to perform night-shift tasks, like observing objects in the night. Secondly, the point of mentioning the night sky observatory is not relevant to the answer given. The night sky telescopes are not open to the public at night and require an array of different hours, specifically the time of day. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand the role of space telescopes in the human eye. These are oblongments, which cannot be found by the Earth's atmosphere, so they would not be able to detect dark-shifts in the nighttime. Therefore, the right answer is (B) no. The answer is (B) yes. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what the night shift is. A night shift involves working hours during the day of one night or less. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no, the telescopes in the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex at Goldstone do not work the night shift. The answer is (B) no, they do not work the night shift. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what the night shift is. A night shift is a shift that involves working around the clock and keeping to a fixed schedule. Next, we need to consider the space telescopes at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex. They are built in the deep space physics department and can also work at night, depending on their availability. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. In the case of not working on the night shift, they have the \"Start The Day\" option and the option is not working on the night shift, so they should be reworking their telescopes. The first option has not been the nights shift of the space telescopes. According to the Stargate site, the Stareye data can only be obtained by the Space Telescopes (Scot. Currently, the Stareye image is only available in the sky and can be obtained at the night shift. Therefore, the correct answer is B- yes. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know what the underground space telescopes are at Goldstone. Goldstone is a large, massively-shaped space telescope located about 30 miles away from the earth. Next, we need to understand what it looks like in the photos. It is not equipped to view the stars invisibility, and it is not accurate. Next, we need to consider what the time zones are in the world. It is not uncommon for night-time jobs to be made with a space telescope, and it's highly unlikely that it will work for many hours. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A"

        "Observatory . Space-based observatories are telescopes or other instruments that are located in outer space, many in orbit around the Earth. Space telescopes can be used to observe astronomical objects at wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that cannot penetrate the Earth's atmosphere and are thus impossible to observe using ground-based telescopes. The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays and is partially opaque to infrared radiation so observations in these portions of the electromagnetic spectrum are best carried out from a location above the atmosphere of our planet. Another advantage of space-based telescopes is that, because of their location above the Earth's atmosphere, their images are free from the effects of atmospheric turbulence that plague ground-based observations. As a result, the angular resolution of space telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope is often much smaller than a ground-based telescope with a similar aperture. However, all these advantages do come with a price. Space telescopes are much more expensive to build than ground-based telescopes. Due to their location, space telescopes are also extremely difficult to maintain. The Hubble Space Telescope was serviced by the Space Shuttle while many other space telescopes cannot be serviced at all."
