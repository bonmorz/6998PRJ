        "First, we need to establish who Temujin is. Temujin is known for his longing for the \"Fresh taener\" (the sword), which is used for sword fighting in ancient times, for obtaining powerful skills such as sword-hands. Next, we need to assess Charlemagne's conquests. Charlemagne reigned for 10 years, a great deal during his lifetime. Therefore, we don't know much about Temujin's conquests until we see that Charlemagne fought with sword-hands, as it was viewed as one of the most dangerous actions of a sovereign ruler. As a result, it is not possible for Temujin to be jealous of Charlemagne's conquests. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, it is not possible to tell how Temujin would be jealous of Charlemagne's conquests. Answer: B",

His role was a messenger who defeated Charlemagne in a battle against the King Vlad. Temujin was a key ally who stood by the knights from the Iron Age. Thus, it is possible that Temujin could be jealous of Charlemagne's conquests because he was the most powerful ruler in Roman history, with much influence over his father and the Saxons. Another key difference is that Temujin was the eldest heir to the Iron Age dynasty. When Charlemagne conquered Egypt, the emperor had to take over the throne, a landslide that was immediately destroyed. Therefore, Temujin would be jealous of Charlemagne's conquests. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Temujin would be jealous of Charlemagne's conquests. Answer: B",

Since Temujin is a king from 1068, we can conclude that he would be jealous of Charlemagne's conquests. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, Temujin would be jealous of Charlemagne's conquests. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to identify Charlemagne's conquests. Charlemagne reigned between 1150 and 1156 and was one of the most powerful kings in Roman history. Next, we need to recognize the common traits of Temujin and Charlemagne. Charlemagne was a noble king who fought against the Persians. He was also the heir to the Khenarodaki, the throne of Iran. Now, we need to consider what these qualities refer to. During his reign, Temujin was a very powerful and strong member of a clan known as the Phalician, who captured most of his people. This was to prove he was able to hold a large army and was highly respected in the region. Therefore, in order to be jealous, we need to consider whether he would have been jealous of Charlemagne's conquests.

The striving of Temujin to free his wife became a reason for the campaign against the Mergids. After the defeat of the Mergid, the reputation of Temujin rose rapidly and the leading members of the Khamag Mongol aristocracy enthroned him with title Chinggis Khan (Genghis Khan), as the ruler of Khamag Mongol.
