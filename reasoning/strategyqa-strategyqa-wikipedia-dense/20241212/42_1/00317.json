        "First, we need to know that a jumping spider is a species of spider that is commonly associated with \"duggerizing\" their body. However, it is not generally used in this scenario. As a type of spider, it can be difficult to see or able to see with this kind of eye contact. Also, it is not uncommon for jumping spiders to wear contact lenses, as they will be wearing on their face, chin, or chest to ensure the safety of their eye and nose. If you have some difficulty with wearing contact lenses, there are several ways to be able to see through them. Also, it is easy to see with this type of spider, as it can be difficult to move and keep the eye open throughout the entire time. Also, it can be difficult for some jumping spiders to break out of their natural cage, requiring emergency eye contact strips, especially when jumping through a dome or hiding at a rock or other vulnerable areas. Similarly, if you have difficulty on your own, you may have difficulty in able to view the eye, chin or chest. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, a jumping spider would not need over half a dozen contact lenses. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know what a jumping spider is. A jumping spider is a species of spider that has eight eyes. They have seven fingers and a wide perch, the size and width of which help them hunt prey. Now, we need to understand what a jumping spider is. A jumping spider is a species of spider that has eight fingers and a wide perch, the size and width are both on its face, eyes, and legs. Each eye has one hand, which is the correct hand for a species of spider. Since a jumping spider has four fingers, their maximum size is two, and maximum eye length is between three and five in order to be safe and fight for prey. However, many species of spiders could not be safely trained enough to be capable of having enough eyes. In general, an animal with multiple eyes will only need one eye per animal and no human eyes. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no, the answer is not in question B. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a jumping spider is. A jumping spider is a species of spider that uses its large body to climb and fly to a hidden location in the wild. They have a small jaw that can be easily removed and have a long neck for a better fit. Next, we need to understand what contact lenses are. Contact lenses are commonly used for medical purposes because they are used for insertion and cleaning of blood or glancing fluids. So, if a jumping spider is not equipped with contact lenses, it would be unlikely for them to need too many. Consequently, we need to make an educated guess. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what a jumping spider refers to and what are they typically referred to as. Jumping spiders are found in the world, including subspecies such as the salticidae (flying spiders). They are also known for using bright lights and anti-restantive technology to avoid unwanted contact. This feature is common in spiders like the black-eyed opossum, or white eyed matriline. Second, we need to understand what it is. A jumping spider is a species of predator spider that eats fruit, rather than just avoiding prey. When a jumping spider is caught in the path of prey or prey, it may also have difficulty avoiding contact with humans, as it is not able to see for a long time without glasses or contact with people. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, jumping spiders don't need over half a dozen contact lenses. Answer: B",
        "First, the correct measurement for a jumping spider is 13/16 inches (20mm.) Next, the proper size for a jumping spider is 13. Since they are typically larger than a standard size, they do not require a lot of effort to find the correct size in order to fit the right size. If you are looking at the correct size, weight, height, or angle of the eye in order to get enough to fit the correct size, it is possible that you will need more than two different sizes. However, the correct size for jumping spiders are varying from 12 inches to 12 inches, so the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Spider taxonomy . The family Salticidae, commonly called jumping spiders, have a characteristic cephalothorax shape, as shown in the diagram below. They have eight eyes, two of them very prominent, and excellent vision. Their maximum size is perhaps 13/16 inch (20\u00a0mm), but many species are much smaller than that. The largest North American species such as Phidippus regius, P. octopunctatis, etc., are so heavy bodied that they cannot jump far. The smaller species of jumping spider can jump many times their own body length. They hunt by first getting within range of a prey animal such as a fly, securing a silken \"climbing rope\" to their current perch, and then jumping onto their prey and biting it. Many seem to take unerring aim at the neck of their prey. Should they jump from one twig to another in an attempt to capture prey and miss or get knocked off the second twig by their struggling prey then they are protected from falling by their silken lifeline. At night these spiders usually retreat to a silken \"puptent\" that they construct for their own protection and, when needed, as a place to deposit their eggs. They are frequently seen in sunlit areas on walls, tree trunks, and other such vertical surfaces."
