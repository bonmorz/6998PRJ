        "1. A Yeti is a rat dog. 2. Only rat dogs exist in the human species, and some animal species don't possess any of the necessary prehensile limbs. 3. Therefore, a Yeti would not have prehensile limbs, because that means that it is not likely to have prehensile limbs. 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, a Yeti would be likely to have prehensile limbs. 5. Therefore, a Yeti would not be likely to have prehensile limbs. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to identify a yeti. A Yeti is a type of animals, and have a prehensile tail. Tiedules are a special type of limbs in the eye of the sun. They are also used as an immobilizer to help guide and supplicate the weight of large objects. Tiedules refer to the top of the body for balance and support, while a yeti is an animal and can move swiftly, balancing their balance and positioning around their body. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Step1: A Yeti is a species of herbivore that is known for its ability to have the ability to chew and eat. Step2: Given the size and weight of each leg, a Yeti might only have a prehensile limb for carrying a bite. Step3: It is logical to assume that a Yeti could possibly have prehensile limbs. Step4: Finally, while prehensile limbs are not the only logical means of locomotion for species that use the term, they are a very safe and effective means of transportation for newcomers and their family members. Towards the end of the story, we find that the only method of transport used by Yeti is by cranes and other animals to transport animals through the branches of the tree stump, a term which has been used to describe the movements in which animals use their limbs to push or twist to move during their walks. However, prehensile limbs would not be the only effective means of mobility for yeti species. Thus, the correct answer is (B) no, a Yeti may not have prehensile limbs for carrying a bite or chew. Answer: B",
        "- There are two limbs used by the Yeti as part of their brachial adaptation. - They use their prehensile legs to move down hills and stairwells in order to move from one position to another. - While a Yeti could have just moved away from their prehensile legs from one position to another, it is unlikely that it would have a prehensile tail. - And while it would have been a different experience for the Yeti, it is a common statement that it is a possible means to move around in nature, while even as part of its brachial adaptations, it does not have the prehensile limbs of a Yeti. So, the answer to this question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to consider if the creature's behavior may need to include prehensile limbs to correctly demonstrate its function. In short, a Yeti is a carnivore with just under ten feet of trunk. Another common term for prehensile limbs is brachiation (which involves swinging from tree limb to tree limb, using only their legs) to maintain balance. Additionally, a prehensile limb is a new characteristic for carnivores and other animals. Essentially, an omnivore has two upper, prehensile limbs and a canine with two legs, which they could use for various tasks, including jumping, leaping, and walking. The omnivore's prehensile limbs \u2014 or the prehensile limbs \u2014 are similar to a pedo-cone, meaning there are no limbs that are similar to the one used by human primates. Therefore, while prehensile limbs are important to the survival of a Yeti, they do not necessarily lead to a certain degree of prehensile limbs. Therefore, it is possible that a Yeti may have prehensile limbs as a common feature. However, given the above description, it is unlikely for a Yeti to have prehensile limbs. Therefore, the answer is (A) no. Answer: (A) no. Answer: A"

        "Animal locomotion . \"Brachiation\" (from \"brachium\", Latin for \"arm\"), is a form of arboreal locomotion in which primates swing from tree limb to tree limb using only their arms. During brachiation, the body is alternately supported under each forelimb. This is the primary means of locomotion for the small gibbons and siamangs of southeast Asia. Some New World monkeys such as spider monkeys and muriquis are \"semibrachiators\" and move through the trees with a combination of leaping and brachiation. Some New World species also practice suspensory behaviors by using their prehensile tail, which acts as a fifth grasping hand."
