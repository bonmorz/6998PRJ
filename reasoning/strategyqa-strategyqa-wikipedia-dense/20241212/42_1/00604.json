        "First, we need to understand what the fetlock is. The fetlock is a small erect artery or hand in the ear which is found near the sternum of the equine. Next, we need to consider the color of horseradish. Horseradish can be red, green, white or even charred to accentuate the ear which is visible underneath the fetlock. Therefore, horseradish does not have a fetlock on the underside of the ear. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, horseradish has not had a fetlock in its ear. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a fetlock is. A fetlock is a small or wide-sided shaped body part of a equine fetlock on the underside of the horse or other equine. After we understand a fetlock, we can move to the question. In equines, the fetlock is on either side of their horse or sired, which means the animal can still be stuck firmly on them without harm. However, there are still some species with distinct fetlocks on both sides of the body, which is an important thing for determining whether or not horseradish has a fetlock. Horseradish has a fetlock and the animal must be not a fetlock. Therefore, the answer to the question is either yes or no, for both reasons, it is safe to say that horses have fetlocks on both sides of their body, and horses do not have any of these features at all. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what a fetlock is. A fetlock is a small callous in the fetlock of the fetlock that makes the animal produce or creates sexual desire. It is a device used to make reproduction, usually in the form of horses. Next, we need to understand what horseradish is. Horseradish is a type of protein found in the feet and skin of horses, in order to provide a desirable and satisfying diet. The body of a fetlock is an inner part of the body, which is often derived from milk or fish and used to make beef products such as stevia or a honey or other seed product. The cow or horseradish is used to feed it to its animals for years. Additionally, horses are very well-balanced, in their lower extremities, and they can use large amounts of grazing time or nutrients that were stored during the early stages of the equine's evolution. These traits can be used to make food for humans, such as milk or honey. Next, we need to consider whether horseradish has a fetlock in that it gives out energy and provides nutritionally necessary nutrients. Horseradish contains a large amount of energy and provides a desirable and satisfying level of nutritional content. After some research, it is clear that horseradish does not have a fetlock. It is not entirely true. This is because horseradish is often referred to by animals as a delicacy or \"ga.\" This is not possible because horses use large amounts of energy in order to feed their horses. Answer: C",
        "Firstly, horseradish is a species of herb, with one small fetlock on the underside of its shell. While horseradish is known for its ability to sting, it does not have a fetlock on the underside of its shell. It is more likely to be chewed directly by horses, which can be dangerous for them. Next, the question asks if horseradish has a fetlock on its body or shell, which can be a common complaint for some animals. Therefore, it is safe to say that horseradish has a fetlock on its underside. However, while horseradish has a very small fetlock, it does not have any fetlock at all. Based on the resulting information, it is possible that horseradish may have a fetlock on its underside. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, a fetlock refers to the small bone in the underside of the fetlock in a equin, usually a horse or other animal. In horse medicine, horses produce a fetlock that looks like the fetlock on the underside. The fetlock in horse medicine is about 1.0 cm in diameter. In this case, there are only 12 fetlocks in horse medicine. Answer: B"

        "Ergot (horse anatomy) . The ergot is a small callosity on the underside of the fetlock of a horse or other equine. Some equines have them on all four fetlocks; others have few or no detectable ergots. In horses, the ergot varies from very small to the size of a pea or bean, larger ergots occurring in horses with \"feather\" \u2013 long hairs on the lower legs. In some other equines, the ergot can be as much as in diameter."
