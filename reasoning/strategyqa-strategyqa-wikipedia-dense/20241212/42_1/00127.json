        "First of all, what is the question asking about the Scots? They are a group of English people who speak several different languages, such as English, Spanish, Spanish, and German. Now onto Mary. This name comes from a Latin girl who married King James V of England. It is assumed that Mary, a famous Catholic religious leader in France, was a descendant of King James V of Scotland. She was the mother of King James V of England. So we can assume that they have descent into France from Mary Seton, who was a French-Scottish person. Mary, like James V, was a French-British woman and was from an area of France in Spain. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what Scottish people are. Scottish people are people who live in Scotland and have been in Europe and Spain before moving to Scotland from England in the 14th century. Next, we need to establish what is French. French people are people who are born in France or Spain, who are members of France and Spain, who have been in Europe and Spain before and have moved to Scotland in the 18th century and were born in Scotland. There is a question about which region is Scottish people who are descendent from the English speaking and Spanish speaking regions. They are from Spain and Canada, and are related by name and descent to France. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the Scottish people have been a descendant of Mary, Queen of Scots from Ireland and France, as they did not have any previous formal French or French ancestry connections with other cultures. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to establish the Scottish people's genetic origins. The Scottish people are from French-speaking countries and historically found themselves descending from Mary, Queen of Scots, the daughter of King and Empress of France. Next, we need to understand who France is. France is a French-speaking country that existed during the late 1800s and 1800s. The Scottish people have lived in England and Scotland since the mid 1600s, which means that the Scottish population are mostly Catholics and Irish-Americans. So, what do you mean? First, we need to compare the Scotland population of 1675-1730 with the census of France based on the same evidence. There are records of early Scots who lived in France and the Irish-speaking records between 1903 and 1807. The Scottish census was in 1730-1719, which is dated from 1863-1769. The Scotland Census has indicated that there were at least 13 people at the time of the birth. Now, based on our observation of the Scottish census, this means that they were in Scotland during the mid-1700s and 1830s. Thus, the answer to this question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who the Scottish people were. The Scottish people are the descendants of Mary, Queen of Scots, who was born in Scotland, and who became queen of Scotland after Charles II's assassination. Next, we need to consider the relationship between the Scottish and the French people. In English speaking France, the people are the French, while the Scottish people are the Scots. Now, let's see that Mary is the name of a French princess, and not Mary. Mary is a French monarch, who married the King James V of Scotland, who reigned from 10th Century. Therefore, it is inconceivable that Mary may have been the last person to marry the King and give birth to the French throne. However, she was a French throne, so there is no reason to believe such a myth. Therefore, the answer to the question is - yes, the Scottish people are indeed French and yes, they were descended from Mary. Answer: B",
        "1. What is Scots and Mary are members of? The Scottish people are a religiously and historical group. 2. Are the Scottish people a descendant of the French and Irish people? Yes, they are. 3. Are they from Scotland? Yes, they are from the French and were a sister of the monarch George of France. 4. Is it a group of noble people with ties to the British majority? Yes, they are, they are known for their loyalty, loyalty, and loyalty to their country. 9. Is it important for the Scots or other British people to be recognized and recognized as their descendants? This could mean that they could have led their lives and have been given some guidance in future. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, Scots and Scottish people are part of this group. Answer: A"

        "Mary Seton . Mary Seton was the daughter of George Seton, 6th Lord Seton, and Marie Pieris, a French-born lady-in-waiting to Mary of Guise, the wife of King James V of Scotland. As a child, Mary Seton became a lady-in-waiting to the young Mary, Queen of Scots, along with three other girls of similar age and of a similar standing in Scots society. They were famously known as \"The Four Marys\": she and Mary Beaton, Mary Fleming and Mary Livingston. They were chosen by Marie de Guise, with the exception of Mary Fleming, for their Franco-Scottish parentage. The Four Marys accompanied Queen Mary in France, where she later married the Dauphin, Francis II of France. Mary Seton was the only one of the four not to marry, and continued in service with Mary, in Scotland and during her captivity in England."
