        "First, we need to understand what Marco Polo is. Marco Polo is an Italian trader and trader from Venice who lived during the 13th century. Next, we need to determine the location of the game, Marco Polo. In the game of Marco Polo, players ask for water, but the player with the longest name, Marco Polo, will usually play using his name. The game of Marco Polo has been popularized by some reputable names such as \"The Adventures of Marco Polo,\" and \"The Adventures of the World of Marco Polo.\" Now, we need to determine where Marco Polo's name is heard. Marco Polo is known as the Venetian trader of Venice, which is a region in the Roman Empire, which has many waterways and other lakes, rivers, and rivers. It is in this context that the word \"Vince\" meaning something close to water, is commonly used in the sentence, \"It is a very powerful character,\" that has been referred to as Marco Polo's nickname in films and television shows, and \"The Adventures of the world of Marco Polo\" a common language used by many people to describe their adventures and in the game of Marco Polo. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to establish what Marco Polo's name means. According to the Renaissance movement, Marco Polo is considered a savior in ancient Greece, and used to trade for gold, coins, and coins. Next, we need to establish where Marco Polo's name was originally from. Marco Polo is a Venetian, as well as a pirate, and we can know from the movie The Adventures of Marco Polo that it savagely fought against pirates. Thus, it is possible that Marco Polo's name was shouted near a bridge between Venice and Venice. The answer is yes, Marco Polo's name was shouted near water as in The Adventures of Marco Polo. Answer: A",
        "Most people know that Marco Polo was the god of the sea. In fact, Marco Polo is one of the very famous and famous ships that Marco Polo ruled. Marco Polo was a Italian merchant and shipowner, but not a true Roman emperor. While Marco Polo is known to speak several languages, a common habit is to call him Marco Polo, called the \"Duchess of Arabia.\" Interestingly, Marco Polo is known to be known for his long ties to the Egyptian people, including their involvement with the Egyptian royal family in Egypt's \"Hambush\". Therefore, if you have not heard Marco Polo's name shouted near water, then you may be unknowingly correcting the question. Thus, the correct answer is (B) no, we are not often heard hear Marco Polo's name shouted near water. Answer: B",
        "First, Marco Polo's name is commonly used to represent the Italian trader from 1375-1415. Next, we need to determine if you have heard Marco Polo's name shouted near water. Marco Polo's name is a nickname for a river, which is believed to be commonly heard around rivers. Since Marco Polo was originally a Portuguese trader named after Roman Emperor Justin Ferdinand in his early life, it is likely that Marco Polo's name is frequently spoken about water. Furthermore, Marco Polo's ship was named Marco Polo during his long lifespan, and it had been suggested that Marco Polo's name had been used to evoke the Roman god Michelangel for his use in the World Trade Organization. However, there is no evidence or research showing that Marco Polo's name had heard any echoes of it, and it is highly unlikely that he would have sounded such a phrase while using it in this context. Hence the answer is (A) yes, Marco Polo's name is often used near water. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to establish the historical context of Marco Polo. Marco Polo was a explorer and trader who is well-known for his appearance and sophistication. Next, we need to examine the usage of guns in the battle of Venice. Some people think of guns in water as a weapon, while the word \"gunfire\" (also spelled \"gunfire\" in Italian) describes the fire of \"gunfire\" or \"fireshots\" on water, which can be heard for a few seconds in a case of shooting. Secondly, the implication for Marco Polo's name has to be established by sprang to invent the weapon on water that has been used in warfare, especially when it is used to inflict on a woman or child in a battle. As for which weapon is used in the battle of Venice, we can assume that Marco Polo was known for his arrows, which was often used in battle. Given this information, we can conclude that it is based on a historical context in which Marco Polo's name may be associated with water. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no, not specifically on water. Marco Polo's name may have been inferred from water and not the battle of Venice. Answer: B"

        "Marco Polo (game) . The game shares its name with the 13th-century Italian trader and explorer Marco Polo. Some etymological sources say it was named after him. The game, or at least the wording of the game likely originated from the 1938 movie \"The Adventures of Marco Polo\". In act 1, scene 2, a gondolier is seen paddling through a Venice canal, repeatedly calling out for Marco Polo. (He is eventually found gambling in the apartment of a beautiful woman.). As a Venetian, Marco Polo's association with water would seem logical."
