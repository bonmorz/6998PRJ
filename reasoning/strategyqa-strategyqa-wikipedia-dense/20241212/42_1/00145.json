        "First, we need to understand what the Great Pyramid of Giza's height is. This is a scale that has to be measured with regard to size. Next, let's look at the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza. It is the largest pyramid in the world, the Pyramid of Giza, at a height of around 430 feet. Next, we need to determine who the builder is. The building that the Egyptians were standing on was once a temple of the Ancient Romans, and the Pyramid of Giza's statues are now under the title of the Great Pyramid. The final answer to this question is yes, the Great Pyramid of Giza is about 150 meters tall in the height of the pyramid. Therefore, it is safe to say that the pyramid may not be tall enough to cover the entire base of the pyramid, while some of the structures may fit on a very thin surface such as the base or walls of the pyramid. Given these factors, it can be concluded that the total height of the Great Pyramid of Giza is an average of about 600 feet. This means that the pyramid might not actually be a total of over 300,000 feet for the entire height of the pyramid. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, the Great Pyramid of Giza's base could actually cover the entire pyramid. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand the dimensions of the Great Pyramid of Giza. It has four sides, an height of 440 cubits and an height of 440 cubits. The total height of the pyramid is 2 feet and a foot, an average height of 440 cubits. Additionally, the pyramid has a height of 280 cubits, compared to 600 feet and 430 feet respectively, and is approximately 9 feet wide. Since we know the dimensions of the pyramid, we can determine how long the men would have to do in order to top the pyramid. Hence, the first step would be to weigh down the diameter of the pyramid and determine how much we should weigh and then multiply this amount onto the dimensions of the pyramid. Since the pyramid has a height of 12 feet and a width of 370 feet, that means the length would have to be a bit higher than the diameter of the pyramid. Also, the height of the pyramid would have to be smaller than the size of the total height. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to consider the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza's base. It is 2,100 feet by 2,550 feet. Next, we need to analyze the size of the pyramid. The total dimensions of the pyramid are 1,200 feet (1,280 meters), a total length of 840 feet (3600 meters), and the overall height of the building is 401 feet (120 meters) or 658 feet. To make it easier to gauge the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza's base, we can calculate that 300 feet (302 meters) will be enough for 200 men. Next, we need to determine the weight of each of the pillars or columns. These are all horizontal pillars that were thrown by the pyramid, and their height could be reduced by at least 40 feet (2500 meters), giving an average height of 200 feet (150 meters) at the base of a giant pyramid. These pillars represent the perimeter of the pyramid, which is 285 feet (240 meters) tall, while their vertical dimensions are around 420 feet (385 meters) tall. Thus, the maximum height of the Great Pyramid of Giza at the end is 50 feet (20 meters), the length of its base, and the overall height of its base. However, it is possible that a giant gyratory would have been made at some point in the construction of the pyramid to accommodate all of these weight factors. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, 200 men can end to end within a maximum of 500 feet (10,600 meters). Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know who the Great Pyramid of Giza is. The Great Pyramid of Giza is a pyramid in the shape of a large pyramid extending to 410 feet tall. Next, we need to look at the size of the pyramid - it is between 280 feet to 1,848 feet in diameter. Since these figures are all based on the weight of the giant pyramid, it is not likely to be very high. In addition, the scale of the pyramid means we can't physically measure the height of the pyramid. We've observed the average height of the pyramid at 3:20 x 330 feet, which means we're slightly short of the height of 150 feet. If we look at the scale, we can find that the pyramid of Giza lasted for 440 feet. But if we think that there are enough to cover the giant pyramid without sacrificing the overall height, it would likely not be possible for that number to reach the highest level of the pyramid. The size of the pyramid depends on factors like the number of pyramids and its height. Therefore, it is not possible for the Great Pyramid of Giza's total length to surpass 160 feet in height and reach the height of the pyramid. Thus, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, let's understand the basic requirements of the Great Pyramid of Giza. The pyramid is tall, and is the largest object in the world. Next, we need to determine what other subjects the pyramid is related to. The pyramid is a complex, containing some of the most complex structures and sandstones, stone columns, marble walls, and other structures in ancient history. This information is important because we can now prove that this pyramid was built in ancient Egypt, without detailed information and historical evidence. It can be assumed that there are other sources that have been buried or researched in the midst of building this monument. However, the answer is not accurate or at all reliable. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, 200 men cannot end to end the Great Pyramid of Giza's base. Answer: B"

        "Great Pyramid of Giza . The completed design dimensions, as suggested by Petrie's survey and subsequent studies, are estimated to have originally been 280 Egyptian Royal cubits high by 440 cubits long at each of the four sides of its base. The ratio of the perimeter to height of 1760/280 Egyptian Royal cubits equates to 2\u03c0 to an accuracy of better than 0.05 percent (corresponding to the well-known approximation of \u03c0 as 22/7). Some Egyptologists consider this to have been the result of deliberate design proportion. Verner wrote, \"We can conclude that although the ancient Egyptians could not precisely define the value of \u03c0, in practice they used it\". Petrie, author of \"Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh\" concluded: \"but these relations of areas and of circular ratio are so systematic that we should grant that they were in the builder's design\". Others have argued that the Ancient Egyptians had no concept of pi and would not have thought to encode it in their monuments. They believe that the observed pyramid slope may be based on a simple seked slope choice alone, with no regard to the overall size and proportions of the finished building. In 2013, rolls of papyrus called the Diary of Merer were discovered written by some of those who delivered limestone and other construction materials from Tora to Giza."
