        "First, we need to establish a number of children, Pi, in China in the 1980s. Pi is a term used for Chinese (Municutai-type) children. Finally, we need to figure out the total number of children. Pi had no number of children at all in the 1980s, indicating that there were only 4 children in the world, which included children who had died in the 1980s. Pi had a maximum number of children in the 1980s, while Pi had no number of children in the 1980s. This suggests that there was still no Pi within China, as a small number did not fit the requirement criteria for adequate children. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine whether Pi was a good number for China. Pi is a low-base child, considered a children's number. Now let's consider where the 1980s were located. In 1980s China had 65,783 migrant children and left-behind children. Now, looking at the population, there was 615,971 children living in China and China. The average age in China from 1980 to 1980 was about 25 years old. Now, looking at the number of female births, let's assume that the children were a male and not a female, given their female status. This is the relative number of female births. However, in the 1980s, according to the data of China's Census 2011, only 36,592 of migrant children were considered female. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the current number does not exceed 50. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Xianhai is the largest ethnic group in China and has approximately 25 million children. Pi is the second largest ethnic group in China and has a population of about 1,400 in China since the 1980s. Given the size and age of Pi, it is considered sufficient to be unacceptable number of children in 1980s China. Therefore, they would not need to worry about achieving a larger number of children. Answer: A",
        "The answer to this question is (A) yes, Pi is an adopted Chinese number that originated in the 1980s. Since Pi is a Chinese number, it can be considered a fifai number, since only 201 people made it to China. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, Pi is not acceptable for a number that was not acceptable in the 1980s in China. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, Pi is a popular type of pig-like creature in Chinese culture, which had a variety of colors and patterns. For example, in the 1980s, pigeys adorked their skin with pink, orange, and pink berries. Next, Pi was incorporated into Chinese culture and based on the tradition of pigeon hunting. In China, the number of pigeons were 8861, or 883, based on the number of pigeons in a row. Secondly, Pi is not an acceptable number, especially as Chinese culture is a complex place where there are many cultures who were pigeons. Thus, Pi was not an acceptable number during the 1980s in China. Answer: A"

        "Left-behind children in China . The National Bureau of Statistics of China calculated in 2011 that the number of rural-urban migrants has exceeded 221 million, 16.5% of China\u2019s population. The National Demographic Development Strategy Report published in 2007 expects the number of rural-urban migrants to increase to up to 300 million people over the next 20 years. This increase in rural-urban migration is consistent with an increase in migrant children and left-behind children. The most recent census published by The National Bureau of Statistics of China calculated that there were 65,782,879 migrant children and left-behind children ages 0\u201317 in the year 2015."
