        "Autumn is a popular time of the year for animal pelts, which are made from animals. However, due to extreme seasonality and the need for winter temperatures, pelts are not a good time to harvest. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what autumn is. It's called the time of year when people live and eat. It's the coldest season in the US, and temperatures are usually lower in the winter than in the summer. The temperature ranges from 40 to 80 \u00b0F (32 to 35 \u00b0C). Since the average season is still warm in September, it's safe to say that autumn is a good time to collect bear pelts in the US. Assuming that we're referring to a specific season, we can determine that bear pelts are typically used around summer time - even though the cold temperatures are typically higher in mid-September - even though they often freeze and then dry out in the winter. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, while it's still not a good time to collect bear pelts in the US, it's safe to do so. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, Autumn is a time of year whereas Spring is a time of summer. Now, we know that Autumn is not a new season in the US. Therefore, it is not a good time to collect bear pelts in the US. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, autumn is the onset of the season. There is usually less chance of storms during autumn, so the ideal time to pick up a variety of materials to keep yourself safe and comfortable. Therefore, the answer to the question is a (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, the weather conditions in the US are extremely temperate and drier than they would in the tropics. This means that the seasons are often very cold. Therefore, it is unlikely that a bird would be able to survive in the cold temperatures of the autumn and winter. Furthermore, there are a number of seasons of animals ranging from winter to summer, and they are typically not a very ideal time to collect and store these animals. Therefore, it is the best time to store or store these animals as the winter months are unseasonably cold. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A"

        "Conservation and restoration of fur objects . Pelts are defined as the skin of an animal that still has the hair or fur intact. Animals used for traditional fur objects alternate between a winter and summer coat. The winter coats of animals are normally more desirable because they are thicker and fuller than the summer coats. The pelts are removed from the animal in a process of skinning and fleshing that removes all the tissue from the skin and pelt. The pelts are then cured and tanned to kill bacteria and create a stable material. Pelts are traditionally used to create clothing and home accessories like rugs, they can be mounted to create trophies or taxidermy specimens, or they can be sold and kept as is."
