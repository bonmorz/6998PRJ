        "The Force . Some Force-sensitive characters can derive special, psychic abilities from it, such as telekinesis, mind control, and extrasensory perception. The Force is sometimes referred to in terms of \"dark\" and \"light\" sides, with villains like the Sith drawing on the dark side to act aggressively while the Jedi use the light side for defense and peace. According to Filoni, Lucas believed a character's intentions when using the Force \u2014 their \"willingness or will to be selfless or selfish\" \u2014 is what distinguishes light and dark sides. The Force is also used by characters who are neither Jedi nor Sith, such as Leia Organa and Kylo Ren. Characters throughout the franchise use their Force powers in myriad ways, including Obi-Wan using a \"mind trick\" to undermine a stormtrooper's will, Darth Vader choking subordinates without touching them, Luke Skywalker having a vision of the future, and Kylo Ren stopping blaster fire mid-air. The Force allows \"ghosts\" of some deceased characters to interact with the living, and Obi-Wan's ghost provides Luke Skywalker with guidance at \"critical moments\" in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\". Film and television use of the Force is sometimes accompanied by a sound effect, such as a \"deep rumble\" associated with the dark side or a more high-pitched sound associated with benevolent use."
