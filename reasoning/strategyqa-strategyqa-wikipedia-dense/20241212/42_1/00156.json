        "First, we need to understand what an ostrich is. An ostrich is a breed of bird with a long, narrow and narrow neck. It's built to be tall and large, while an ostrich is a thick and sloping creature with a long tail, which would put it more than a dog's neck on a vertical plane. So, the question asks whether the ostrich can fit into the nest of a swallow. The answer is (B) no, an ostrich cannot fit into the nest of a swallow. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know about the nest of a swallow. An ostrich is a bird that lives in an area where most bird-feeding birds nest. Therefore, an ostrich cannot fit into the nest of a swallow, and the nest is enclosed and the bird cannot pick it up. Next, we need to consider how to spot if an ostrich could fit in the enclosure. This is basically how the bird has been measuring his or her fertility, as a bird lays their eggs in an area where most birds live, such as a carp or a house. We can use a chart or a scale to help track her or his or her weight, but we can't find any indication of whether the ostrich could fit or not fit in the nest. So, the correct answer is (A) no. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to identify the type of bird. An ostrich is a bird that weighs around 16,000 pounds, and a swallow, usually around 25 to 35 pounds. This means that an ostrich cannot fit into a swallow's nest. Now, let's look at the nest of a swallow. The ostrich has an average lifespan of 25 to 25 years, so its body weight is around 80 to 280 pounds per year. It is difficult to understand why an ostrich would need to fit into a swallow nest to get as much food as a chicken. It is impossible for a ostrich to fit into a swallow's nest, even if they are eating a large number of eggs. If the female is close to a feed on eggs, her egg will be too big or too heavy. As such, an ostrich cannot fit into a swallow's nest, because a feeding can not withstand enough pressure to form a solid nest. As a result, it would be impossible to feed an ostrich into the nest, even if they were eating an egg itself. Hence, the correct answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand the nest of a swallow, which is a bird which lays eggs in a nest. Once this information is provided, it can be determined that the birds have a nest nest built by a couple of other animals. Secondly, the answer is (B) no. When the eggs hatch, an ostrich will need to leave her nest behind to nest. This means that she will not be able to lay eggs until she lays her eggs in the nest. So, the question states - can an ostrich fit into the nest of a swallow? Yes, an ostrich could and will fit in the nest of a swallow. It would be great that she remained on the nest long enough and not that the eggs would have to wait to hatch for her to lay. So the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know what is an ostrich. This ostrich is an ostrich. Now, let's start with two issues. An ostrich is a bird that lay eggs, and its eggs are wrapped in white feathers in an egg shell lining its front. Basically, the nest of a bird is a body of dense, opaque, dense layers made up of thin tiger rays, which is covered in a layer of yellow paper. Unlike other birds, an ostrich does not have any feathers on its tail. Another possibility is a large, male ostrich with the same nest shell as the other male ostrich, as an ostrich is much smaller, and they have the same \"wings\" flora and flora. But with such a big wing and a big shell, there are no alternatives. Answer: B"

        "Common ostrich . The female common ostrich lays her fertilised eggs in a single communal nest, a simple pit, deep and wide, scraped in the ground by the male. The dominant female lays her eggs first, and when it is time to cover them for incubation she discards extra eggs from the weaker females, leaving about 20 in most cases. A female common ostrich can distinguish her own eggs from the others in a communal nest. Ostrich eggs are the largest of all eggs, though they are actually the smallest eggs relative to the size of the adult bird \u2014 on average they are long, wide, and weigh , over 20 times the weight of a chicken's egg and only 1 to 4% the size of the female. They are glossy cream-coloured, with thick shells marked by small pits."
