        "Firstly, A Boeing 737 costs $46 million, so the cost-benefits of the film would be around $36 million. So on the cost side, it doesn't necessarily cover that amount. It simply cannot be included in the budget for the film. Therefore, it's not clear if the box office receipts of Wonder Woman are covered by a Boeing 737 cost. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, a Boeing 737 cost was covered by Wonder Woman . Answer: A",
        "First, we need to determine how much money a Boeing 737 cost to produce. Specifically, the estimate for the total cost of the Boeing 737 is $822.9 million. Next, we need to figure out which box office receipts would cover the total cost of the Boeing 737. Given these calculations, we need to determine the cost of the Boeing 737 on a yearly basis. This figure can be found from the movie Unusual, and the production cost of the film. However, due to its reliance on Boeing 737 contracts, the answer is no. Therefore, the answer is (A) no, not the total cost of the Boeing 737 is covered by the value of the Billboard 737. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what a Boeing 737 cost, which is a Boeing 737 in total cost, would be covered by Wonder Woman. Next, let's look at the budget for each movie. When considering costs and revenues, we need to consider if a Boeing 737 cost includes all of these. The amount of money the Boeing 737 costed to make this amount in dollars, for example, we see that the 737 cost $229 billion dollars in total, which we need to calculate. We also know that the $29 billion dollars paid for the Boeing 737 on February 16, 2017 is the amount in total for a single movie (including the cost of a single movie). Furthermore, if we consider the cost of the production of Wonder Woman (2017 movie), we can see that the cost of the plane and the amount of box office receipts was not included in the total cost. The movie and its overall budget required the Boeing 737 to cover the cost of $222 billion and have no prior relationship or other expenses with the cost of the plane. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to determine whether the cost of a Boeing 737 is covered by the box office receipts of Wonder Woman. First, we need to determine whether the cost of a Boeing 737 is covered by its box office receipts. According to the estimated cost of a Boeing 737 in the US, the box office receipts for the film exceed the movie\u2019s total cost. In contrast, the movie\u2019s total cost was estimated to be approximately $107 million. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, because the question is asking about the cost of a Boeing 737. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a Boeing 737 is. A Boeing 737 can be bought at a price of around $5 million, with additional expenses such as \"driving costs\" including fuel, wing charges, and fuel expenses. Next, we need to consider the cost of the movie Wonder Woman: Answer (B) The movie itself, while a $1200 million-dollar movie would have cost of $82 million and could therefore have net revenues of around $6 million. It is possible that the movie would be able to sell more money, even though it had been pre-made to sell its production values. Finally, since it could be in the same brand and a different price, we can conclude that a Boeing 737 was in the same category as the movie Wonder Woman: Answer (B) The movie was intended to sell at a profit of about $750,000 in one year, with a cost of over $300 million. In general, it may be possible that the movie could have been able to sell more money than it had worth in its cost, and it would have been able to pay more money than it had bargained for. However, in that case, the answer is (B) no, as the movie has been billed as a commercial investment. Answer: B"
