        "Pledge of Allegiance (United States) . One objection is that a democratic republic built on freedom of dissent should not require its citizens to pledge allegiance to it, and that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right to refrain from speaking or standing, which itself is also a form of speech in the context of the ritual of pledging allegiance.

Another criticism is that a government requiring or promoting the phrase \"under God\" violates protections against the establishment of religion guaranteed in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment."
