        "First, we need to understand who a Gray Whale is and what it is. A Gray whale is a marine humpless species known as a kelpoek, which is a small, round marine mollusk that produces large, brown, floppy shells and slender, flat head, or head. It was marketed as a green color for its exterior, stating it could be adapted for swimming in a pool or river. Next, we need to understand what an above ground pool is. A below ground pool is generally shaped and generally fitted with a large door and bellhop-like angled roof for the use of an air-conditioned room or any other space. Assuming this is used in an above ground pool, the answer is (B) no, a Gray Whale would not be able to easily fit in an above ground pool. Answer: B",
        "A gray whale is an ocean whale that typically has larger body shapes and larger tail. So, while a large pool can be a great place to live, it would not be able to accommodate a gray whale. An above ground pool is a pool that requires a lot of room. The best area to find an above ground pool is an area where a river or lake is at an angle and a large ocean or lake might be near the top edge of the pool, allowing a large area of water for a gray whale to fit. Additionally, it can be difficult to locate a gray whale when it is not at all surrounded by a pool. It could be a giant black or brown whale, that would not help the gray whale fit easily in the desired balance of gravity. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know who a Gray Whale is. A Gray Whale is a species of sea echinacean that lives in the United States, and it is not commonly listed in the aforementioned region. Hence, the correct answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "One of the most important things a gray whale needs to survive is to not travel around or over water and to get a close touch with its surroundings. Gray whales are small, powerful swimmers and are typically about 6 feet (11 meters). During a swim, an above-ground pool is preferably small enough to handle the weight and water pressure of a large shark. When a gray whale has been swimming in water, it is highly likely that it will not fit in its surroundings if it is not under pressure or if not within the range of 3-4 feet of the water. A gray whale would not fit easily in an above-ground pool because its body is too small for the sized space it is underwater in. Additionally, the size of a gray whale is likely to vary depending on the size of the sized tank or its size. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to establish what a Gray Whale is. Gray Whales are water-breathing and heavily-adapted to survive and thrive in water. Next, we need to know what a underground pool is. An underground pool is a space with several different levels of water that can be heated to the necessary level by just being near a surface or ocean surface. They are also used for fishing and aquatic animals, as well as fish, which are found throughout marine areas. This is especially important because they tend to be more active and dynamic. The overall size and shape of the pool should be considered as well. In addition, it is recommended that the size and shape of the pool be dependent on an external floatation mechanism, which is the type of rafts that form in the water. The optimum shape is typically a horizontal-based pattern, which might include a large deck or an overflow berth that is not able to sustain water pressure. Another factor affecting a gray whale's ability to fit is its body shape, which is unusual for a blue or gray-colored whale. The common size of the pool is wide enough to adequately accommodate the larger size of the whale. It can also create a surface for the other large fins to use, such as the large toes, which might be suitable for larger swimmed whales. Therefore, it is best to consider a flat-filled pool designed for an above-ground pool that has enough room for a gray whale and its body to be comfortably fit in, in order to avoid damaging the body as much as possible, could occur with a gray whale and its raft.

        "Baleen whale . Rorquals use throat pleats to expand their mouths, which allow them to feed more effectively. However, rorquals need to build up water pressure in order to expand their mouths, leading to a lunge-feeding behavior. Lunge-feeding is where a whale rams a bait ball (a swarm of small fish) at high speed. Rorquals generally have streamlined physiques to reduce drag in the water while doing this. Balaenids rely on their huge heads, as opposed to the rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding behavior allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, with the exception of the bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads. The pygmy right whale is easily confused with minke whales because of their similar characteristics, such as their small size, dark gray tops, light gray bottoms, and light eye-patches."
