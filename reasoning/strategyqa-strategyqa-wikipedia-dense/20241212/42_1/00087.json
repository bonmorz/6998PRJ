        "1. We need to identify the role of an abortion in a child's life. Based on medical experience, we can conclude that all the specific roles that an abortion may play have been left to the discretion of the doctor. 2. What may trigger the abortion behavior? The outcome of an abortion based on the circumstances leading up to the birth of the child. 3. What is a pre-birth abortion? An abortion may only be a spontaneous result. 4. What will happen after a pre-ganadol-aversion abortion? Possibly. Considering that an abortion is a spontaneously occurring termination of a baby's life, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand the terms of spontaneous abortion. Spontaneous abortion is the unintended expulsion of a baby embryo or fetus after 37 weeks gestation and in most cases is not spontaneous. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, it is not possible to perform spontaneous abortion. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, lettuce cannot result in spontaneous abortion. Answer: B",
        "A simple question would be: Can lettuce result in spontaneous abortion? This means that the person is stillborn when he reaches 42 weeks (41 days). However, even if the baby does have a pronation, this does not necessarily mean that it will undergo spontaneous abortion. Instead, it is usually used to diagnose fetal and microbiological issues that occur during pregnancy. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this conclusion. In this case, we have found evidence from research that can provide evidence of spontaneous abortions. It is important to note that the answer to the question depends on the results of the investigation as well as the presence of a supportive source of a support system. There is no evidence that a prognostic factor such as fetal development or the ability to identify and treat the mother's condition might be the culprits for spontaneous abortions. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand the question and the facts. In this context, we can infer from the ages of these plants. And so, we can take a more scientific and logical standpoint as to whether or not the fertilization process does indeed produce spontaneous abortions. In fact, the fusion process involves the creation of a new seed in the plant by a new fetus. Next, we need to consider the embryo if this occurs during pregnancy. A fetus is a body part which cannot be grown by the fetus. Therefore, it is not likely that a fetus will survive an exac test. Thus, it is highly unlikely that a fetus and fertilized embryo could form a spontaneous pregnancy. This means that the correct answer is (B) no. Hence, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "A person with a curtidum type of diet includes lean meat, such as lamb, soy, chicken, or beef. The result is the mother 's premature birth' or birth, which is oftentimes accompanied by a spontaneous abortion. One example of this phenomenon is the release of the uterus, where the baby is born. So if the mother is born at the first of her 29 days pregnant, so the embryo is conceived, the embryo or fetus will emerge from the uterus and then the baby goes to the aforementioned hospital. In other cases, the baby 's premature birth' is triggered by a sudden de-birth or spontaneous abortion. The pregnancy or miscarriage occurs while the baby is still pregnant, which means the fetus, or embryo, is then conceived at the last of her 29 days. Another explanation for this is the abortion, which means that the baby is essentially a child. The answer to this question is based on scientific evidence that a spontaneous abortion results in spontaneous births and births of children. Answer: A"

        "Abortion . Spontaneous abortion, also known as miscarriage, is the unintentional expulsion of an embryo or fetus before the 24th week of gestation. A pregnancy that ends before 37 weeks of gestation resulting in a live-born infant is known as a \"premature birth\" or a \"preterm birth\". When a fetus dies in utero after viability, or during delivery, it is usually termed \"stillborn\". Premature births and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap."
