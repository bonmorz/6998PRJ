        "First, we need to define what is the 2020 billionaire. 2020 is the number of billionaires ranked as world's most famous by age, wealth, and wealth, so we can assume that the amount of capital and wealth that everyone knows, including Richard III, would be enough to cover the cost of raising a money account. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the cost is a multiple of around $10 billion. It's unclear whether the amounts may actually account for the amount of money. In fact, it's unlikely that a total of $1.6 billion is associated with a specific billionaire. Therefore, it's highly unlikely for the 2020 billionaire to have an ownership of the entire total and have been involved in a profitable venture. The estimated actual amount for each of these individuals is estimated to be worth at almost $10 billion, so it could certainly be possible for the billionaire to have an ownership of Cambodia. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, it's impossible for the 2020 billionaire to own Cambodia. Answer: A",
        "- Who are the 2020 richest billionaires? There are billionaires and billionaires from China and Indonesia who have a net worth of $20 billion or more. - Cambodia is not currently the wealthiest country in the world and is not financially viable for its population. - The answer is no, there is no Cambodian investment plan or the interest paid to maintain the Chinese dominance of Cambodia. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to establish the highest average price per share in 2020, a $50 billion yearly tax rate of US$1.7 billion. Next, we need to determine the cost of the property for each billionaire, and then find out if the property has enough funds for making a value of such a high proportion of the wealth. Since the cost of land and property are not a large part of the 2020 total, we cannot say that the property is too expensive for 2020 billionaire to own. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, there is no information substanting the answer. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who 2020 billionaire is. The 2020 richest billionaire is the billionaire from China, Indonesia, and China who owns Djarum, a tobacco company headquartered in Cambodia, Thailand. If we understand the question, we can assume that there is no cost associated with buying a luxury item like a luxury item. Next, we need to compare the prices between the world's two richest billionaires. The highest performing economy in Thailand, Thailand, and Singapore, have all accumulated at an estimated $45 billion in assets. Therefore, the estimated amount a luxury item of a luxury item would typically be worth between $45-$250 billion. If we estimate the total value of Cambodia's wealth and the number of current and former billionaires, we can conclude that the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "To answer this question, we need to know about the cost of Cambodia. The cost of Cambodia depends on the type of currency used and the type of property in question. Therefore, it's not viable for an individual to have any property in Cambodia. According to Reuters, investors are now paying $80 million for this luxury piece of property. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"No\". Clearly, there is no way for an individual to have property in Cambodia, and not for the 2020 richest billionaire to own one. Therefore, the answer to the question is that Cambodia would be too expensive if it wasn't necessary. Answer: A"
