        "First, we need to understand who the three digit number is. In the early 1960s, there were 12 countries to Pluto that could be discovered on moon. Next, we need to examine evidence to show whether humans had footprints on the moon. A popular theory to find out whether human footprinting on the moon was authentic or if human footprints were made at all? According to reliable sources, such as Glen Kuban, it is inadmissible to find any footprints on moon in 1960. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest a human being could have footprints on the moon in 1960. Furthermore, if we compare that time to 1986, we can conclude that there were only 19 footprints on the moon in 1960. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, there was not a footprint on the moon in 1960. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what it means to be the moon. In the period from the 1960\u2019s to the 1960's, the moon orbits the sun and is the largest planet in the solar system. These days, only fractional footprints can be seen on the moon. Hence, there are no footprints on the moon in the 1960\u2019s as the moon was so populated. Thus, the correct answer is (A) yes, there were footprints on the moon in 1960. Answer: A",
        "Step 1. What are footprints on the moon? These feet are very small. Step 2. We cannot confirm that humans were footprints on the moon in 1960. However, for the time, we do know that the moon was entirely covered by sunlight; it does not appear any more or appear to have any footprints. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know when the moon was discovered and discovered. It was in a deep, dark valley near Earth from which it was the first earth settlement in the moon. Now, we need to understand the timeline of 1960. Since there was only one footprint on the moon in 1960, it could not be confirmed that there were footprints on it. Therefore, we can see that there were footprints created by human and dinosaurs. Next, we need to understand the history of the moon and their location. It was in the mid-20th century. The moon had three seasons and temperatures in between 4\u20136 degrees Fahrenheit \u2013 temperatures seen above 100 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (12\u201318 degrees C). The temperature of the moon was -45.5 degrees F (45.2\u20136 degrees C). So, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what footprints are and what they are. One type of footprint is a carved statuet of a dead person that is used as a sign for a person of a certain age. This symbol can be a symbol of death, war, or a symbol of love. In the 1960s, there were only eight human footprints - some that were fake, some were genuine. The fossils on the moon surface were not humanly spotted, which is unlikely to have been discovered in those years. However, based on recent scientific research, we can say that footprints were not discovered in 1960. Since there were no footprints, it is impossible to know, but it is possible to do as well because there is no evidence to suggest that there is evidence for the mass of a human footprint. So the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A"

        "Paluxy River . Some of the tracks were fake, carved by locals to sell during the Great Depression. These footprints do not represent the way human footprints would look in mud; they also do not accurately reflect the changes in the way giant humans would walk as a result of their size. Other footprints were genuine tracks, but showed features inconsistent with human footprints. Supporters of the human footprint theory claimed that the tracks showed authentic mud \u201cpush-ups\u201d and that the time period for the human and dinosaur trackways had to be the same as the trails intersected. In 1986, Glen Kuban conducted research on the trackways. He found that most tracks formed a wide \u201cV\u201d at the end and showed grooves in places that were not consistent with those in a human footprint. Kuban determined that the tracks were made by bipedal dinosaurs with three toes. These particular tracks showed the dinosaur walking on the soles of its feet rather than on its toes, as is usually found in tracks. Evidence based in human anatomy also refutes the claim that the footprints are of human origin. The foot length measurements were used to calculate approximate heights of the humans; the pace and stride lengths do not match these calculated heights, making it highly unlikely that the tracks are human in origin. The measurements do fit the known values for bipedal dinosaurs."
