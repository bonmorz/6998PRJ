        "First, what are Polar Bears and Greek myths? Polar bears are a species of animal that were found in the North Atlantic region of the USSR's Northern Hebrides, which is also part of the Greek region of Antioch and Greek mythology. Next, they can be called a marine species and do not live on land or in the ocean. So, the answer is (A) yes, Antarctica is an ancient ancient city, and Ancient Greece is a ancient ancient country which centered on the Mediterranean coast. Therefore, the answer to this question is not such a question as not so. According to science and history, Antarctic glaciers have some overlap with Ancient Greece, which is why they spend less time outside than Antarctica in the years after glaciers have arose. Since this implies that Antarctica is a continent in Asia, Antarctica was not considered in this period as a continent, or continent at the time. However, since Antarctica is located in Europe, Antarctica's Arctic regions, Antarctica, Greece, and Greece are all located in different continents. According to archaeologists, they live in various regions around Greece, such as Antarctica and Greece. Therefore, in choosing Antarctica to refer to Ancient Greece, it is preferring not to refer to Antarctica and Ancient Greece because they are both an entirely different animal species. Given the general historical fact that Antarctica's geographical location was located in the Atlantic region of the Antarctica and the western Greece, it is not the most suitable for this question, as it was not likely to have many different types of animals roam around. The answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we know that the question is asking of an Ancient Greece colony. The colony is centered on Greece, not Antarctica. Next, we know that the bears living in a cold climate have adapted for their specialized hunting habits. They are trained to be at certain lengths and have adapted for different food items including sea ice, saltwater and fish, as well as other prey. Next, we know that the polar bears had been introduced to Antarctica in the early days of the ice age. This means that the bears lived in a climate with a long temperate climate that was not conducive to their hunting practices. Hence, the answer is (B) no, polar bears did not roam around in ancient Greece, except in some places that were secluded in a cold climate. Answer: B",
        "The question assumes that Polar Bears are responsible for pterodactyls, which are a species found primarily in Europe and the ancient Middle East. The answer is no, they did not live in Ancient Greece. Instead, Polar Bears lived in Antarctica, which is an area of northern Europe like Greece where it is also located. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. The answer is (B) no, they did not live in Greece. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, the question is asking what is known about Ancient Greece, ancient times or current day. It is common knowledge that Ancient Greece was a large Roman kingdom in ancient history and was centered around the ancient city of Pompeii. This is not an answer as the question states that Polar bears do not roam around during ancient times or at all in ancient Greece, but rather travel around ancient Greece. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to consider ancient Greece. Ancient Greece is located around the world's central temperate regions. Next, we need to consider if the polar bears were active during ancient times. The polar bear is typically a member of the Arctic, and as such they have a range of ten years around the world and have evolved to live around the continents of the world. Lastly, the polar bear is not a native to ancient Greece and therefore has no opportunity for wild or adventurous exploration. Thus, the answer to this question is (A) yes. Polar bears are found in the Northern, Eastern and South Pacific, Antarctic countries, and the northern sea ice is closer to the Earth's atmosphere than other places, such as the mountains in Greece, the regions in Egypt, or Asia. The answer to the question is (A) yes. Because of this, Antarctic wildlife are not found in the eastern Europe. The question is primarily a question of whether or not Polar bears could have occupied any of the various territories in ancient Greece. It is difficult to answer this question because the questions are very specific and so may be addressed further. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that polar bears would roam around ancient Greece. Answer: A"

        "Polar bear . The polar bear (\"Ursus maritimus\") is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is a large bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear (\"Ursus arctos middendorffi\"). A boar (adult male) weighs around , while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means \"maritime bear\" and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals."
