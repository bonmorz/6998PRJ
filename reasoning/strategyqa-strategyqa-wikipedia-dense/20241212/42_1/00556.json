        "First, we need to consider the date of the death of Methuselah. Methuselah lived 380 years according to Genesis 179, so he lived 450 years longer than Sarah, a year after her death. Therefore, we can conclude that Methuselah lived 354 years before his death, which is 96,319 years. Sarah lived at approximately 860 years according to a passage in Genesis 2023, which is 135 years before her death, making her a 92 year-old man. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, Methuselah lived at least 800 years as long as Sarah, since Methuselah is the oldest known living in the entire world and is believed to have lived even longer than the other three women. Answer: A",
        "First, the term \"em\" is commonly used in Jewish mythology, since it refers to the age of people who live between 100 years and 1,250,000 years after the fall of the Judea. Then, the age of Methuselah is unknown, as Methuselah died at the age of 8 years at the time that Sarah was born and that is the same age that Methuselah's son died at the time. Now, Methuselah's age is about 215 years old and at least the age of 3 in the synchrotronic clock, or he might have been at a greater age than Sarah, even though her age was 158 years old. These date range from 165-years ago, to 165-years in time. So, while Methuselah's age might not have been as high, a simple calculation would suggest that she lived more than 415 years after setting in her life. Based on this information, we know that the exact age of Sarah is inferred from three sources that the modern version of Abraham was believed to have been written in 1265 AD, thus we can assume that the average age of Abraham was roughly 611 years old. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, Methuselah's age was not as high as that of Sarah. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to consider Sarah's age. Sarah had to be 5 years old and died at the age of 5 to live such as it was, or the year she died. Secondly, we need to consider the length of the Earth, and it was also around 365 years. It means that, as a person, it took about 715 years for Sarah and her daughter to live. Now, let's think about how long Methuselah lived and for what Sarah was. The age of Methuselah was only 365 years (the year she died). As a person, there is not much time left to live in her life, as she was not alive as she was today. Therefore, we can conclude that it is possible that Methuselah could have lived at least 800 years as long as Sarah. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to know the age of Methuselah and Sarah. Methuselah lived in 409 BC. Now, let's understand why we assume there were no guarantees about the age of Methuselah and Sarah. They may have been able to do well. Therefore, if we know they were between the age of 5 years and 18 years old, we can conclude that Methuselah died at least 800 years old, either because she died at least 430 years old or 430 years ago. In fact, it is believed that Methuselah died at least 370 years earlier in his lifetime than Sarah, which means that it would take between 500 and 600 years to make up at least the exact age of Methuselah. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what is meant by \"100\": 1,200 years. Next, we need to calculate the length of the length of Sarah's life. According to the biblical story of the Messiah, Abraham lived by 800 years before he died in 966. Next, we need to calculate the long-term lifespan of the Biblical prophet Sarah. On account of the length of Sarah's life, the biblical prophets lived by 1600 years from the present day to 1812. Therefore, it should be mentioned that the length of Sarah's life is roughly 1690 years, or about 50 years. Next, we need to understand the number of years that Sarah lived as a single person. According to the \"Year\" of Sarah, the average lifetime of Abraham's life was around 600 years. Therefore, we can guess that even a single person, like a woman or a man, would live at least 800 years as Sarah lived. Thus, the answer to the question is (A) yes, I can conclude from the story.

        "Methuselah . Some believe that Methuselah's extreme age is the result of an ancient mistranslation that converted \"months\" to \"years\", producing a more credible 969 lunar months, or 78\u00bd years, but the same calculation applied to Enoch would have him fathering Methuselah at the age of 5 using numbers from the Masoretic Text. Donald V. Etz suggested that the Genesis 5 numbers \"might for convenience have all been multiples of 5 or 10\". If the Septuagint numbers are divided by 10, Methuselah's 165 when he fathered his son would be 16.5 years, and the 969 when he died would be 96.9 years."
