        "First, we need to recognize the dates in the calendar in what happens on Friday the 13th. On the 13th, it is always the 13th (of June), which is the 13th of the year. Now, there are no calendar dates in 2015 that are different from other calendars. Therefore, it is still possible that 2015 has more unlucky Fridays than usual. For instance, in 2015, the 13th was celebrated on January 6, not February 13, because December 22 is the month where June 8 is celebrated. Then, the 13th was celebrated on February 19, which is the day that the 13th occurs every year. Therefore, there is a statistically large chance of Friday the 13ths occurring in 2016 and January 7, which can be helpful in considering that there are many more unlucky days than usual. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First of all, the 13th is a date in the week commencing on a Monday (November 13th), which occurs on February 13. Next of all, there is a week called the 13th in the year-end calendar as well as a holiday called Friday the 13th, which begins on a Monday. On the other hand, the 13th was the first day of the year, which occurs on January 13th, which occurs three days later on April 13th, which occurs on May 13. Next, we need to consider the circumstances surrounding Friday the 13th in 2015. We have been surprised to find that there are no such incidents in 2015 or that even as a number of days have already been occurrences, some have been occurrences as early as September 13, 2016, while there were not, and some have been more. The answer is yes, there is more Friday the 13th than usual, which could be a fact of the question (A) being asking. The correct answer is (A) yes, 2015 had more Friday the 13th than usual (A) yes, 2015 had more Friday the 13th than usual (B) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what Friday 13th is. Friday 13th refers to the day on the 13th of the month (Gregory's calendar) and in the Greek mythology. Friday 13th was discovered in the 12th century AD by Alexander the Great. In addition, we know that the Gregorian calendar has been replaced with the Roman calendar, which was previously common in the Middle Incent. Next, we need to have considered the number of Friday 13ths in 2015. Since there is two Friday 13ths each year in the year, we can conclude that there may have been more Friday 13ths on both of those dates in 2015 than in 2016. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, there may be more Friday 13ths than usual in 2015. Answer: A",
        "First of all, we need to know the dates of the April 13, 2014 and the December 13th events. These are the dates when the 13th event occurs, the 13th day of the year. If we recall the year 2015, then this year's dates start in June, with all events beginning in February and December. However, these dates don't change with actual calendar data. It means that when the 13th event occurs, it would happen in the year 2015. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what Friday the 13th is, or the unlucky day in 2017 and its occurrence. Now, we can confirm that it is not Friday the 13th in 2015, in which it is not a very popular festival. Secondly, we need to understand what the unlucky day is in the year 2015 and the common rule of the 13th in 2017 and 2021. This is the 13th of the year which is celebrated in August, August, and April, respectively. Basically, it is a Friday the 13th that occurs every year until the 13th of the year. Next, we need to determine what the 2015 average number is. In 2015 there were 14 days a day (the 14th for every month of the year) and 1 day for the 13th of the year which was not a good day. This means that there are 4 to 5 Fridays in 2015, with 1 being an unlucky day. So, the answer to the question is (B) no, 2015 has more unlucky Fridays than usual. Answer: B"

        "Friday the 13th . Friday the 13th is considered an unlucky day in Western superstition. It occurs when the 13th day of the month in the Gregorian calendar falls on a Friday, which happens at least once every year but can occur up to three times in the same year. In 2017, it occurred twice, on January 13 and October 13. In 2018, it also occurs twice on April 13 and July 13. There will be two Friday the 13ths every year until 2020, where 2021 and 2022 will have just one occurrence, in August and May respectively."
