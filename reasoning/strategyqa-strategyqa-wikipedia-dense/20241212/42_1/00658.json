        "The Ten commandments are the strict, holy law of Jesus Christ, which is located in the Torah. Furthermore, the Torah contains the commandments of Jesus Christ, which are the Torah portions of the bible. The fact that there is a difference between the two means that the Torah is not the part of the bible, which is a separate part of it. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, the Torah is not the part of the bible that is not believed in by the Jewish people. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know the Ten commandments from the bible. The Ten commandments are said to be the \"moments of the Lord Jesus Christ\" and the \"nation of judgments.\" Now, let's assume that the Ten commandments were written down at Mount Sinai, but now it becomes hard to believe in the New Testament book. They do not exist (often in the middle of the ark, with many chapters devoted to specific commandments). The Bible also contains the biblical scroll which has the Ten commandments arranged in alphabetical order according to the order of the Torah scrolls. Therefore, it has been suggested that there are no Ten commandments in the Bible and there are no biblical scrolls, which contradicts the Bible's Torah books. This is just the case, which the biblical Torah books do not contain. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the Ten commandments were not the part of the Bible that Jewish people believe in. Answer: B",
        "- There are five commandments in the bible (the Ten commandments and the Torah). - This is the part of Jewish tradition that is important for the ten commandments. - There are six commandments written about the Jews during the Jewish history period, and most of them have come from the Ten commandments. - There are eight commandments written specifically for Jews, and these are in the text (according to biblical theology). - Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, the Ten commandments were written in the Torah. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to establish who the Ten commandments are. The Ten commandments are the commandments of God, and were written over 10,000 years ago by Rabbi David Gospel. Next, we need to understand whether the Bible itself is in fact authoritatively written. The bible is written out of Moses' portion of the Bible, the commandments he has given, and the Torah chapters. Therefore, the answer is \"yes,\" while the answer is (a) yes. The Ten commandments are the religious commandments of Jesus Christ, not God. Therefore, the answer is (a) no. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what the Ten Commandments are. In the bible, they refer to the commandments of the Lord, God, and His people. Next, we need to understand what Jews believe in. These commands are \"never follow what they say\", the one commandment says. These commands are the forbidden of every Judah, which means there is only one specific commandment, the Ten commandments. Now, we need to analyze the bibles text. Most Jews believe in the commandments of the Bible, but some don't. For instance, they say the Torah is written down by the Great Pharistor, and he's been given a kosher restitution, the Torah is given to the priest and the sacri-od of the Torah. Therefore, the Ten commandments have been written down with the knowledge of Judah and the Torah as a binding covenant, but the Torah's mandate was not fulfilled during any of them. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes, the ten commandments are not the part of the bible that Jewish people do not believe in. Answer: A"

        "Bible . The Torah contains the commandments of God, revealed at Mount Sinai (although there is some debate among traditional scholars as to whether these were all written down at one time, or over a period of time during the 40 years of the wanderings in the desert, while several modern Jewish movements reject the idea of a literal revelation, and critical scholars believe that many of these laws developed later in Jewish history). These commandments provide the basis for Jewish religious law. Tradition states that there are 613 commandments (\"taryag mitzvot\")."
