        "First, Snowdon Mountain is a mountain located in north Nepal. Next, it's important to note that the Snowdon Mountains are not found in England. The Snowdon Mountains are in Japan. Now, we need to determine if Snowdon Mountain is a piece of cake for Tenzing Norgay. Tenzing Norgay was a former national mountaineer who summited the first world's tallest peak on 29 May 1935. He was born and died in 1939 at the age of 49, and Snowdon Mountain is not considered to be a piece of cake, but the height of Snowdon Mountain is high.

        "Firstly, Snowdon Mountain is located north-north of Everest and is the highest mountain in Tibet.

Secondly, the mountains are located at the tip of mountain and not at a height, but were considered fairly large. 10 meters is a size that is considerably larger than Snowdon. Therefore, it is unlikely that Snowdon would be a piece of cake for Norgay despite the scale and importance of Snowdon Mountain. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",

Therefore, Snowdon Mountain would not have the potential to be a piece of cake to Tenzing Norgay's descendants. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who Tenzing Norgay was. Tenzing Norgay was a legendary Sherpa climber and mountaineer. Next, we need to consider the mountain that Norgay, when he was born, was known for his epic journeys and achievements. Mount Everest was a top-flight avalanche in Nepal in 1897.
