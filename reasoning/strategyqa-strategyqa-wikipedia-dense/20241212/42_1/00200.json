        "First, we need to consider Walt Disney's amusement park peers. This includes: Disney's son, Roy, his devoted family, and the company's founder, Walt Disney. His company's biggest name, Disney, had been established in the 1980s in the melbo's, wichlets area, where it was headquartered. Next, we need to consider the Academy Awards Awards. Both the Walt Disney Film and Broadway show were dominated by Oscars, which are very well known to the public. Before any Oscars have been performed at Hollywood, Hollywood awards were performed at the Academy Awards. After Oscars, it was announced that the Disney brand would no longer have been run by Walt Disney. This was not the case, as some of his movies, such as The Lion King and The Lion King, were reformed and continued to produce high-profile and highly successful films. Therefore, it is unlikely for Walt Disney to dominated his mascot peers at the Oscars, especially if he dominated his amusement park peers at the Oscar Awards. The answer to the question is (B) no, he did not dominate his own amusement parks peers at the Academy Awards. Answer: B",
        "First, you need to understand who Disney is and what he does and what he does. Mickey Mouse is the first Disney to be associated with an amusement park. Next, we need to see what the Academy Awards look like. This category includes the films of Mickey, The Walt Disney Company, Lady Bug, and Pirates of the Caribbean. Disney is the creator of many amusement parks that are marketed to child and teen audiences, and they typically give specific awards to them. However, Disney rarely wins and awards, so this may be indicative of his behavior, which is highly likely. He also dominated the awards given by Oscars and other awards, such as the Oscars based on a combination of special awards categories. Based on the facts and background information, the answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what Oscar competition is. Oscars are awarded to anyone who has been nominated in their field. They give the highest honors to their peers, which gives more control and control over the award-winning movies. Next, we need to consider Walt Disney's success in film industry. In the 1980s, Disney dominated at the Oscars for a series of films about famous characters, characters and characters. It is hard to believe that Walt Disney won the award for his work in the film industry. His filmography and creativity made him the perfect movie star. He also embraced modern filmmaking methods, and made animation very interesting. Therefore, we can say that Walt Disney dominated his amusement park peers at the Oscars. So, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Walt Disney was the biggest Hollywood star of the 20th century in business, with a combined total revenue of $50 billion. Since Disney had been a business dynasty during this time, he had dominated the boardwalk industry in the United States, which is home to the Walt Disney Company, the Walt Disney Company. He also dominated the media. One of the attractions he tended to enjoyed a secluded corner would be Epcot at the Epcot Center. To meet this challenge, we need to ask Walt Disney about where he dominated the industry. He was one of many companies that made it easier for people to reach out to anyone at the theme parks on both sides of the road. That is why we must ask him about the number of awards he was awarded. He received 20 in 2010 for his films and has won 5 in the past. So, in the end, Walt Disney dominated the audience, not Disney. His films and the theatre play acted mostly like a lot of other company's heirs. It makes sense that a lot of Disneys businesses were trying to make an impact. Therefore, the answer is (B) that does not answer the question. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, we need to understand what Oscar competition was. Oscars were usually given on Friday evenings and Saturdays, while Oscars were not awarded on Saturday or Sunday. So Disney was dominated by his peers at Hollywood Films and Animations, and then we get to the question about what award winners were. Walt Disney was one of the most popular and popular producers at Disney's films and television production companies. His children were always shown on the movies and starred in many of his own films. His adult children were also popular actors and singers, and many were well known on the show. Since Disney didn't have anything to do with his musical talents, he was more known for his singing and also acted in film theaters. However, he also had a role in films which were well recognized and well-known. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, Walt Disney did supposedly dominated his amusement park peers at Oscar Awards. Answer: A"

        "Walt Disney . The release of \"The Jungle Book\" and \"The Happiest Millionaire\" in 1967 raised the total number of feature films that Disney had been involved in to 81. When \"Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\" was released in 1968, it earned Disney an Academy Award in the Short Subject (Cartoon) category, awarded posthumously. After Disney's death, his studios continued to produce live-action films prolifically but largely abandoned animation until the late 1980s, after which there was what \"The New York Times\" describes as the \"Disney Renaissance\" that began with \"The Little Mermaid\" (1989). Disney's companies continue to produce successful film, television and stage entertainment. Disney's plans for the futuristic city of EPCOT did not come to fruition. After Disney's death, his brother Roy deferred his retirement to take full control of the Disney companies. He changed the focus of the project from a town to an attraction. At the inauguration in 1971, Roy dedicated Walt Disney World to his brother. Walt Disney World expanded with the opening of Epcot Center in 1982; Walt Disney's vision of a functional city was replaced by a park more akin to a permanent world's fair. In 2009, the Walt Disney Family Museum, designed by Disney's daughter Diane and her son Walter E. D. Miller, opened in the Presidio of San Francisco. Thousands of artifacts from Disney's life and career are on display, including numerous awards that he received. In 2014, the Disney theme parks around the world hosted approximately 134 million visitors."
