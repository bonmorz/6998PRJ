        "First, we need to understand what a king-sized mattress is in terms of moving a human body. A king-sized mattress is one of three things a human body can do, including stretching it for free. Now, let's look at the largest crustacean. A large crustacean has an in diameter of up to 481 millimetres. It's not difficult to stretch a human's body's length, but it's not likely to stretch out. Secondly, we can assume that the largest crustacean would fit on a king-sized mattress, which may vary from body size to body size. As a result, it may not stretch out completely on a king-sized mattress. In fact, it's possible that the largest crustacean would not do so. However, it's possible that the largest crustacean would not stretch out on a king-sized mattress, which may make the question impossible to answer. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to determine that the largest crustacean is an asteroid. The large crustacean is known for its wide, spherical body, with long, narrow, and truncated spines. Next, we need to determine the size of a king-size mattress. A king-sized mattress is typically 5.5 by 4 feet (20 by 20 cm). Next, we need to determine the mass of a crustacean. A crustacean is a large, large body of flesh, covered in calcitioxidosporinum, that is compressed by an axial length to the surface. Next, we need to determine the size of a king-sized mattress, because it is a large structure that is often made of dense vegetation. The size of a king-sized mattress is typically measured in terms of the mass of the large crustacean, and the dimensions and density of the mattress will vary from species to species. Therefore, a king-sized mattress is typically 5.5 feet long, while a king-sized mattress typically has a density of less than 0.5. To answer the question, we need to consider what our answer is. We know that in the general definition of a large or large creature, a king-sized mattress is considered to be a large or powerful structure that is very dense, and is not very large. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what a king-sized mattress is. A king-sized mattress is a building with a single bed that stands by on at least two levels, so it can be assumed that the highest level of the mattress is not a full mattress and therefore cannot stretch out completely. Next, we need to consider the mass of the largest crustacean, the greatest size of any animal. It is the largest of the crustaceans, but the smallest of any species that can stretch out on the king-sized mattress. Therefore, the answer is no, the largest crustacean will not stretch out fully on a king-sized mattress. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, the biggest crustacean is an enormous python living in the crust of the world, weighing roughly 2.4-1.9 million years. Secondly, the greatest crustacean of all is the great mauki or giant giants which weighs over 1.4 millimetres in height. Thirdly, the largest crustacean is the largest python living in the world, weighing approximately 4.8 million years. Thirdly, the largest crustacean can weigh a little more than a king-sized mattress. Therefore, it is not a complete certainty that the largest crustacean can stretch out completely on a king-sized mattress, but it is possible to do so. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to know the size of the largest crustacean. Hence, the answer to the question is no. We would need to check the size of the planet. This translates to that the largest crustacean can stretch out completely on a king-sized mattress. Next, we need to consider the size of the earth's crustacean. To measure a large crustacean, consider the size of the surface of the Earth, the height and length of the smallest organisms, and the dimensions of the largest crustacean. We can determine the size of the largest crustacean by looking at the size of its outer limbs and limbs. And, it is important to note that there are no records of these species moving anywhere. The largest crustacean is the largest organism found on Earth, in size. Therefore, it is unlikely that the largest crustacean would stretch out completely on a king-sized mattress. Answer: B"

        "Largest organisms . The largest organisms found on Earth can be determined according to various aspects of an organism's size, such as: mass, volume, area, length, height, or even genome size. Some organisms group together to form a superorganism (such as ants or bees), but such are not classed as single large organisms. The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest structure composed of living entities, stretching , but contains many organisms of many types of species."
