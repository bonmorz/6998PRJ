        "First, we need to understand the history of the presidency of the President of the United States. This would include John Adams, Eisenhower, John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, George Washington, Charles House, John F. Kennedy, and other notable current or former Presidents. Next, we need to understand the history of the United States of America. The United States of America was founded in 1939, and it was the highest-ranking United States in terms of the era of the President from 1939 to 1941. Johnson was known for his long service and accomplishment on the issue, but the time went by quickly and there was no time for Johnson to act as president. The President had no chance of recognizing his service in the political world, and it was not only Johnson who died during the Presidency that made it to the presidency, but the only one who lived through the presidency. There may be time left for Johnson to lead a new era of government, and this is the time period that he was regarded as the last President of the United States. This time period is not associated with the people who served through the presidency, or the times of President Nixon's presidency. This means that while Johnson and Nixon would have been together in the same time period, they might have lived through the presidency of John F. Kennedy's reign, which was during the same time period. In all, this could have saved the presidency and millions of hours of their lives, as they would not have had the time to conduct their work and worked for Presidents. Therefore, it is unlikely that the high school class of 2010 would have lived through the Presidency of Richard Nixon, as he left the presidency a year prior to that. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand who Richard Nixon was. Richard Nixon was born in September 1946. Next, we need to understand what the term presidency of the U.S. President and President of the U.S. was. Richard Nixon and his predecessors became the first two-term President of the United States and the vice president of the United States during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. Therefore, we would need to study whether the senior class was represented by Richard Nixon through the presidency of Richard Nixon. To conclude, as the answer is (B) no, besides the fact that Richard Nixon was not the first vice president of the United States, his appointment could be determined by the presidency. In fact, as a result, the answer to the question is (B) no.",
        "First, we need to determine who Richard Nixon was. There are eight presidents in the United States and both had the highest percentage of living in the same order. Next, we need to compare their years of government service to the time the presidency of Richard Nixon took place. In the year 2010, Richard Nixon was 66 years old, the same age as John F. Kennedy and the first person to receive the presidency's highest polling levels. Currently, there are 18 people who have the oldest living history, George H. W. Bush, who has never received the presidency of Richard Nixon. However, in the year 2010, there were only 21 people. Therefore, it's unlikely that the high school class in 2010 would have lived through the Presidency of Richard Nixon. Answer: B",

        "First, we need to understand what Richard Nixon was. Richard Nixon was a Vice President of the United States from 1932 to 1939. Next, we need to examine what happened during Nixon's first presidency. Richard Nixon was President from 1926 to 1942. Finally, we need to analyze the possible predicament. The high school class that Nixon attended in the 2010 election is called the 2010 Presidency. Nixon was the most famous president in the US and represented many members of the pop culture and community. However, he was not the oldest living vice president at the time. It was John F. Kennedy's first presidency and his reign began with Nixon's second. The high school class was in the forefront of the American political scene and is therefore a very influential place to ask questions about their past. We can therefore estimate that the 2010 Presidency would have had been a different outcome from Nixon's previous one. Answer: B"

        "List of Vice Presidents of the United States by age . On three occasions the oldest living vice president lost this distinction, not by his own death, but due to the nation electing a vice president who was older. John C. Calhoun became the oldest living vice president following the death of Aaron Burr on September 14, 1836, but lost this distinction on March 4, 1837 when Richard M. Johnson was inaugurated. Charles G. Dawes who the oldest living vice president while in office following the death of Thomas R. Marshall on June 1, 1925, lost this distinction on March 4, 1929 when Charles Curtis was inaugurated (Dawes subsequently became the oldest living vice president again when Curtis died in February 1936). More recently, Hubert H. Humphrey, who became the oldest living vice president upon Lyndon B. Johnson's death, ceased being the oldest living when Nelson A. Rockefeller became vice president in December 1974. John Adams, Martin Van Buren, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford also had the distinction of being the oldest living president, as does George H. W. Bush currently."
