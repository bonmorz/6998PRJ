        "Star Trek: The Role Playing Game . The game's depiction of the Klingons, the result of work by science fiction author John M. Ford, differs greatly from later canon. Ford's Klingons not only appear in the supplement \"The Klingons\" for the game, but also in his Star Trek novel \"The Final Reflection\", whose story is told almost entirely from a Klingon perspective. Ford designed his Klingon society to provide a logical basis for the actions and statements of onscreen Klingons in the original TV series, as well as the differing appearance of the Klingons in the original series and those in \"\" (the only movie featuring Klingons to have been released when the novel and game supplement were first published). They are guided by a philosophy expressed in their \"klingonaase\" language as \"komerex tel khesterex\", roughly translated as \"that which is not growing is dying\"; \"komerex\", referring to any structure growing and expanding its control over its surroundings, is also their word for their empire \"(komerex Klingon)\". This leads to a belief that the proper role of species not part of a \"komerex\" is to serve those that are, and the Klingons have subjugated many of these servitor species \"(kuve)\" in their conquests. The philosophy also motivates their actions on a personal scale, with individuals engaging in schemes and intrigues to enhance their personal power and that of their extended family, and generates traditions like starship officers being promoted as a result of assassinating their superiors."
