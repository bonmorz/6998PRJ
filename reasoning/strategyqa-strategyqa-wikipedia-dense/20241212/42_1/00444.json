        "- American Airlines is a large carrier headquartered in United States, a country that has operated for over 230 years. - The airline operates over 66,000 cities, most of its flights scheduled for May 2018. - Its operations have been overseen by the government. - The answer to the question is yes, United Airlines has a perfect operation record of having a high level of customer service. - Final answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what United Airlines is. United Airlines is a major international airline based in the United States, but it is not commonly associated with any specific country or region. This is because many other airlines are also owned by other carriers and operate from the US, and many are independent carriers that operate for large destinations or businesses. Therefore, based on these three points, the answer is (A) yes, United Airlines has a perfect operation record. Answer: A",
        "First, we know who United Airlines is. American Airlines is a major carrier in the United States. Next, we need to understand their operating record. This is a long running tradition of airlines in the USA, and their employees are mostly responsible for the airline's operations. Therefore, if they could have a successful operation record, it would have been low-cost airlines like United Airlines. However, it is possible that the industry would have made it easier for them to operate as a larger international airline than United. Since United Airlines has grown accustomed to competition, we can see that they have some problems as compared to the other airlines. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, there is a need for an accurate test of whether United Airlines has a perfect operation record. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to define what United Airlines is. This is a United Airlines company. Next, we need to look at the operating records of United Airlines. United Airlines is a major airline in the United States. Next, we need to consider the operating record of United Airlines. United Airlines has been in operation since 2002. Next, we need to establish the operation history of United Airlines. United Airlines is an airline that only operates domestic services and provides commercial services. These are just non-permanant operations. Therefore, United Airlines does not have a perfect operating record. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, United Airlines is a publicly funded airline that sells passenger airplanes. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that it can have an operational history that compares with the industry's. Secondly, United Airlines (Alaap) is a highly rated carrier that has been recognized by the US transportation security and air traffic control agency. They have a very low corporate pricing and do not have a physical presence on their aircraft. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that they can have a perfect operation record. Furthermore, the United Airlines airline has never had an operating history, as this is likely an internal company issue, too. Therefore, in order to conclude the answer to the question, we need to consider the following steps: 1. Understand that the relevant information is not directly related to United Airlines. Therefore, it is important to know that if the answer is correct and the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Transportation in the United States . There is no single national flag airline; passenger airlines in the United States have always been privately owned. There are over 200 domestic passenger and cargo airlines and a number of international carriers. The major international carriers of the United States are Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, and United Airlines. Low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines operates few international routes, but has grown its domestic operations to a size comparable to the major international carriers. There is currently no government regulation of ticket pricing, although the federal government retains jurisdiction over aircraft safety, pilot training, and accident investigations (through the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board). The Transportation Security Administration provides security at airports."
