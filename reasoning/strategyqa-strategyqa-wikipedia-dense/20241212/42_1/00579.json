        "Firstly, we need to understand why paypal would be the optimal use of free shipping to pay for drugs. Secondly, it is important to understand what it means to pay for drugs. When paypal is a type of money service, it will be able to give you a much greater amount on an inflated or low-priced basis. However, it would also be untypical to use paypal for drugs deals if it is common to use it. Thirdly, we need to note that paypal does not have the ability to guarantee the delivery of drugs, but it will have a large price range to cover the consequences of taking a pay-for-drugs deal. While it would be unlikely to use paypal for drugs deals, it would still be unusual to use them properly. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, it would be unusual to use paypal for drugs deals. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, it's highly unlikely to use paypal for drug deals. While it's possible to ring around your house and see who pays, or use online services to request payments, it's rare to use paypal for drugs. Secondly, it's not uncommon for anyone to use online services to request payments. Therefore, it's unlikely that it would be unusual to use paypal for drug deals, given the following trumps: 1. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to understand how paypal works. It is a method for collecting and transferring payments to credit card companies, which provides financial support for the person who is going through financial difficulties, resulting in significant financial losses. It also helps people who are looking for a way to pay for a specific transaction or transaction - typically it would help the person who is trying to pay out to the card companies, for instance. Therefore, it would be unusual to use paypal for drug deals because it does not involve a credit card company, as it only gets a small portion of the payment - it is a financial obligation. In order to reach an even wider range of questions, it can be difficult to get to a reputable online shop or shop that does not carry paypal, as it does not provide any financial or other forms of payment to the customers and employees of the sellers. However, it is rare to find an online shop that does provide a financial support service for customers, and even if they do indeed use a payment method that provides financial support. Lastly, it would be unusual to use paypal for drug deals because it is a bank service that does not require payment, unlike other cash transfer methods where the customer pays by credit card company or cash exchanges, which would make it un-possible for those who have lost money or lost income. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, it would be unusual to use paypal for drug deals because it is not unusual to use it. Answer: B",
        "The question states that a \"paypal\" user must agree to pay for money for a purchase or sale of any kind of drugs, especially illicit drugs like cocaine, crack cocaine, and heroin. The user may also provide information about a website where people receive free-to-utilize services or discounts to purchase drugs. Typically, a user of PayPal can receive a free product, including some of his or her favorite drugs, which are legal to purchase, and it is typically made of paper or plastic. On the other hand, it is rare to use a website or app where this process would take place. Therefore, it is unusual to use paypal for drug deals, as in this case, both the buyer and the seller are subject to payment, typically within a transaction, or at a level other than the seller. In this case, for example, an individual would typically receive a free product or discounts for a drug deal only, which could be beneficial to the user. While it might not be unusual to purchase drugs, having been offered a reduced price or discounts can be beneficial in many ways, such as by individuals, for example with some simple steps to using an online portal or app. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what paypal is and is intended for. PayPal is a website that allows consumers to shop for and pay for online purchases and ads online. Next, we need to determine whether a PayPal account would be unusual to use for drug deals. This method is similar to PayPal's payment system, but it requires a separate page for each purchase and does not allow anyone to set up any account accounts or requests. Furthermore, it is customary for a PayPal account to be a dedicated page for the purchase of a product or services, not to have any other methods of processing it. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Public-order crime . In the terms adopted by Schur (1965), drug dealing is now victimless because neither the buyer nor the seller is likely to report it. The consumption of some drugs can damage the health of users and, in some cases, cause death through overdose because substitution or poor quality, although this potential for harm may be operationally indistinct from the potentials for harm associated with other noncriminal behaviors, such as driving a car while tired or over-consumption of healthy foods. Some argue that if drugs were available legally, they would be less harmful (see the drug policy of the Netherlands). When drugs are illegal, the price is higher, and maintaining the habit takes the money that would otherwise be spent on food, shelter, and clothing. The resultant neglect is a contributory factor to the addict's physical deterioration. In Australia, Walker (1991) finds a strong link between substance abuse and crime. In general, making drugs illegal results in an exponential increase in their price so that addicts must indulge in theft, robbery, and burglary to support their habits. Those people who experience those crimes are indirect victims of the drug sale. The need to fund addiction also drives some into distribution where they are more prone to violent attack and murder. These findings are matched elsewhere. Meier and Geis (1997) confirm that drug dealing is an area where victims are third parties who experience harm only indirectly through, say, losses from drug-related crime, and the costs of enforcing drug laws and of treating addiction, and the public health costs for treating illness and disease consequent on the addiction, e.g., HIV infection through using the same needles. In Australia, for example, the National Campaign against Drug Abuse (see Collins & Lapsley 1991) gives a figure of just over $1.2 billion for total costs of the abuse of illicit drugs in Australia in 1988, including treatment of drug-related illness, accidents resulting from drug use/misuse, loss of productivity due to absenteeism, premature death, property crime and damage, and excluding justice system costs. Conklin (1997: 100) reports the cost of illegal drug use in the U.S. in 1989 at $60 billion a year, a 20% increase over the estimate in 1985. The rise in cost to the state can only be met out of tax revenue, but the burden is not shared equally. Income actually spent on drugs is displaced from purchases that would otherwise have generated sales tax and income tax revenue. Similarly, the substantial profits made by the dealers is not taxed. Thus, the citizens who declare income for tax purposes must pay more to offset the cost of non-capture of drug revenue in their society."
