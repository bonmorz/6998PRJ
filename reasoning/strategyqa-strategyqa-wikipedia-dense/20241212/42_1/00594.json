Therefore, even people who have been baptized or given the religious privileges such as ordination or religious school attendance may not be excommunicated from the Catholic Church. 5. Ultimately, the correct answer is (B) no, a martyr saint can not have been excommunicated. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, a martyr is someone who dies in death. A saint can be excommunicated, however not all those who were baptized and received gifts to honour them are baptized. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, there is a martyr saint who has never been excommunicated. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what excommunicated means in the Catholic Church. Excommunication means the violation of the priests' or church's terms, or the devotion of a religious rite or demon worship for veneration. Next, we need to consider whether a saint was a martyr or a saint who was killed or killed. Saints die in accordance with specific Catholic beliefs, but they are not excommunicated because they did not receive a priest's priesthood or are excommunicated. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who a martyr is. A martyr is a person who comes to Christ by performing miracles or other miraculous activities. It is not a mortally hailed event. He is simply a person who dies from death, suffering and so on to have no claim to the title of martyr. So, what is excommunicated? Excommunicated is the conversion of Christians to one or more sinners, which is a practice in the Catholic Church. Another term for \"permissiveness\", in short, is \"encumbrance.\" This means it is only used once by certain members of a certain community to achieve religious and moral goals. Therefore, the answer is (B) yes. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand who a martyr saint is. They are believers in the Church and adhere to the Christian order of belief and the principles of faith. He is a martyr who is often excommunicated. Next, we need to find out who excommunicates. They are only known for a few years, often for their hard work and achievements. In fact, in actuality, they were never known to have experienced a dispense or celebration of their faith. Therefore, based on that information, it can be safely doubted if a martyr saint ever was excommunicated. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A"

        "Excommunication (Catholic Church) . Since excommunication is the forfeiture of the spiritual privileges of ecclesiastical society, all those, but those only, can be excommunicated who, by any right whatsoever, belong to this society. Consequently, excommunication can be inflicted only on baptized and living persons. Although the Church recites against the devil exorcisms in which the word anathema occurs, he cannot be excommunicated, for he in no way belongs to the Church. Among living persons, those who have not been baptized have never been members of the Christian society and therefore cannot be deprived of spiritual benefits to which they have never had a right; in this way, pagans, Mohammedans, and Jews, though outside of the Church, are not excommunicated."
