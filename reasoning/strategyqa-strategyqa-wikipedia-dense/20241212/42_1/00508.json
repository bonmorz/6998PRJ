        "First, we need to consider where San Diego County, California is located. San Diego County is a mountain range in Southern California. Next, we need to consider whether the calico tribe inhabits the area, or who the Salt Lake Sioux Valley people inhabit. A calico tribe can be represented by two names: Salt Lake City and Salt Lake City. Based on these measurements, we can conclude that the calico tribe inhabits San Diego County, California but that there are no other groups of native calicoines near San Diego County. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to establish San Diego County is a state-owned territory in California. San Diego County is located in California's Santa Barbara County region. Next, we need to determine if it is the home of a Shamu. A San Diego Mountain Kingsnake Snake is a rare mountain kingsnake native to the South Coast of the US. It is believed that it is native to California and is native to the Indian and Mexican regions of California. In addition, it is said to be native to California's San Diego County, making the question question (B) no longer relevant. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to determine who San Diego County is. San Diego County is a county in the San Diego Bay region of California. It also contains a pistachian-based region that is commonly known for being extremely dense and rugged in terms of local habitat. Next, we need to identify the local populations of a species called the Shamu. The Shamu are a natural genitalia of the aztecs (S.Lambtherca & S.p. and Sn.C.) that have been known to inhabit San Diego County and surrounding areas to be a subspecies of the Snakes. Since San Diego County has no recorded Shamu calampions, it is unlikely that a Shamu would exist in San Diego County. This might happen, because San Diego County is known for its mountainous landscape and high elevation. This means that a samphia may have existed in that area over time, as well as the fact that there is no surviving evidence to support any evidences of a Shamu in it. Finally, we need to look for records of the aztecs in San Diego County and the surrounding region, where they were found.",
        "Firstly, San Diego County is a county located on the western coast of Europe. It is on the coast of the United States and most other states. Secondly, San Diego County is a tributary of the United States, a city of san diego, in southern California. This area is situated on San Diego, San Diego Mountain, a mountain region in the Alps region near California's Montevideo coast. Therefore, a San Diego kingsnake would have its place in this region. However, there is no evidence to claim that a San Diego County kingsnake has existed in the past, and it is unlikely that it is the San Diego County's home to a Shamu. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, San Diego County is the home of a Shamu. Answer: A",
        "First, San Diego County is located in San Diego County (USA) where the Shamu is a species of mountain kingsnake, which is one of four surviving tributaries of the Santa Maria Mountains in California. Next, San Diego County has a population of primarily mountain kingsnake with 2 species - Palomar Mountain (North America) and Paltamar Mountain (Baisma). Currently, there are more than 5 surviving tributaries of this species, including the aforementioned mountain kingsnake. Therefore, San Diego County is not the home of the Shamu, as the only two surviving tributaries of the mountain kingsnake are the Mountoran Mountains in California and Laguna Niguel and the Laguna Negro Mountains in San Diego County. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer to the question is (A) no, San Diego County is not the home of the a Shamu. Answer: A"

        "San Diego mountain kingsnake . This California endemic occurs in the Santa Monica Mountains (Los Angeles County); Santa Ana Mountains (Orange and Riverside Counties); Santa Rosa Mountains (Riverside County); and Corte Madera, Cuyamaca, Hot Springs, Laguna, and Palomar Mountain (San Diego County)(McGurty 1988; Figure 44). In reality, this snake is probably present on all mountains in San Diego County above 4,000 feet elevation, or which support proper habitat (Hubbs, 2004). Its elevation range extends from near sea level to ca. 1800 m (Palomar Mountain, San Diego County). Two early specimens (SDSNH 9930, USNM 13889) and three post-1960 records (B. McGurty, pers. comm.) from western San Diego County suggest the possibility of native populations of this taxon near the coast. However, the latter records have remained unverified and the former may represent mislabeled specimens or escaped or released pets (B. McGurty, pers. comm.)."
