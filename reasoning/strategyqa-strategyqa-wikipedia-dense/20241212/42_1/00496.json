        "First of all, you need to know what brewing is. Brewing is the process of brewing beer, which is brewing hops, fruits and ews, or water and lagers, beer and other fermenting products. Next, we need to know what time is beer? The month of September is during the year of the brewing process. It takes about 12 months to be brewing, depending on the region. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to know who and what is brewing. We need to know how long it takes for a batch to be produced. This means that we can brew the beer in a calendar year. It would likely be a very short cycle of consuming it. Therefore, we could not know when the last batch will be ready. However, we can guess that it may have been brewing for a different time period. Therefore, we can add this information to the answer given. Answer: A",
        "1. What is brewing beer? It is the process of making a beer. 2. What does it mean? Brew beer is a type of beer that is made from fermented, saline, and carbon dioxide (carbon dioxide if it is boiling), with a base temperature of about -75\u00b0C or below-freezing temperatures. 3. What is the temperature of the beer when it's brewed? The temperature of the beer is -16\u00b0C -23\u00b0F, which is almost 70 degrees celcius. 4. What is the temperature range for beer that is brewed in september. The minimum amount of cooling in the area is 15\u00b0C (-80\u00b0C). As it is a month, it is too cold, and too cold to make a beer in the month of September. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, beer can not be brewed in the month of September. Answer: B",
        "First, it is important to know what brewing means. Brewing means brewing beer or liquor in brewing equipment or equipment. Next, we need to determine if the beer can be brew in the month of September. It is important to note that the month of September is the month that is the most suitable time for brews to be held. Generally, brew begins when the beer is opened up during the day, but since they can be brewed during the winter months, it is important to focus on the winter months (November - December), as it is an ideal time to start brewing a beer. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First of all, you need to understand what brewing is. Brew is a process involving the process of brewing alcohol. The alcohol content of a beer is limited to a small percentage of the total product. Secondly, the temperature of the beer is very low. As a result, temperature in the day leading up to the temperature of the brewery fluctuates around -40\u00b0C. However, this temperature does not always affect the beer's taste. Third, the time of year is often referred to as August or September. These factors are not particularly different from the actual brewery's time, and there are certain specific factors that may affect the beer's taste. Therefore, we can assume that in the months of September and December are cold. Additionally, there are significant variations in the temperature. One can choose to prefer a dark or unfiltered beer for a dark, but bitter or bitter beer. However, the optimal type is most likely to be brewed from a mild beer and not alcohol. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, as beer from start to finish in the month of September cannot be brewed in the month of September due to the temperature difference. Answer: B"

        "Brewing . When a beer has been brewed using a cool fermentation of around , compared to typical warm fermentation temperatures of , then stored (or lagered) for typically several weeks (or months) at temperatures close to freezing point, it is termed a \"lager\". During the lagering or storage phase several flavour components developed during fermentation dissipate, resulting in a \"cleaner\" flavour. Though it is the slow, cool fermentation and cold conditioning (or lagering) that defines the character of lager, the main technical difference is with the yeast generally used, which is \"Saccharomyces pastorianus\". Technical differences include the ability of lager yeast to metabolize melibiose, and the tendency to settle at the bottom of the fermenter (though ales yeasts can also become bottom settling by selection); though these technical differences are not considered by scientists to be influential in the character or flavour of the finished beer, brewers feel otherwise - sometimes cultivating their own yeast strains which may suit their brewing equipment or for a particular purpose, such as brewing beers with a high abv."
