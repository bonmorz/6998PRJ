        "Lactobacillus . Some \"Lactobacillus\" species have been associated with cases of dental caries (cavities). Lactic acid can corrode teeth, and the \"Lactobacillus\" count in saliva has been used as a \"caries test\" for many years. Lactobacilli characteristically cause existing carious lesions to progress, especially those in coronal caries. The issue is, however, complex, as recent studies show probiotics can allow beneficial lactobacilli to populate sites on teeth, preventing streptococcal pathogens from taking hold and inducing dental decay. The scientific research of lactobacilli in relation to oral health is a new field and only a few studies and results have been published. Some studies have provided evidence of certain \"Lactobacilli\" which can be a probiotic for oral health. Some species, but not all, show evidence in defense to dental caries. Due to these studies, there have been applications of incorporating such probiotics in chewing gum and lozenges. There is also evidence of certain \"Lactobacilli\" that are beneficial in the defense of periodontal disease such as gingivitis and periodontitis."
