        "First, we need to understand the type of chemical that occurs when water is cooled and suspended in water, compared to nitric acid, a chemical process typically characterized by the presence of sulfur dioxide, which is necessary to dissolve nitric acid in a chemistry process. And nitric acid is a non-alcoholic component of a chemical reaction. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, let's need to define what nitric acid means. Nitric acid is not a powerful oxidizer or chemical that will dissolve precious metals. However, it does dissolve the nitric acid and can dissolve gold. To answer this question, we would need to understand what the nitric acid is and its ability to dissolve the gold content of gold alloys. The nitric acid used to dissolve gold can dissolve silver, gold, and other non-metallic minerals. Next, we need to determine how much nitric acid can and does not dissolve the Louvre. As such, the nitric acid that is used in the Louvre has a high acidic acid content, so it cannot dissolve the gold content of gold, which will create a problem for one requiring nitric acid treatment. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand how nitric acid is used to dissolve the gold in an alloy. This type of acid is said to not dissolve gold, but it can dissolve nitric acid. Next, we need to determine the specific type of acid that might be used. Nitric acid is commonly used to dissolve gold. After this, we will need to use a calculator based on their specific needs. In general, it is not recommended to try to dissolve nitric acid as it would not dissolve gold. However, we can do so by taking the time and understanding of what this means, and making sure that the test is correct, there are many possible ways of determining if nitric acid can break gold. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what an nitric acid reaction is. Nitro acid is a strong chemical reaction that will only dissolve gold and silver, which is an essential element of modern art. In fact, it is a non-degradable substance, so it cannot break down a gold alloy or nitric acid (for example, copper or gold). To find out why nitric acid does not break the gold alloy, we need to check if the gold is a good idea. This is because nitric acid is typically made into gold if it is boiled for a long time, making it possible to break the gold alloy. Since gold is still in a low temperature, nitric acid can cause the gold to shrink. These conditions can lead to lead to further damage to the gold or nitric acid, making it advisable to stop using nitric acid immediately after harvesting. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, nitric acid can break the gold alloy or nitric acid - gold's natural color, if i were the correct answer. Answer: A",
        "First, the Louvre is a large bronze structure designed in a high-porouse type of decoration. Secondly, it is designed to dissolve heavy metals and non-perish elements from surfaces without melting or condensing. So, it is likely that nitric acid will not dissolve the gold, silver, or other impurities. However, it does dissolve some metals and it could dissolve many, many layers of the Louvre, and create a temporary solution of gold. Thirdly, a chemical reaction can take a long time and it can be difficult to remove any trace elements from the atmosphere of the Louvre, making it unavoidable. Lastly, nitric acid can make it difficult to disburst gold and alloys without damaging it, so it must be kept away from a source that cannot be properly dried. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no nitric acid can dissolve gold, silver or other uneven metals without melting or detaching impurities. Answer: B"

        "Gold parting . Nitric acid, after distillation to increase the acid strength, is capable of dissolving the silver but it will not (by itself) dissolve the gold. However, nitric acid is not able to (fully) extract silver and other impurities from an alloy with a high content of gold. Therefore, one part of scrap gold was typically alloyed with three parts of copper (quartering) before parting with nitric acid. Another method uses Sterling silver instead of copper. One part pure gold is alloyed with three parts Sterling silver (inquarting). The resulting six karat (6K) gold can then be parted with dilute nitric acid (one part 68-70% nitric acid to one part DISTILLED water). With the karat gold this low (6K), and over medium high heat, the dilute nitric acid will dissolve the Sterling silver (and other base metals in the karat gold) starting on the outside surface of the 6K gold alloy, working its way into the gold alloy, forming a honeycomb structure as it works its way into the metals. Since nitric acid will not dissolve gold, nearly pure gold (very close to 99.5% pure) will be left behind after the reaction is complete. After removing the solid gold other elements like silver and copper may be extracted from the liquid. To get the gold to a very high level of purity (999 fine gold) it is sometimes processed further with aqua regia to effectively remove all the impurities."
