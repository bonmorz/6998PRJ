        "Firstly, we need to understand who Augustus was. Augustus is a Roman king who ruled around 1300 to 340 BC. The answer to the question is (A) yes. (B) no, but it's not clear that augustus had been the king's true name. Augustus is known for his short reign and his presence in the Old World during the reign of Ovid during his reign did not imply a real name. However, it can be told that there is a strong connection between Augustus and his true name and his birthdate. A correct answer is (B) yes. Answer: A",
        "1. Before we know if Augustus had actually become emperor, we can assume that his real name was Caesar, Caesar, and not his actual name was Georgeus II. 2. We can determine based on our current information about the rumor that he was married to Ovid and died on 9 March 1824. 3. He was born in the year after the Roman Empire grew up. 4. This is the name of Augustus, who was referred to as the \"real Caesar.\" 5. This can be interpreted as the Latin name of Augustus. 1. Augustus was born on March 1, 1854, and is often known as the emperor. 6. The question assumes that Augustus was actually his real name. 7. If he had finally not been referred to as his actual name, his real name was Caesar - Caesar was known as Caesar's father. 8. It is uncertain how the correct answer is on the basis of our understanding that Augustus was a Roman - Caesar's name, as he was a Christian. 9. By our knowledge, we can conclude that Augustus was his real name. 10. The correct answer is (A) yes, he is the correct answer. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to define who Augustus was. Augustus was born in approximately 311 BC, known to have been the son of Psalma, the wife of Lycan. The Roman Catholic patriarch, Augustus was a Roman emperor who had the military in ancient Greece who ruled over the Roman Empire. Next, we need to check if Augustus's real name is visible. Augustus was a Roman emperor who ruled from 330 BC until 330 BC. Therefore, there is no record that he was his real name. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, Augustus was his real name. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to identify who Augustus is. Augustus was born in the 4th to 12th century AD. He was a Christian king of the Roman Empire in ancient Greece. His actual name is \"Augustus\", meaning in Romanic slang \"amos\" meaning \"the man who was. Next, we can find out if Augustus was actually his real name. In fact, his name was Augustus, not his actual. Since Augustus was a Christian, he would have been considered as an elder, at least minor, rather than a cleft on him, which is odd as there could be no proof for a real name. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Augustus was not necessarily his real name. Answer: B",
        "1. Augustus was the seventh or tenth ruler of Roman Rome, and he was known as a Roman ruler who ruled during the reign of the Iberius XVI. 2. Lastly, we must note that there is no known evidence to suggest his real name existed. 3. Augustus was an Egyptian general known to be dead and buried in Rome and was believed to have been dead from the time of the second and third century BC. 4. According to ancient scholars, Augustus was the son of Claudius, who was also the second to Augustus in the 8th century BCE, and he was killed before the fall of Persia. 5. The earliest known evidence for the name Augustus is that he was buried during the reign of Julius, the Greek emperor, and his brother Julius, who was killed after his son was emperor. 6. Now we need to check his true name. Augustus was the emperor of Rome during the years between 5th and 9th centuries BCE, and he was known to have existed as the name Augustus (Bacius XVI), his brother and allies. While time traces show that Augustus' real name may have been unknown, the fact that his name is known to refer to the name Augustus was not given before his death. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, Augustus' real name was Augustus. Answer: A"

        "Nero Claudius Drusus . Drusus was the youngest son of Livia Drusilla from her marriage to Tiberius Claudius Nero, who was legally declared his father before the couple divorced. Drusus was born between mid-March and mid-April 38 BC, three months after Livia married Augustus on 17 January. Gerhard Radke has proposed the date of March 28 as his most likely birthday, while Lindsay Powell interprets Ovid's \"Fasti\" as indicating a date of 13 January. Rumors arose that Augustus was the child's real father, although this has never been authoritatively proven. Claudius, however, encouraged the rumor during his reign as emperor to create an impression of more direct lineage from Augustus."
