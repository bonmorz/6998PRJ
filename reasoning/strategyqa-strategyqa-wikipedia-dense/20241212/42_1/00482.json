        "First of all, when it comes to picking a company's employee, it's important to make sure it's a safe one for the employee to use. In order to avoid a possible error, it's important to know where the company's staff works. If the company's workers have some amount of work to do, it is important to assume that they'll still work on time if they have enough material to fill the order. It's not necessary that the company has any compensation unless the employee is asked to perform extra work. However, the company might have the workers do it anyway and may not need to pay the employees any compensation. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to identify what tipping is. It's the pay of a waiter or other service in general, especially while waiting. Generally, waiters should pay a check or a tip in exchange for their time. However, it's sometimes necessary to follow that 'tipping' refers to the way that the waiter does his or her job. This means the waiter will always be paid a small tip, or some other type of tip. Next, we need to consider the timing of the visit. The key to tipping is to be on a timetable, not just to the time allocated to the visit. Having a long wait is important for the host to be paid well; it can be particularly difficult to see when you are in a rush or need to take a break. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Step 1: When examining the paperwork of a waitress to see if there were any tipping, they need to read the policies and make sure that they are properly executed. Step 2: Checking the current level of pay for waitstaff. In the most cases, the system is not fully regulated, and there may be a set limit at the time of service that has been set. Step 3: While some staff may agree to use additional tips when they are not scheduled for duty, some are more relaxed about giving tip payments and do not require a waiter to leave them a tip, such as for a meal or drink. Step 4: This means that the service is not fully regulated, and that tipping is not paid at all, or is paid for after a specific time period. While most waiters may be at work on a shift, some may find that they can be given more tips. Step 5: If a waiter leaves his check on time to pay for a delivery, the person is always provided with tips. If the person is doing the delivery at the time of service, it means that they will receive a larger portion of their wage and thus should not receive tip payments from the service. Step 6: The overall effect of tipping is that the overall level of service is not paid or, in the most cases, the waiter has a high percentage of the customer's -worth of tipping or a gratuity payment. Step 8: Waiting staff may be obligated to do so. However, at least there is not a tax or insurance coverage required to avoid tipping. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what tipping is. It is used in the United States and Canada in the workplace, in various countries, and at the hotels, catering, or food services of the various restaurants. Next, we need to determine if there are countries that do not need tipping, such as Mexico, Uruguay, or Australia. We do have to know the amount of tipping that occurs in these countries, and how much the tip may be. Tipping is generally paid by the waiter, usually directly in cash, but may be not enough to compensate for the worker's inconsistency. Thus, the correct answer is (B) no, there are countries where waiters do not need tips or tipping is not necessary. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what tipping and tips are. It's usually a monetary payment that is only recurrently provided when the client or customer is awaited. And it's not like tipping is optional, despite how the customer may be spelled, if the customer pays a tip. Next, we need to consider the number of people referred to in the question and the frequency of each of these people. While not every place where a wait staff needs to receive tipping is a pay rate that typically increases, there are many destinations where staff need to go and pay for tips. When an enlisting team is going through such a process, there is a strong belief that there is a need for tipping. Therefore, it's likely that there are countries where wait staff need to pay a tip. Therefore, the answer is yes, there are some countries where waiting staff need no tip and need to receive the tip. Answer: A"

        "Gratuity . In countries where tipping is the norm, such as in the US, Canada, and in a few countries in Western Europe, some employers pay workers with the expectation that their wages will be supplemented by tips. Some have criticized the inherent \"social awkwardness\" in transactions that involve tipping, the inconsistency of tipping for some services but not similar ones, and the irrationality of basing tips on price, rather than the amount and quality of service (a customer pays a larger tip to a server bringing them a lobster rather than a hamburger, for example). Also in countries where tips are not paid by most but where many do, managers tell new waiters that the salary might not be so high but there will be tips, meaning that waiters get little payment from those who do not pay tips."
