        "Al-Farabi was a late Egyptian/Umayad, who was considered one of the greatest architects of modern Islamic philosophy. His writings were in areas such as philosophy, history, philosophy, and literature. Moreover, Muhammad was not considered to be a \"poverty\" or the king. However, he would have been associated with Al-Farabi's life and philosophy through his work. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, Al-Farabi did not meet Muhammad as he studied in Arabic literature. It has been concluded from a historical perspective that Al-Farabi did not meet Mohammed before his writings. Answer: B",
        "Al-Farabi was a British politician and philosopher. Muhammad was known for his work on politics. But his writings and intellectual work were often considered a rebuke for his later time. His writings on politics and culture were frequently criticized and criticised. Thus, the question is based on his writings. His writings also were criticized by religious scholars, who were more inclined to believe in the power of the state or its king. He was criticized for using his work to expand his religious beliefs. Therefore, the answer to the question is a definite \"no,\" assuming that Muhammad had been in the same place for years before his writings. Whether or not Al-Farabi had co-existed with Mohammed and his writings satirize a different religious perspective from Islam. Answer: One",
        "Firstly, we need to identify who Al-Farabi is and who Muhammad is. Al-Farabi is an acclaimed Islamist thinker, who is known for his work as a scholar of Islamic philosophy and writing. He is also known for his writing style, which he writes, especially in the Islamic and Western languages. Now, he may have known about Mohammed, who died in a minor way during the Islamic world during the Islamic dynasty. So, his relationship with Mohammed was somewhat different from his daytimes. Rather, he was known for his writing style, but his writing style was often inspired by Islamic theology and his critical analysis of the Islamic world. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (A) yes. Al-Farabi may have spoken to Mohammed about what he knew about his past and he would have been willing to share his details with him. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, the question posed by Al-Farabi asks what he meant by \"Mohammad\" or \"Asylum.\" Muhammad is a book and authority figure who is known for identifying issues of the Islamic tradition. Therefore, the question is considered incorrect and incorrect because it does not state who al-Farabi ever met Mohammed or who Muhammad was. However, the answer is correct and correct. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to consider who Al-Farabi and Mohammed were. Al-Farabi was a high-nigiated theoretician who was highly influential in early Islam, most notably Muhammad (the prophet). However, there is little to prove that al-Farabi spoke with Mohammed. According to a recent biography by the Islamic Republic Center, there is no recognizable contact between the two men. This does not make sense as it is not clear if Al-Farabi was alive during or after the Persian Empire. Therefore, while there is no proof to this claim, we can assume that Al-Farabi was alive when he took part in the Persian Empire. The answer is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "Islamic democracy . The early Islamic philosopher, Al-Farabi (c. 872\u2013950), in one of his most notable works \"Al-Madina al-Fadila\", theorized an ideal Islamic state which he compared to Plato's \"The Republic\". Al-Farabi departed from the Platonic view in that he regarded the ideal state to be ruled by the prophet, instead of the philosopher king envisaged by Plato. Al-Farabi argued that the ideal state was the city-state of Medina when it was governed by Muhammad, as its head of state, as he was in direct communion with God whose law was revealed to him. In the absence of the prophet, Al-Farabi considered democracy as the closest to the ideal state, regarding the republican order of the Rashidun Caliphate as an example within early Muslim history. However, he also maintained that it was from democracy that imperfect states emerged, noting how the republican order of the early Islamic Caliphate of the Rashidun caliphs was later replaced by a form of government resembling a monarchy under the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties."
