        "First, we need to know the number of people who did not kill with their own hands in 1971. That number is 252, which means that it's 30. Next, we need to answer some additional questions about whether or not Don King murdered more people than Charles Manson who did. Charles Manson was convicted in 1971 of first-degree murder, and had a series of convictions for nine murders. Now, let's take the question (A) yes, did Don King kill more people than Charles Manson in 1971? Yes, Charles Manson is convicted in 1971 of first-degree murder, and had a series of murders committed in his lifetime. He had one murders that resulted in a conviction and at least a third total, so we cannot rule out those being involved. However, this is not necessarily the case, as there are multiple factors that might have involved their actions in 1971, such as the fact that Don King took possession of weapons, such as the resulting arrest in 1971, and the subsequent execution of the second-degree murder case. Also, the second-degree murder case involved in John Donson's 1971 crime was the first to commit any person to death. This is not the first instance of this type of crime being committed. In fact, many people were killed because of their own actions, while it was in some cases not necessarily related to their own killings. However, there is no sign of any relationship between Don King and Charles Manson, which means that Don King has much more power than Charles Manson. This means that while Don King has a greater power in this regard, there is no doubt that Charles Manson did kill more people than Charles Manson with his own hands. Thus, the correct answer is (A) yes, Do Not King has killed more people than Charles Manson did with his own hands in 1971. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to define the exact number of individuals involved in the crimes. Don King committed five murders and nine others in his time. Next, let's consider who Charles Manson is. Charles Manson died in 1971, a year less than Don King. He was once considered the most hated of all time by the Nazis and was the greatest loutist in American history. He continued to cultize, and was eventually arrested and convicted of eight murders in the United States. In this instance, Don King committed nine murders and took out seven others in his life. Now, what happens to Charles Manson? Don King and Charles Manson are closely related figures and are the master of rituals of the former leader of the Manson. While they have a strong tradition of killing, this is not an accident that makes sense. It is the killings in 1971 that are related to Charles Manson's beliefs and actions to the Manson family or murders. In fact, Charles Manson's followers are believed to have been responsible for the deaths and murders of more people, rather than Charles Manson, who has been convicted of several murders and conspiracy to commit them. Given these facts, it is highly unlikely that his actions and actions may have been more destructive or dangerous than Don King or Charles Manson. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand who Don King and Charles Manson are. Don King is a vocal songwriter, who was a member of the cult group known as the \"Manson Family\" during the 1960s and 1970s. After that, we need to explain the amount of time that Don King was sentenced in the first place. Don King was sentenced in a similar manner to Charles Manson in 1971, but Charles Manson did not commit any of the murders or kills. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to establish who Don King is. Charles Manson was a notorious killer who killed over 7 people in 1971. Therefore, it would be appropriate for us to assume that the time taken to kill a person with his own hand has not been longer. Next, we need to evaluate how much has been involved with Charles Manson. Charles Manson had murdered 7 people in the 1970s, while Don King did not, as he was sentenced to seven for murdering him. Therefore, the answer is (A) no. In 1971, Don King killed more people than Charles Manson. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, Charles Manson killed more people than Don King did with his own hands in 1971. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what the difference is between Don King and the character Charles Manson. Don King was a crime and singer of the cult gang Manson, who was convicted for killing seven people in his death in 1967 in Chicago. Charles Manson was a disgraced musician and singer-songwriter from New York who lived in Manhattan as an undocumented resident. Later, he committed a series of murders at places such as the North Street Forum and The Black Larner, in 1973. He committed second-degree murder in a series of murder in 1971, when he was sentenced to a seven-year prison sentence for the murder of three slain workers. Therefore, it is impossible for Don King to kill more people than Charles Manson in 1971. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, Don King has not killed more people than Charles Manson did with his own hands in 1971. Answer: B"
