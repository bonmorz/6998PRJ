        "First, we need to identify who each astronaut is. This includes person's personal and professional relationships. They also include information about their space travel from their time of service as a former astronaut. Now, we need to determine what the limits of an astronaut's space travel are in order to determine if the person has been physically or psychologically able to survive. For example, we can determine if the person is physically able to handle a heavy load, such as a car or an airplane. In a general sense, a person has been in continuous travel throughout a vast time range, whereas a single person has only a limited amount of space. In other words, if a person has flown more than 50 miles (80 km) above the mesosphere, the person must have flowed more than 60 mph above the mesosphere in the same time range. Similarly, the person is able to communicate with other astronauts, so the answer to the question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand who astronauts are. Astronauts are people with specialized knowledge and experience in space. Next, we need to know who the limit of space travel is. Space travel is a horizontal flight that uses gravity and orbit to travel. This limits their kinetical momentum and accelerates their trajectory. Since space travel is measured in meters, we can assume that it is around 3 million meters in its range, depending on the type of mission. However, it is impossible for all astronauts to survive onboard the spacecraft, due to the inherent limitations of space travel. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, every astronaut has survived their space journey. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define the term \"earthquake.\" It is an international term meaning a distance of at least 500 miles. Next, we need to define what constitutes an astronaut. An astronaut is someone who has flown up to 50 miles above sea level. If they are flying high pressure flight, it is likely that they have been forced to fly over an uneven barrier. However, the boundaries between space and earthquakes can be defined by a unique geometry, which allows for a combination of aerodynamics, such as the \"Voyage of the Orion\". As a result, we can guess that the current definition of an astronaut could be somewhat arbitrary and may be incorrect. However, since there is no official definition of earthquake (scroll), it is reasonable to say that there have been no credible reports of any earthquakes or the inevitable death of an astronaut. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, every astronaut has survived their space journey. Answer: B",
        "1. The question asks if every astronaut has flown more than 50 miles below the ground. It is common knowledge that, given the current circumstances, it is unlikely that any astronaut has survived their space journey. 2. While it is clear that some astronauts have flown more than 50 miles below the earth's surface, it is important to note that the distances they have traveled do not necessarily correspond to the actual time of the journey. 3. While it is important to note the time of the rocket launch, it is important to note that the rocket launch time does not seem to exceed the current distances. In fact, there are a number of important and reliable sources of information on the actual space flight time. This includes the spacecraft explorer at the Air Station, the United States astronauts at the Space Station, NASA's Apollo missions, and the National Astronaut Center on Mars, all of which are inaccessible. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, every astronaut has survived their space journey. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, the question wants to ask about whether every astronaut has survived their spaceship. They usually take part in one or more long missions in the United States (mostly through the 1980s). Finally, the question asks if every astronaut has survived their spaceship. This is based on the fact that many astronauts have journeyed far enough to reach the limit of their own space. Therefore, it's important that every astronaut have survived their spaceship, which is based on the measurement of altitude. Since it's important that astronauts take care of their spaceship, it's important to establish their position and temperature prior to the expedition. After a particular journey, the astronauts will test the distance of their descent. However, they may have flown up their wings, which is a difficult test because they were in the space at an elevation of a given altitude of about 20Km. This would require astronauts to continue their training and conduct their research and observations, so their survival would be compromised. Hence, the answer is (A) yes, every astronaut has survived their spaceship. Answer: A"

        "K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line . The U.S. Air Force definition of an astronaut is a person who has flown more than 50\u00a0miles (~80\u00a0km) above mean sea level, approximately the line between the mesosphere and the thermosphere. NASA uses the FAI's 100-kilometer figure. The United States does not officially define a \"boundary of space\". In 2005, three veteran NASA X-15 pilots (John B. McKay, William H. Dana and Joseph Albert Walker) were retroactively (two posthumously) awarded their astronaut wings, as they had flown between and in the 1960s, but at the time had not been recognized as astronauts. The latter altitude exceeds the modern international definition of the boundary of space."
