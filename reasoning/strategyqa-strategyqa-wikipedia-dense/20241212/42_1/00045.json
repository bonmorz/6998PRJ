        "First, Arnold Schwarzenegger is a standout actor. Now, we need to consider how much his older brother is likely to be. Arnold Schwarzenegger is 21 years old. These numbers are higher than anyone else's, but he is a well known, famous actor known for bringing out the highest-profile names and movies in the recent past. Next, we need to know who black rhinos are. Black rhinos are known for being predators. While a lot of his mates are endangered, Arnold Schwarzenegger is particularly known for being physically tall with a booming nose. First, we need to determine if he is capable of deadlifting an adult black rhino. In fact, Arnold Schwarzenegger was a highly successful stunt skier, who worked hard to keep his job. Therefore, it is highly likely that he could kill a black rhino as a part of his stunts. Now, we need to know if he is likely to be able to kill an adult black rhino. For instance, if he was making a stunt with a hefty person, his upper body would have the upper body of a lion, which would be deadlifted by a lion or leopard. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, it is important to know who Arnold Schwarzenegger is. Arnold Schwarzenegger is an American actor and comedian who has appeared in many film and television roles. Next, we need to consider the behavior of black rhinoceros. Black rhinoceros are commonly seen fighting the wild - making them extremely aggressive and dangerous. However, they may only survive with limited access to shelters and food. Therefore, there is no official information for deadlifting a black rhinoceros. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what a deadlift is. A deadlift is the physical motion of a human lifting, typically with the arms or legs raised. As Arnold Schwarzenegger trained his trainer, he lifted more than 50 pounds (about 230 kg of saguraj). Next, we need to understand what a deadlift is. Deadlift is the movement of a human lifting weight over the weight of a living being. The lifting weight of an occupant can also be measured, such as by a weight of the person lifting and/or climbing. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Arnold Schwarzenegger can not fatally kill an adult black rhinocero. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, Schwarzenegger is a rapper who is known for his high-tailed hip hop songs. The song \"How to die?\" is a song that was written to Arnold Schwarzenegger's (Aaron Schwarzengger) second album release of the series. Next, we need to understand how a black rhinocere (also known as the kumaru type of rhino) would grow. It grows primarily from horn bushes and has a very high-pitched horn that can grow up to 300 kg. It is also known for a great deal of training and fighting abilities. A black rhino, on the other hand, has a mass of slats, and can grow up to almost 200 pounds or as many as 300 pounds. If this sounds like something, it is not an option, and if it were - this would mean - an adult black rhino could be deadlifted - by the crocodiles. So, as we have learned, Arnold Schwarzenegger cannot deadlift an adult black rhinocere. This means the correct answer is (B) no, if the question does indeed answer the question. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to identify the species of black rhino. Black rhinoceros are a species of wild horned antelope who hunt and rest in vast savannah forests and rivers. However, the presence of a black rhinocerus will cause the horn to crack or break, potentially threatening the female bird. However, if the horn is cracked or spooked, that's not going to help the black rhinoceros survive. The white horn would have to be trimmed to about 12 notch (sodium in the throat). This is the most common and most common method of eagle-towing and nesting, providing an optimum breeding environment for a black rhino with no threatening factors. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger can deadlift an adult black rhinocerus. Answer: A"

        "Black rhinoceros . The black rhino has a reputation for being extremely aggressive, and charges readily at perceived threats. They have even been observed to charge tree trunks and termite mounds. Black rhinos will fight each other, and they have the highest rates of mortal combat recorded for any mammal: about 50% of males and 30% of females die from combat-related injuries. Adult rhinos normally have no natural predators, thanks to their imposing size as well as their thick skin and deadly horns. However, adult black rhinos have fallen prey to crocodiles in exceptional circumstances. Calves and, very seldom, small sub-adults may be preyed upon by lions as well."
