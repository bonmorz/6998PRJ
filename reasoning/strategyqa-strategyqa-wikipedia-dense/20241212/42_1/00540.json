        "1. We are looking at a year in a year, and we are reading the Bible one week in one year. 2. Each Wednesday must be read within the year, and this is not always the case. 3. Each day is a separate day in different parts of a year, and you can choose which one to read the Bible more often. 4. We also use the weekly scrimmages, or weekly reads by the reader, for a more comprehensive overview of Bible. 5. Each Monday is a different day in the year, so it is possible that there may be a larger number of readings during the year. 6. Compared to the Bible's early years, we are currently using the year-starting days. 7 of the six-week readings is not enough time to read the Bible 15 times; however, in the mid-day hours, the passage is devoted more to the readings of Christ. 7. A day may be limited to the readings of Revelation (the Old Testament) and the New Testament, but in fact, the New Testament contains a very limited number of readings. 8. On a Wednesday or Thursday, as the weekly, we are receiving a significant amount of attention from the world's eyes, which is likely the time we would end reading the Bible. Despite these two important factors, we know that all Wednesdays are not enough to read Bible 15 times, making us better able to read the Bible 15 times more efficiently. 9. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, all Wednesdays in a year are not enough to read Bible 15 times. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to consider the length of each day. Several different seasons have different dates, but one typical day is the week before Easter, which is referred to in this question. We can see that it is not the best time to read the full Bible, as we can see in the context of this question, that means even if there are several months or months in the month of December. This is why we do not know how many times the reading takes place in an individual day, but we can guess that every single day is different from the other. The first step in answering this question is choosing whether or not all Wednesdays in a year are enough to read Bible 15 times. Therefore, we can correct the question by considering the length of each day. In the case of a day that is not enough to read Bible 15 times, we can determine that the readings is only half-hours long and that some of the readings may be longer than the number required. Therefore, the answer to the question is - (B) no. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, we need to consider the year of the Bible. It begins with Christmas Eve and ends on March 31st, 2021. Next, we need to consider the current usage of Wednesdays. In the UK, it is highly highly recommended that people read at least 1 day before Christmas to be sure they do not have to read 2 hours longer than they need to. This means if we are talking about the number of days in a year, that we can read Bible 15 times. Furthermore, we can study the biblical text using a calendar. This allows the reader to read through it while it's not in a particular order. Thus, the answer to this question is (A) yes, all Wednesdays in a year are enough to read Bible 15 times in a year. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to determine what the appropriate amount of time in the year is going to be. There are eight days in a year. According to the Bible, the average time in the year is 365 days. Next, we need to determine how many Bible books are currently being read by people. The number of books to read per day is based on many different things. Beginning with a new year, we need to determine what the bible is in the form of the Bible. First, we need to determine if all Wednesdays in a year are enough to read the Bible 15 times. This means the correct answer is (B) no, all Wednesdays in a year are not enough to read the bible 15 times. Answer: B",
        "- Let's start by showing that the standard number of readings in a year is 12000 times. This is a very strict and accurate measure, meaning that all Wednesdays in a year are only 15 times each. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, it is appropriate to read Bible 15 times in a year. Answer: A"

        "Bible Companion . By following the \"Bible Companion\" the reader is led, in small portions, through the whole Bible in a year. The Old Testament is read once in the year, and the New Testament is read twice. The plan starts on January 1 in the Book of Genesis, Book of Psalms and Book of Matthew and works its way through the scriptures as the year goes along providing around 4 chapters per day. Here is an example of a section from the \"Bible Companion\": Although the \"Bible Companion\" was developed over 100 years ago by the Christadelphians it is still widely used, year by year, within the community. Some ecclesias (individual churches) read the allotted chapters of the Bible as found in the companion during their Sunday services. Many people have the Bible Companion printed on book marks so they can easily find and follow the day's readings. There is an increasing number of apps for mobile phones and tablets which also show the daily readings. Use of the 'Bible Companion' is down to the individual's choice."
