        "First, we need to identify what is being said about Alistair Darling. At the time, he was an executive and leader of The Times, an American newspaper with a long tradition in the United States. But in recent years, he has taken a stand in support of Scottish independence in particular. However, this is not the same thing as that with the UK Parliament, and while it is possible for him to support it, it does not mean he is opposed to Scottish independence. While this is not the case for Darling as he is an author or political leader, Darling may use his political style to support independence. Therefore, based on the common sense and tradition of speaking out on behalf of the UK Parliament, we conclude that Darling is in favor of Scottish independence. Since there is no indication that Darling support anything which may appeal to Scotland, she may not be in favour of it. She may be speaking out to have an audience of people who have opposed Scottish independence, stating that he does not support it and the fact that he supports it is irrelevant to what he does. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the answer is not available. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define who Alistair Darling is. Alistair Darling is an Australian film and television actor, who is known for supporting Irish independence. He is a well-known figure in Australian film circles, who was a prominent filmmaker who was recently awarded an honorary doctorate after his birth. Now, we need to consider the question asking whether Alistair Darling endorses Scottish independence. Although I am not an official citizen of the UK, I do support allowing him a choice of Scottish independence. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know who Alistair Darling is. Alistair Darling is a British broadcaster, musician and host. Now, let's start talking about his views on Scottish independence. Essentially, \"freedom\" is a right to freedom of movement, and when he states that his views are not the same as those of a majority of Americans, we would say that he supports independence, while \"non-communist\" views are strongly aligned with social welfare. \"Freedom\" can be broadly defined as the political and economic divisions within the country, and can also refer to any government or political actions or policies on the part of the public that would violate freedom.\" Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Alistair Darling is not in favor of Scottish independence. Answer: B",
        "First of all, the question asks if Alistair Darling's support for independence is likely in support of Scottish independence. If so, he would vote yes to independence, but not overwhelmingly (even if he had supported it). Also, is James Kelman or Alistair Darling in favor of the decision for independence? Kelman: Yes, I think he supports the decision, but not for independence. Given the fact that he does not support the independence of Scotland, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to know who Alistair Darling is. He is a television presenter and film producer who is known for making short shows, including series, Comedy Central and Radio Bamboo. Next, we need to determine whether or not he supports Scottish independence. He is the star of the comedy show, The Scot's Goons, and is the main critic of the Scottish government's policies and practices, particularly with its use of technology and the use of state and local authorities. This is largely due to the lack of public funding and the use of the internet and newspaper media as an alternative source of media coverage. Therefore, it is a reasonable conclusion that he is in favor of Scotland independence. In this case, he is a prominent voice in the British legal profession, and is often opposed to legal sway over Scottish independence. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, he is not opposed to Scottish independence. Answer: B"

        "James Kelman . Despite reservations about nationalism, Kelman has voiced his support for Scottish independence, stating \"Any form of nationalism is dangerous, and should be treated with caution. I cannot accept nationalism and I am not a Scottish Nationalist. But once that is said, I favour a Yes or No decision on independence and I shall vote Yes to independence.\" In 2012 a film was made based on the short story \"Greyhound For Breakfast\". He has voiced criticism of Scottish arts funding council Creative Scotland."
