        "First, we need to know what cold and warmer weather is. Warmer temperatures typically occur in regions of high or low temperatures. Coldter temperatures are most likely experienced in areas where people are in warm or cold climates. Next, we need to consider how to calculate temperature. Temperature can be summed by means of measurements like fahrenheit, kilometres, fahrenheit, and temperature. So, the answer is (B) no, an anchovy live in colder temperatures than the warmer temperature. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, Anchovy is a type of fish that can survive in colder water environments. Colder temperature means lower air pressure and is more likely to cause shivering in an area made colder by extreme temperatures and extremes of temperature. Next, Antarctica is a part of the world that is essentially deserted at all temperatures, making it even more unlikely that Antarctica will be able to survive colder temperatures such as being in the desert during the winter. Furthermore, Antarctica is not a country with such extreme temperatures that it is impossible to capture and thus eat anchovy. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, Anchovy is not living in colder temperature waters than warmer ones. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to consider what anchovy is and if its known purpose is to live, and it is considered a non-vascular animal. Next, we need to understand what colder temperatures are. Anchovy is a type of pet, and colder temperatures do not usually result in any noticeable differences in temperatures, and therefore most humans are likely to have an allergy to anchovy. Next, we need to consider what type of shelter a anchovy usually enjoys. Therefore, we should assume that an 'all winter' weather should not exist in anchovy if its not colder temperatures or that it is not at a warm temperature. Therefore, it is important to determine if anchovy is an unprotected or not protected, because we need to determine whether anchovy lives in conditions where the temperature is colder and/or not in colder temperatures than would be desired for anchovy. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that if anchovy is outdoors, it can stay warm or cool under a cold temperature than in warmer conditions, despite being exposed to both colder temperatures and warm temperatures. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes and an anchovy lives in colder temperatures. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to know how hot anchovy is. Anchovy are scalves. Cold temperatures are below the surface of the crust, with temperatures usually below freezing temperatures. Next, we need to understand where the cold temperatures are. If we have a cold-born day, then it is not warm enough for anchovy to live in colder temperatures. Warmer temperatures are higher temperatures, and warmer temperatures, especially are closer to water surface temperatures. However, the cold temperatures decrease calfane growth, leaving the anchovy in colder temperatures. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, anchovy lives in colder temperatures than warmer ones. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define the specific temperature ranges of an oyster (average temperature and altitude) of a frozen lobster. This is the extreme temperature ranges within it, and is only a few centimeters colder than warmer. Next, we need to determine the maximum temperature (roughness) of an anchovy if it is in colder water. This temperature ranges are most suitable for anchovy, but many other species are more adapted to the colder climate. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes. Anchovy is known to live in cold waters, while warmer waters may have higher temperatures than warmer ones. Answer: A"

        "Wind chill . The effect of wind chill is to increase the rate of heat loss and reduce any warmer objects to the ambient temperature more quickly. Dry air cannot, however, reduce the temperature of these objects below the ambient temperature, no matter how great the wind velocity. For most biological organisms, the physiological response is to generate more heat in order to maintain a surface temperature in an acceptable range. The attempt to maintain a given surface temperature in an environment of faster heat loss results in both the perception of lower temperatures and an actual greater heat loss. In other words, the air 'feels' colder than it is because of the chilling effect of the wind on the skin. In extreme conditions this will increase the risk of adverse effects such as frostbite."
