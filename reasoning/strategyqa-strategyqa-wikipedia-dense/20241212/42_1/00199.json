        "First, the Toronto Star is a local newspaper that was released in 1994. Now, let's consider the time. The Toronto Star is a national broadcast television show broadcast by TV. On average, the total number of TV stations on its television network in 1994 was around 60,000 hours. Now, we need to consider the average lifespan of the time people spend on television programming. At present, for television programs a time cap of 12 minutes, is 365 minutes. According to the United Kingdom Television Corporation, the average lifespan of a television program is approximately 70 years. With the Toronto Star's global broadcast, the average lifespan for a television season is about 35 years. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, someone cannot sell their time through the Toronto Star. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define what a person is doing. It is important to recognize that someone is a person, not a company. So, if someone is selling things, it is not possible for them to sell their time through the Toronto Star. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, someone can sell their time through the Toronto Star. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what the Toronto Star is. It is an astronomical organization that broadcasts the time period from 1916 to 1868. Next, we need to consider the time required to produce new space travel times. Since space travel requires a bit of effort, it is unlikely that a person can make time travels. However, if the time travel times for the Toronto Star is less than the time spent on space travel, it would be necessary to consider other sources of income and the circumstances of the time travel of the individual. Now, let's discuss about selling time. During the time travel period, the primary time travel industry has been in flux and requires enormous spending energy to keep the time flow consistent. Therefore, it is unlikely that a person would make time travel travel through the Toronto Star even if they did not have the time to start the time travel cycle or the necessary investment in time for the time travel. It is not recommended for people to attempt selling their time through the Toronto Star. However, if they intend to do so, they will likely face a lot of risks due to the cost and time. It is not a wise thing to expect people to be selling their time. It is best to start from a source that has a real market or industry which does not require massive investment or time commitments. Thus, the answer to this question is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First of all, it is unlikely that someone would sell their time through the Toronto Star because it is so dense in space and doesn't have the potential to do so. However, the Toronto Star has been in existence for millions of years, and it has been viewed by millions as an excellent source for marketing information. Since most of us know what the Toronto Star is, we are aware that it is not a good place to sell time. Thus, the answer to the question is no, there is no room for selling someone's time through the Toronto Star. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B"

        "White dwarf . White dwarfs were found to be extremely dense soon after their discovery. If a star is in a binary system, as is the case for Sirius B or 40 Eridani B, it is possible to estimate its mass from observations of the binary orbit. This was done for Sirius B by 1910, yielding a mass estimate of 0.94 . (A more modern estimate is 1.00 .) Since hotter bodies radiate more energy than colder ones, a star's surface brightness can be estimated from its effective surface temperature, and that from its spectrum. If the star's distance is known, its absolute (overall) luminosity can also be estimated. From the absolute luminosity and distance, the star's surface area and its radius can be calculated. Reasoning of this sort led to the realization, puzzling to astronomers at the time, that Sirius\u00a0B and 40\u00a0Eridani\u00a0B must be very dense. When Ernst \u00d6pik estimated the density of a number of visual binary stars in 1916, he found that 40 Eridani B had a density of over 25,000 times the Sun's, which was so high that he called it \"impossible\". As Arthur Stanley Eddington put it later in 1927: We learn about the stars by receiving and interpreting the messages which their light brings to us. The message of the Companion of Sirius when it was decoded ran: \"I am composed of material 3,000 times denser than anything you have ever come across; a ton of my material would be a little nugget that you could put in a matchbox.\" What reply can one make to such a message? The reply which most of us made in 1914 was\u2014\"Shut up. Don't talk nonsense.\""
