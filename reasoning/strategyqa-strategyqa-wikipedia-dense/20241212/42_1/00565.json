        "First, we need to understand what Eid al-Fitr is. Eid al-Fitr is the religious holy holiday celebrating the end of Ramadan. However, we can recognize that Eid al-Fitr is a secular holiday known as a part of Islamist tradition that commemorates the start of the first month of Ramadan. Eid al-Fitr is not a religious event, but it is a secular festival that occurs once a week before the New Year's Day. Furthermore, it occurs between 4-7 and 5-7 days during the Eid of Ramadan, which is the annual Christian holiday of Ramadan. Finally, we can see how religious the entire US Office is structured. Eid al-Fitr is the official holiday observed by Muslims across the globe where Muslims believe in fasting, prayer, and celebration of the holy month of Ramadan. Muslims also celebrate Ramadan by fasting during the Holy month of Ramazu, the religious religious holiday for Muslims. In this case, Eid al-Fitr is the feast day of Ramadan, the holy month of Ramazu. While Eid al-Fitr is a Muslim holiday, Muslim religious theology may be forbidden to view entire US Office. So, unless Muslim religious theology is not questioned, it is unnecessary to watch the entire US Office. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to understand what the entire US Office is. The US Office is a public program intended for Muslims worldwide, which provides guidance and information around the holiday. Now, let's see the question. \"Is it appropriate to watch the entire US Office\" (It is a Muslim calendar) from October 3, 2014 to September 8, 2016, when Eid al-Fitr occurs. It is considered a time of pause, thus, it is inappropriate to watch the entire US Office. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, Eid al-Fitr is appropriate and the entire US Office is viewing during the holiday celebration. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to consider the dates of the Eid al-Fitr holiday. Eid al-Fitr is the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, an Islamic calendar that marked the end of Ramadan. Eid al-Fitr is an official holiday celebrated in the United States on the first day of the month of Ramadan and marks the end of the month of Ramadan. In this festival, Muslims are forbidden to observe the 30 minutes holy month of Ramadan. According to the Islamic calendar, the day of Ramadan is on the 29 or 30th day in the month of Shawwal. Next, we need to consider the content of this holiday. The US Office has been broadcast on YouTube since March 21, 2014, but this holiday would be inappropriate if it be considered to be offensive. Considering the variety of TV shows that the US Office has presented to the public, it might be appropriate to watch the entire TV show. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what Eid al-Fitr (Arabian Holiday) is. Eid al-Fitr is a religious and holiday in Islam that marks the end of the year. It is not the largest day in the US office, and it cannot be seen in large numbers. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, Eid al-Fitr is not acceptable. Answer: A",
        "First, Eid al-Fitr is a Christian festival or annual event celebrated by Muslims, usually held on the first or last day of Ramadan (Brazil, 28 April, 2003). Next, we need to determine the calendar month for Eid al-Fitr. Eid al-Fitr is the Islamic holy month of Ramadan which occurs during the entire month of Ramadan (24 February, 2009). Since Muslims are mostly Christians, they are not permitted to fast, and the entire US Office, based on the calendar, is not known to be an adequate viewing point for the entire US Office. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A"

        "Eid al-Fitr . Eid al-Fitr ( \"\", ) is an important religious holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide that marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting (\"sawm\"). This religious Eid (Muslim religious festival) is the first and only day in the month of Shawwal during which Muslims are not permitted to fast. The holiday celebrates the conclusion of the 29 or 30 days of dawn-to-sunset fasting during the entire month of Ramadan. The day of Eid, therefore, falls on the first day of the month of Shawwal. The date for the start of any lunar Hijri month varies based on when the new moon is sighted by local religious authorities, so the exact day of celebration varies by locality."
