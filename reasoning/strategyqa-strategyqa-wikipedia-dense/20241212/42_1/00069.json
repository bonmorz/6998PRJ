        "The 2008 Summer Olympics had three athletes in the single sculls and two in the single sculls at the 2008 Summer Olympics. To do this, you need to gather the necessary information: A rowing machine, usually referred to as a 'bobber' or a \"jack\". Usually, a 550 horse bike has a body of this size and is not likely to be capable of running on the road. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, a 550 horse could be driven by a crew from the Olympic Games, while the correct answer is (A) no. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, a Ryk'e 550 is a two-stroke aircraft racer with a maximum speed of 280 mph (100 km/h) and a maximum speed of 370 mph (150 km/h). To accommodate for the speed of 280, the driver cannot move a 550 at the current speed. This is an incorrect statement as it is highly unlikely that a rower of this size would be able to fit into the norm of the 2008 Summer Olympics. The answer is (B) no, a rower would not be able to fit in the belt of a Ryk'e 550 to compete in the 2008 Summer Olympics. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know the minimum age for a 550 scull to ride at the 2008 Summer Olympics. The Olympics have been set at 100 sculls and have not been raced since 2002. Next, we need to understand the amount of time required to drive a 550 scull to reach the 2008 Summer Olympics. This can be up to three hours at the top of their respective range. Assumed that the minimum age for a 550 scull is not 75 sculls or over 40 sculls, so the answer is (A) no. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand the age difference between Rowe M250 and Rowe 550. The speed at which a Rowe M250 moves is 450 mph, which is a speed that requires speeding up to over 300 miles per hour. Next, we need to know what the 2008 Summer Olympics were. In 2008, the Summer Olympics consisted of 20 days and 12 countries. These two nations have not been ranked as the fastest. On the other hand, Rowe M250 has an average speed of 324 miles per hour, which is a speed that is much faster than 550 miles per hour. If you took a boat, you can use a larger bus. Therefore, it is highly likely that a Rowe M250 could safely fit into a rowing car during the 2008 Summer Olympics. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand that there is no way to speed or drive a 550-litre vehicle to the 2008 Summer Olympics. This means that no rowing equipment can be driven through the 8 hour limit in the summer. Now, we need to consider the weight and weight of the racer. This is an important amount because the speed of a ship could double the speed of a 550-litre boat. So the answer is (A) no. Answer: A"

        "Kirsten van der Kolk . Together with Marit van Eupen she participated at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney where they finished in sixth position in the lightweight double sculls. Four years later, they took part in Athens at the 2004 Summer Olympics, where they won the bronze medal. After those Olympics she retired from rowing and gave birth to a child. Less than one year before the 2008 Summer Olympics, she decided to return and became a team again with Marit van Eupen, who had become three times world champion in the non-Olympic lightweight single sculls (LW1x) during the absence of van der Kolk. In 2008, they came second in the Rowing World Cup meeting in Luzern and they qualified themselves for their third Olympics. On 17 August 2008, they won Olympic gold."
