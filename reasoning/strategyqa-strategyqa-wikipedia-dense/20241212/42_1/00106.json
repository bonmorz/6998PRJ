        "First, we need to determine what kind of products United Airlines sells. Glycol is commonly used as an alternative for antifreeze and is a common ingredient in many foods and liquids. However, because it contains propylene glycol, it is unlikely to meet the level of purity in United Airlines commercial jets that they would use. Therefore, in order to avoid further risk, United Airlines does not endorse Glycol. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to define the brand of glycol that U.S. Airline is using. U.S. Airline has approved the use of glycol glycol in all official products and products. Therefore, the question is correct; the answer is \"yes\". Therefore, the answer to the question is based on United Airlines' stated endorsement for use of \"non-toxic antifreeze.\" The correct answer is \"non-toxic antifreeze.\" The question is not asking whether or not this product would be sold in the United States or in other countries. Answer: p",
        "First, United Airlines primarily uses the term \"good\" as a reference to avoid carrying a large amount of glycol in their cargo. However, they may also include in their \"non-toxic, non-toxic, liquid e-liquids,\" such as petroleum-based e-liquids and other household products. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes. Because Glycol is an essential ingredient in numerous processed foods, it is not normally considered for use as a toxic ingredient in certain chemical-laden products or containers. Therefore, we can conclude that United Airlines would not buy Glycol as a hazardous element in their luggage, in a situation where consumers would be at the store or use a chemical such as petroleum e-liquids in their luggage. We can therefore conclude that Glycol would be a more dangerous ingredient to some items such as e-liquids and other foods. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what \"antifreeze\" means. Affirmed by the manufacturer's claims that the liquid is not a harmful substance. This is due to the fact that propylene glycol is used in the military's fuel oil (even though this is not a toxic chemical). Next, we need to determine the intended use of the gallium content of the substance. The average amount of glycine in a gallium gallon would be around 70 gallons/m2 to be enough for a commercial flight to Singapore. This amount is well below the recommended daily rate of approximately 7.5 grams per gallium atom, which is the minimum requirement to make an airplane safe. While some aviation companies use glycine and/or the associated gas to be the main ingredient in a product called Glylene glycol, it is generally used to be used to prevent odours or respiratory issues, such as the ingestion of a non-toxic liquid. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes. It is possible that a particular purpose of the item may be used to manufacture or store it, or to give it to a certain person (not others) for use in the flight. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes, Glycol is not something that United Airlines would buy. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to consider the amount of glycol used in United Airlines. According to United, glycol is the main ingredient in many non-toxic drugs. Secondly, we need to consider if ethylene glycol is used as an antifreeze in airlines. United Airlines is a major airline that primarily relies on petroleum products that are not readily discarded. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"Yes.\" Answer: A"

        "Antifreeze . Propylene glycol is considerably less toxic than ethylene glycol and may be labeled as \"non-toxic antifreeze\". It is used as antifreeze where ethylene glycol would be inappropriate, such as in food-processing systems or in water pipes in homes where incidental ingestion may be possible. For example, the FDA allows propylene glycol to be added to a large number of processed foods, including ice cream, frozen custard, salad dressings, and baked goods, and it is commonly used as the main ingredient in the \"e-liquid\" used in electronic cigarettes."
