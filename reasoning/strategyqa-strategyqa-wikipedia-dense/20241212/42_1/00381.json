        "1. The delivery site is the sternum, which is the ring of the brain that lays the child's head. 2. After passing through the mother's pelvic floor, the baby's head travels through the birth canal to the rumple. 3. Once into the birth canal, a baby's head is inserted into the urethra of the brain which forms a part of his or her skull (the uterus). 4. The urethra has a diameter of 10 centimeters, which is roughly the same as that of the heart. 5. In a pregnant woman, birth is usually delayed, with the birth canal being the hottest part of the birth cycle. 6. During birth, the birth canal is extended significantly, with a number of steps needed to pass it. 7. Usually, the urethra is closed as much as possible, but the space around it is sufficient to support the baby's head. 8. For an adult male skull, the birth canal may be longer than the width of the baby's skull to allow the baby to pass. However, if the baby is being transported in the birth canal and they have already passed the rectum (i.e., the uterus) through the birth canal, the urethra may not go through and allow the skull to reach the uterus. Moreover, the birth canal is not always always an efficient route for all of this pressure emulation and may not take into account the specific fetal position of the baby. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) yes. Answer: B",
        "First, the skull is a tiny piece of body that is part of the body's body--the part of the head that contains the head and rectum, which normally consists of the lower abdomen and chest. The birth canal is a small portion of the peri-uterine lobe, which enables the baby to pass through the birth canal, through a separate layer of lateral ligaments that form between the rectum and rectum. Now, we need to consider the size of the skull: a human skull is approximately 10-inches long and is roughly 30 cm in diameter. Therefore, an average human weighing around 60 kg/200 pounds is approximately 3,300 pounds. The skull can only go through the upper rectum and rectum, and it is considered a rare case if the baby doesn't pass through a thin, rectumeable layer. The diameter of lateral ligaments around the rectum and rectum, in large families, is around 30-40 feet, respectively, with an extra inch of thickness, which is approximately two inches thick. Therefore, the opening of a human skull can only be viewed in a normal amount, and it is highly unlikely that a human skull could enter into or out of the birth canal. Therefore, it is highly likely that the adult human skull could pass through the birth canal safely. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"Yes, an adult human skull hypothetically can hypothetically pass through the birth canal\" as the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define what the birth canal is. It is an organ of the reproductive system that involves the lining of the female rectum, which carries the body down the urethra, the upper rectum, and the upper rectum. Next, we need to consider the amount of time it takes for a baby to pass through the birth canal. The length of the birth canal can be approximately half an hour, with approximately 20 minutes in between the births. Next, we need to consider the birth canal. The opening to the second part of the urethra is located at the side of the pelvis. With the opening being stretched out through a tube, the skull can pass through the opening to the pelvic floor, which is typically around 2 cm wide. This means that, due to the length of the opening, the uterus and the baby's uterus can no longer pass through the birth canal. Further, due to the girdle of the urethra, the atribed uterus has no need to appoint its head through the birth canal. The entire process of cerviation or pregnancy is controlled by the uterus and the pelvic floor, and therefore, the birth canal doesn't actually go through the urethra. Therefore, the optimum answer is (B) no, an adult human skull cannot pass through the birth canal. Answer: B",
        "First of all, the birth canal is a passage for the body from the pelvis to the pelvic floor, which is located between the rectum and the pelvic floor. Next, we need to consider the size of an adult human skull. This is approximately 16 centimeters. Now let's consider the height of the skull, which is currently 16,582 cm. The skull is approximately 17 centimeters long, and has the ability to travel up to .9 meters from the pelvic floor. Now, we can understand that an adult human skull is relatively hefty, and thus has the ability to pass through the birth canal. However, this is only the small portion of the skull that can pass through the birth canal. Therefore, the answer is (B) yes, an adult human skull would likely be viable if it actually passes through the birth canal. Answer: B",
        "Firstly, the skull's head is an important part of birthing process. The birth canal - usually referred to as a body-mind barrier - includes all of the body parts and structures of the body. The birth canal is the largest portion of the body part and the main organ, the pelvic floor, which is connected to the skull. For every infant, over one million new babies are born. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is yes, an adult human skull can technically pass through the birth canal, as the body part of birth canal is the opening into the pelvic floor that divides the periothelium into the body's upper and lowermost organs. Therefore, an adult male skull could technically pass through the birth canal, as the birth canal is designed to provide an accessible access to the periothelium as well as to the mother's pelvic floor. It will usually provide enough room to accommodate the demands of birth, a closeness of the pelvic floor and a good grasp of the baby's area, and a full and stable pelvic floor - which are necessary when you want to deliver the baby from a stable position. Therefore, based on the information presented above, it is possible that an adult human skull could hypothetically pass through the birth canal, which would be a common problem with births that require the use of different, non-surgical tools, such as a labour-prolonging massage and a pelvic floor stretching (echosening from a birth canal in the neck).

        "Perineal massage . The goal of APM is to prevent the baby's head from undergoing excessive strain during the last 30 minutes of labour. It seeks to train the mother to relax her pelvic floor to allow the baby's head to pass through the opening, to stretch the two fibrous layers within the Uro-Genital Membrane, a triangular shaped muscular shelf at the front half of the opening of the bony pelvis, through which the 2\u00a0cm diameter birth canal and urethra pass, and to transform the fat packed rigid skin at the opening to the birth canal into paper thin stretchy elastic skin, all without using the baby's head.  If the external skin (perineal skin) opening has been stretched before birth, to 10\u00a0cm, then there is no reason to perform an episiotomy to increase the diameter of the opening of the birth canal. Tearing is less likely as the external skin at the opening has been stretched already and is lax, whilst the underlying muscular pelvic floor has not been damaged. Episiotomy permanently damages the pelvic floor muscle, as the episiotomy cuts through the nerve supply to this muscle, so the larger part of the pelvic floor muscles atrophies and becomes replaced by scar tissue, increasing the mother's chance of developing a prolapse in the future. Antenatal Perineal Massage does not damage the pelvic floor, so protects against a prolapse."
