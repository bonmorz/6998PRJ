        "First, we need to identify the name of a US third grader. The grammarian in question is known as the Squire (speaker), who plays guitar and guitar-based music games. The Squire, according to the Wikipedia source, is a UK branch of a pop band, founded by David Lebke in 1991. The band started out as a punk band in 1954. While the band originally composed and recorded some songs for the Beatles' demo, the \"Guitar Hero\" band was never released and played only in the United States, which gives a sense of the artists and the band's masonic personality. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. The answer is (B) no, a US third grader is not recommended for this category. Based on this, the correct answer is (B) no, Guitar Hero Beatles are not suitable for a US third grader. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to define who a US third grader is. A US Third Grader is a person who is a teenager or a young adult who is interested in music, movies or music. We need to identify and discuss the age range of the US Third Grader (American age). Since there is no age limit for the US Third Grader, it is best to compare the age range with the US Second Grader. If we compare the age range of the US Third Grader (American age) to the age of the US Third Grader, we can determine the difference. American age is 5 and the number of Americans and US Third Grader (American age) is 2. The UK average age for US Third Graders (US age) is approximately 3\u20134 years. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what Guitar Hero Beatles stands for. This song is a musical instrument used for synthesis and harmony, and has been seen in many American films and movies. However, they don't include any other popular musical instruments, including vocal and keyboard drums. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, guitar hero Beatles are not appropriate for a US third grader. Answer: A",
        "A US third grade student would play the Beatles song \"Guitar Hero\" in the game \"Rock Band\". There is no connection between this song and the US government. A US third grade student would not want to include their original song as their music, which they wrote and arranged for. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. Since there is no connection between the US third grade student and this song, it is not appropriate for them to play with the guitar Hero  Beatles music. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to know the requirements for a US third grader. The US third grader needs to be at least 15 years of age, and there are four basic levels of education. Next, we need to determine which guitar games and songs will be appropriate for the US Third Grader. Guitar games are video games that can be played by older adults. As a result, not everyone who is older than 15 can play these games. Thus, it is safe to assume that a US third grader would not find their favorite songs appropriate. However, the games are very popular in the US, so based on this fact, it is possible that Guitar Hero Beatles may do so. Based on this fact, we can answer that the answer is yes. If a US third grader could play Guitar Hero Beatles songs in a game, a school-aged person will likely play the Beatles songs. Finally, we need to determine which game and song are the appropriate for such a child. During this ageing process, it is highly important to know the age of the child, and whether the band is being allowed to play the songs and songs. Additionally, it is common knowledge that these two games are primarily suitable for US third grade students. Answer: A"

        "Cultural impact of the Guitar Hero series . Bands or those that control the copyrights on bands' works have been in talks with the makers and distributions of both \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" as methods of achieving more exposure for the band. Following the announcement of \"Guitar Hero: Aerosmith\", Martin N. \"Marty\" Bandier, executive for Sony/ATV which owns the copyrights on The Beatles compositions, stated he was very interested in helping Activision bring a Beatles-themed \"Guitar Hero\" title to the market in a similar fashion. Both Activision and MTV Games were in talks with representatives of the Beatles to create a Beatles-themed game, until MTV Games secured an exclusive license with Apple Corps, Ltd. to produce \"\". Groups such as Van Halen, The Eagles, Steely Dan and Guns N' Roses have working deals with these companies to include their songs within future games. Other artists, having playing \"Guitar Hero\" or \"Rock Band\", may approach the game developers to ask for inclusion of songs specifically for their adaptability into playable tracks. However, not all bands are comfortable with this: Led Zeppelin has turned down offers from both games to include their music due to concerns that Jimmy Page and other members of the band have with releasing the master recordings of their music. There are also cases where bands want to be included, but the master recordings have been lost or are unusable. Some bands such as the Sex Pistols, Living Colour, and Aerosmith have rerecorded these songs, while other bands have been able to provide concert \"live\" master recordings. However, some larger artists are unable to do so. Neversoft director Brian Bright states that they do not expect to acquire songs from Pink Floyd and Prince due to such reasons. With the pending release of \"The Beatles: Rock Band\", Pink Floyd is also in active discussions to include its music in either \"Guitar Hero\" or \"Rock Band\", according to representatives for EMI."
