        "First, Glutamine is a fatty acid that is typically consumed in food and drinks to maintain fluids and excitability. But glutamate is an enzyme that may contain glutamate in the form of glutamate. Now, we need to examine the background of Masaharu Morimoto. The first time he was exposed to glutamate at higher temperatures than normal, he was suffering from a mild cognitive deprasion. He was then filmed showing a certain amount of excess glutamate. Therefore, while Masaharu frequently consumed glutamate, he did not consume it. He was a natural eater who enjoyed the acidic taste of it. The glutamate contained in his food was not very pleasant, making it unpleasant. So, the answer is no, his dietary supplement Glutamine, a chemical found in high amounts in food and drinks, is not a good supplement that would lead to normal body function. However, the answer to the question is yes, Masaharu Morimoto reportedly uses glutamate in his diet to sustain body fluids and excitability. If the answer is (B) no, there is not a likely reason for the incorrect answer. In fact, however, it can suggest that glutamate can potentially trigger muscle deterioration and damage to the brain during an injection or in treatment with glutamate supplement. However, the correct answer is (B) no, the answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, we need to consider the content of glutamate in foods. It is the metabolite glutamate that a person generally eats, and therefore it is also said that these are a class of chemicals that help their cells digest better. Next, we need to consider the function of glutamate synthesiser vs. excitogenicity. So, it is likely that these chemicals, commonly associated with glutamate digesting, would be toxic in their human body or consuming it through a gut-like sterile reaction. This is in contrast to the benefits of glutamate ionizing the body through the gastrointestinal tract, especially in brain development and regulating blood turnover. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes, Makaharo Morimoto rely on glutamic acid, which is often found in derived from foods such as almonds, vegarettes, sushi, and other high-fiber foods. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what glutamate is. Glutamic acid is the chemical compound that can inhibit the activation of neurotransmitters (tUNEL). It can also affect negligonal neurons and could also cause nerve damage or other conditions that could be caused by consuming glutamate, such as tetamine. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, Masaharu Morimoto rely on glutamate. Given this information, we can conclude that it is possible that he possesses a special affinity for glutamic acid. Given the amount of glutamate found in glutamate, we can conclude that he may not necessarily rely on glutamate. The question is likely to ask, \u201cIs Masaharu Morimoto relying on glutamate?\u201d Because there are studies to validate this premise that he does indeed rely on glutamate and has a special affinity for glutamate. However, we can provide further details about the relationship between glutamate and glutamate. Answer: A",
        "Masaharu Morimoto was a Japanese actor known for his martial arts skills. He became famous for his martial arts style and began using glutamic acid as a cooking tool. Since there is no evidence to suggest that glutamate derived from glutamate in some areas, the question is based on the possibility that it originated with other parts of the body. Essentially, the purpose of Masaharo Morimoto was to use the glutamine derived from the brain to digest food. This finding was later discovered after a research study on a high glutamate content found in the body, with a significant increase in glutamate levels from glutamate. Thus, the answer is yes, Masaharo Morimoto rely on glutamic acid. Based on these facts, it is inferred that if Mako has any interest in using glutamate as a cooking tool, he may rely on it to cook his meals. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, and Masaharu Morimoto relying on glutamate is capable of using it to digest food in one's diet. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to know what glutamate is. Glutamic acid (Gl) is a chemical produced by the gastrointestinal system in humans, and it is found in the blood cell and brain. Additionally, gastrointestinal metabolism is driven by this chemical, which is oxidized into glutamate. Secondly, we need to understand if Masaharu Morimoto rely on glutamate. It is a glutamate found by an infusion of glutamate in the digestive tract of a deficient person. Glutamate does not have any physiological or digestive function in its system, making it an unrequited ingredient to eat in the intestines. Therefore, we need to find more accurate information on this property in a study or scientific experiment involving humans. Given the fact that glutamate is a chemical in the blood and is mainly absorbed by a deficient person in response to oxidation in the human body, one can conclude that Masaharu Morimoto primarily relies on glutamate. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, yes, he rely on glutamate. Answer: A"

        "Glutamate flavoring . Because glutamate is absorbed very quickly in the gastrointestinal tract (unlike glutamic acid-containing proteins in foods), glutamate could spike blood plasma levels of glutamate. Glutamic acid is in a class of chemicals known as excitotoxins, high levels of which have been shown in animal studies to cause damage to areas of the brain unprotected by the blood\u2013brain barrier and that a variety of chronic diseases can arise out of this neurotoxicity. There has been debate among scientists on the significance of these findings since the early 1970s, when John Olney found that high levels of glutamic acid caused damage to the brains of infant mice. The debate is complex and has focused mainly on whether the increase in plasma glutamate levels from typical ingestion levels of glutamate is enough to cause neurotoxicity and on whether humans are susceptible to the neurotoxicity from glutamic acid seen in some animal experiments."
