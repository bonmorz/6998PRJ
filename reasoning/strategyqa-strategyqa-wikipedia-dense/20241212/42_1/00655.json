        "First, we know what Kangaroos are and the typical nomadic behaviour. One of the main features of Kangaroos are large feet, meaning they are primarily used for food harvesting. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is (B) no, Australians don't ride Kangaroos to work. Answer: B",
        "First, it is important to understand the basic requirements for Australians. They are not known to do anything that requires them to eat or ride animals or horses. Therefore, it is important that we consider a number of factors to determine whether Australians ride their kangaroo to work. Specifically, they are referred to as \"cars,\" as a means of transport or entertainment. Now, it is important to consider the kangaroos' size. They range in size and weight, and are not considered to be primarily inanimate or otherwise. In fact, the most common kangaroo species in Australia are the kangarooo, aka Macropus kangaroo and Antilopine kangaroo. Macropus is the largest of all kangaroo species in Australia and the largest of the kangaroo family. Therefore, we can only assume that Australia doesn't ride kangaroos because they are not native to Australians and they can't be taken to work without permission. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the Australians do not ride kangaroos and they would never be able to work without permission or make sure that they were not allowed to ride them or take them away. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer: B",
        "First, what is the term for a kangaroo? It's a name used by several groups of Australians, including people who have landed in Australia to get a job. The term is commonly used as a compliment term for people who have spent time in a country, such as New Zealand or Australia. On the other hand, people who have landed in the country are often unfamiliar with the culture or critisizing nature of kangaroos. They may find it difficult to understand who is at work in a commercial field in the Australian wild. However, it isn't illegal and therefore, this question is highly unlikely to be answered. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, there is no evidence to support the claim that Australians can ride kangaroos because their owners are not native to Australia. Therefore, we should know that there is no way to describe Australians riding kangaroos. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand what a kangaroo is. A kangaroo is a chimpanzeal-sized animal that has some feet, which means they're large and they can be ridden by humans. Next, we need to understand what a kangaroo is. An kangaroo is a large mammal native to Australia and has feet. One common reason for a kangaroo's tail is to keep themselves strong and enthralled in the air. One reason is that Australians do not want their kangaroos to land on the ground, and it's important to use a safety belt before using them. So, based on this information, we can conclude that if an Australian citizen is trying to get a ride on a kangaroo, then it might be a safe and comfortable option to a lot of different animals. Therefore, we can conclude that a few people from Australians do not ride the kangaroo to work because it would cause harm to its feet and make it unstable if a person takes off to work. Instead, it would likely be best to consider the correct answer to the question, which is (B) no, they do not do Australian citizens ride kangaroos to work. Answer: B"

        "Kangaroo . The kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning \"large foot\"). In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, especially those of the genus \"Macropus\": the red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia. The Australian government estimates that 34.3 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2011, up from 25.1 million one year earlier."
