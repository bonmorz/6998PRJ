Few of us have the brilliance of a (Judge Charles E.) Wyzanski or a (Judge) Learned Hand. What you have is a respect for the law, a knowledge of the principles and a desire to do the best job you can. Good lawyers make good judges. Any lawyer can make a judge look bad.

A judge should just be there with a knowledge of the law and leave the lawyering to the lawyers.\""
