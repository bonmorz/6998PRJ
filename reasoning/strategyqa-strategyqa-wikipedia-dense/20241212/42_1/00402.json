        "Pitaya . \"Stenocereus\" fruit (sour pitayas) are a variety that is commonly eaten in the arid regions of the Americas. They are more sour and refreshing, with juicier flesh and a stronger taste. The sour pitaya or \"pitaya agria\" (\"S. gummosus\") in the Sonoran Desert has been an important food source for indigenous peoples of the Americas. The Seri people of northwestern Mexico still harvest the fruit, and call the plant \"ziix is ccapxl\" \"thing whose fruit is sour\". The fruit of related species, such as \"S. queretaroensis\" and the dagger cactus (\"S. griseus\"), are also locally important foods. The fruit of the organ pipe cactus (\"S. thurberi\", called \"ool\" by the Seris) is the \"pitaya dulce\" \"sweet pitaya\". It still has a more tart aroma than \"Hylocereus\" fruit, described as somewhat reminiscent of watermelon; it has some uses in traditional medicine."
