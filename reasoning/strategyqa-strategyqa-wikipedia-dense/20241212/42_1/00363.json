        "Griffin family . Justin Peter Griffin, or Justin Peter Griffin (formerly Peter L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u Griffin Sr.), born Justin Peter Griffin, voiced by Seth MacFarlane. Peter is the father of the Griffin family, a stereotypical blue-collar worker. Head of the Griffin family is Irish-American Catholic Peter, an obese and bespectacled man who is just a big child. He has other roots beside his Irish ones, including African-American, Spanish, Scottish and German. In an interview with \"The Advocate\" MacFarlane described him as \"Archie Bunker without the knowledge of what he's doing. He has the mind of a child, basically, and a source of big laughs is when he does not realize he's doing something inappropriate.\" In the season four episode \"Petarded\", Peter takes an I.Q. test, and discovers that his low intellect places him in a category slightly below mentally retarded, but higher than a creationist. He is incredibly jealous of other attractions Lois has in her life, an attitude that tends to get out of hand in most cases, even assaulting a whale that kissed Lois at SeaWorld. In the season three episode \"Stuck Together, Torn Apart\", Peter and Lois split up because of Peter's jealousy only to discover that Lois has the same character flaw and the two decide to live with their mutually jealous nature. Peter has a very short attention span and frequently ends up in bizarre situations, as Chris points out in \"Long John Peter\", after Peter's parrot dies \"He will get over it pretty quickly and then move on to another wacky thing\", to which Peter finds a pipe organ and forgets about his parrot."
