        "First, it's important to understand the position of a duke. A duke can be considered a male noble who is represented in the order of the military. Secondly, we need to compare the status of a Tsar in a general sense. A Tsar is an elite state or military establishment, with an authority to govern, control, and supervise. Therefore, a high ranking Dhickey would likely be a subordinate to a Tsar based on his own rule of power and power. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, a duke would hypothetically be subservient to a Tsar, as defined by the situation that a king would fall in line with, and the appropriate response would be to be - A. Answer: A",
        "First, we need to understand how a duke would be considered sub-serving. Under the jurisdiction of the Soviet Union, the government of the US and Soviet Union will have the authority to sub-ordinate all power and authority to the Republic of Russia. Next, we need to understand the role of the tsar. The Tsar is an armed body that controls and governs all of the state's territory and administration. It has the authority to govern, overlord, and control the people of the USSR. Now, we need to consider the other facets of a man's power and responsibilities as they are related to a king and Tsar. Often, a tsar can be considered a sovereign and super-rich person, whereas a king can be under the control of the king's kings. These factors play a role in the overall direction of a king or a tsar's management. Thus, if a king was under the control of the throne or of the government, it would likely be sub-serviciing to a tsar. This would result in his ability to directly influence the government and effect a series of policies, decisions, and actions on his behalf. These factors all tie into a power structure that is responsible for ensuring a successful and peaceful administration of the tsar. Therefore, while a king might be considered sub-servicier to a tsar, it does not make sense to assume that he would be under a tsar. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, the question is asking whether a duke would be subservicing to a Tsar. If it is, it is a question that pertains to the succession of the King of Poland. However, it has only four aspects, which the Tsar is the chief ruling authority, as opposed to the noble Duke of Poland. In other words, the Tsar is the major party with power in their country, so a duke would be subservicing to him. It is not clear whether a Tsar would be a heir to a king or a noble Duke. Regardless of their ruling style, it is not highly resembling that he would be subserving to a Tsar as it is for him to govern and act as a ruler. The correct answer is (A) yes. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, duke is a noble monarch (samurai) who was known for espionage and related to military operations of the past. Furthermore, a Tsar is a state-owned governmental entity who has the power to control or control over any territory. Therefore, when a duke is subserving to a Tsar, there may be a subordinate position in the legal realm. Therefore, if a duke would have the power to impose the responsibilities of a Tsar upon his or her own family, it would be extremely difficult to control a Tsar. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, a duke would hypothetically be subservient to a Tsar. Answer: A",
        "Firstly, we need to understand what a duke is. This term is for an heir to a monarch who possesses the property of a lord or power. The heir is the son or successor to the monarch, and they are considered the royal descendants of the monarchs. Next, we need to look at Alexander Jagiellon's history and his relationships with the Tsar. He was known for his open, direct, and prestigious duties that other kings had not. His authority lay in the rule and estates of the imperial kings, and as such, he is a heir to the throne of a king or power. Therefore, a duke is considered to have a higher standing than the Tsar and does not have the power to possess the throne of a monarch. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, a nobleship would have attained significant positions in the throne of a dynasty and the granting of certain privileges for their kinks and their rulers. Answer: B"

        "Alexander Jagiellon . Alexander was born as son of the King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland and Elisabeth Habsburg of Hungary, daughter of the King Albert of Hungary. Alexander's shortage of funds immediately made him subservient to the Polish Senate and nobility (szlachta), who deprived him of control of the mint (then one of the most lucrative sources of revenue for the Polish kings), curtailed his prerogatives, and generally endeavored to reduce him to a subordinate position. For want of funds, Alexander was unable to resist the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights or prevent Grand Duke of Muscovy Ivan III from ravaging Grand Duchy of Lithuania with the Tatars. The most the Grand Duke of Lithuania could do was to garrison Smolensk and other strongholds and employ his wife Helena, the Tsar's daughter, to mediate a truce between his father-in-law and himself after the disastrous Battle of Vedrosha (1500). In the terms of the truce, Lithuania had to surrender about a third of its territory to the nascent expansionist Russian state."
