We can learn that the company was formed through the merger of the Italian car company Fiat and the American car company Chrysler in 2014. \n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that Fiat Chrysler is associated with Japanese cars. To confirm this, we can look at the brands and models that are produced and sold under the Fiat Chrysler umbrella.
