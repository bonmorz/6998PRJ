To determine whether this particular movie is likely to be shown on the flight, we need to consider the audience, duration of the flight, and airline policy.\n\nFirstly, let's consider the audience. Batman is generally considered to be a PG-13 film, meaning that it is intended for audiences 13 years and older. It may not be suitable for young children or families traveling together, as it contains mild violence, dark themes, and some suggestive content.\n\nNext, let's think about the duration of the flight. A flight from New York to Kansas City typically lasts around 3 hours, which could comfortably accommodate watching a full-length movie. Batman runs for 126 minutes, making it a candidate for in-flight entertainment.\n\nFinally, we need to consider the airline policies. Some airlines have restrictions on the type of movies they show inflight, as well as the age restrictions. However, assuming that the airline has no such restrictions, the likelihood of Batman being shown on the flight is high.\n\nTherefore, based on our analysis, we can conclude that the answer is (A) yes, Batman (1989 film) is likely to be shown on a flight from NY to Kansas City provided the airline has no restrictions on the movie's content."
