Each lifter gets three attempts at each lift and their highest successful lift in each is added together to determine their total score. \n\nNow, Schwarzenegger and Bj\u00f6rnsson are both very strong individuals, but they have different body types and different strengths. Schwarzenegger was a bodybuilder and competed in some powerlifting competitions, but Bj\u00f6rnsson is a professional strongman and powerlifter known for his amazing strength feats, including breaking the deadlift world record.\n\nTherefore, it is highly unlikely that Schwarzenegger, despite being extremely strong, could defeat Bj\u00f6rnsson in a powerlifting competition. Bj\u00f6rnsson has specialized in powerlifting and strongman competitions for many years and has set world records in these competitions. Schwarzenegger, although a legend in the bodybuilding world, does not have the same experience or focus in powerlifting as Bj\u00f6rnsson does. Hence, the correct answer is (B) no."

He did not compete in powerlifting competitions and his training focused more on hypertrophy and aesthetic muscle development rather than raw strength for the three specific lifts of powerlifting.
