Secondly, Hershey's Kisses are an American candy. So, if we combine these two pieces of information, we can conclude that it was not possible to buy Hershey's Kisses with farthings after 1960. Additionally, even if Hershey's Kisses were available in the UK, farthings would not have been a valid currency as they were not in circulation after 1956. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

Farthings were a small denomination coin used in Britain's currency system until it was discontinued in 1960. That means that farthings were not used after 1960. Hershey's Kisses, on the other hand, are a type of candy that was popularized in the United States. Hershey's Kisses have been around since 1907, and the use of red foil wrappers was introduced in 1962. Since the question specifically mentions the use of farthings after 1960, we know that the answer is no because farthings were not in circulation after 1960. Therefore, it is not possible to buy Hershey's Kisses in red foil with farthings after 1960."

Hershey's Kisses were first introduced in 1907, but the red foil was not added until the 1920s. While Hershey's Kisses have been available in a range of colors over the years, the red foil is a classic and iconic design.\n\nPutting these pieces of information together, we can determine that it would not have been possible to buy Hershey's Kisses in red foil with farthings after 1960. This is because farthings were no longer in circulation, so they would not have been accepted as payment for any goods, including Hershey's Kisses. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

So, the question is asking whether Hershey's Kisses in red foil were available for purchase using farthings after 1960. \n\nHowever, Hershey's Kisses are a product made in the United States, not in Great Britain. Therefore, farthings would not have been a form of currency accepted for purchasing Hershey's Kisses, even if they were available in red foil. \n\nAdditionally, Hershey's Kisses were not introduced in red foil until the 1980s, according to Hershey's website. Therefore, even if farthings were still in use in the United States after 1960, it would not have been possible to purchase Hershey's Kisses in red foil with them. \n\nBased on these two factors, the correct answer is (B) no."

After some research, we can find out that Hershey's Kisses were first wrapped in silver foil in 1907, but it wasn't until 1962 that they began wrapping them in different colored foils for special occasions such as Christmas and Valentine's Day. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that Hershey's Kisses may have been available in red foil after 1960, but it is highly unlikely that they were sold for farthings since the coin was no longer in circulation after 1960.
