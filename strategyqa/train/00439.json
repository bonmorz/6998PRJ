One way to do this is to visit the Orange County Government website or contact their Department of Transportation. \n\nUpon checking, we can find that Orange County does have a noise regulation program called the Airport Noise and Capacity Act (ANCA), which aims to manage noise levels around John Wayne Airport. \n\nNext, we need to see if ANCA requires airplanes to be quiet. Upon reading through the regulations, we can find that ANCA does impose noise limits on aircraft operations within certain hours of the day. \n\nSpecifically, the noise limits vary depending on the time of day and the type of aircraft, but they are generally set at levels that encourage airlines to use quieter aircraft and sufficient noise reduction technology. \n\nTherefore, we can confidently conclude that Orange County, California does require airplanes to be quiet, and the answer to the question is A-yes."
