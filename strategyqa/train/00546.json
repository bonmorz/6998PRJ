In this story, the main character Belle stumbles upon a magical castle and meets the Beast, who has been cursed as a punishment for his selfishness. As part of the curse, all of the objects in the castle are also enchanted and given personalities. This includes the talking candlestick Lumiere, the teapot Mrs. Potts, and the clock Cogsworth. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes, inanimate objects do come alive in Beauty and the Beast due to the enchantment placed upon them by the curse."

The story revolves around the relationship between the Beast and a girl named Belle, who is imprisoned in the castle where he lives. \n\nSecond, one of the central themes of Beauty and the Beast is the idea that things are not always as they seem. This is demonstrated throughout the story, particularly in the way that Belle gradually comes to see the good in the Beast, even though he is initially scary and intimidating. \n\nThird, there is a scene in the story where the Beast shows Belle a magical room full of inanimate objects that come to life, including a candlestick named Lumiere, a clock named Cogsworth, and a teapot named Mrs. Potts. These characters play an important role in the story, helping Belle and the Beast to overcome the obstacles they face, and ultimately playing a part in breaking the curse that has been placed on the Beast. \n\nSo, in answer to the question, yes, inanimate objects do come alive in Beauty and the Beast, as demonstrated by the presence of characters like Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Potts. This is an important part of the story's magical, fairy tale world, and helps to create a sense of wonder and enchantment for readers and viewers alike."

In the story, the Beast is a cursed prince who appears as a monstrous creature. He is not technically an inanimate object, but rather a living being who has been transformed by magic. However, many other objects in the Beast's castle have also been enchanted and given a kind of life through the curse.\n\nThese objects include the enchanted rose, which serves as a ticking clock for the Beast's curse. The rose petals fall one by one, and when the last one drops, the curse will become permanent unless the Beast can find true love. There are also various pieces of furniture, such as the talking teapot, Lumiere the candlestick, and Cogsworth the clock.\n\nSo, while inanimate objects do not exactly \"come alive\" in the traditional sense, they do take on human-like characteristics and personalities through the magic of the curse. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes."

The curse is such that the prince and all the inhabitants of his castle are transformed into inanimate objects (furniture, utensils, etc.).\n3. However, as the story progresses, we see that these inanimate objects come alive and interact with Belle and the Beast. For instance, the teapot and cup entertain Belle with a song, the candelabra provides light and guidance, and the wardrobe provides Belle with a gown for a special occasion.\n4. These inanimate objects have been anthropomorphized, which means they have been given human-like qualities such as emotions, personalities, and even voices.\n5.
