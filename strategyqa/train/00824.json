Next, we need to consider that newspapers are typically only distributed in the cities or regions where they are published. Since the Toronto Star is published in Toronto, it is unlikely that it would be distributed in Boston, which is located in the United States. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, someone in Boston would not receive the Toronto Star because it is not distributed in that city."

If someone in Boston wants to receive the Toronto Star, they would have to access it through online sources or international newspaper distributors. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"yes\", someone in Boston would not receive the Toronto Star. This is because the Toronto Star is not distributed locally in Boston and it is not widely available in the United States. So, the correct answer is (A)."

This means that there may be some limitations when it comes to distributing newspapers from one country to another.\n\nSo, would someone in Boston not receive the Toronto Star? The answer is yes. It would be difficult for someone in Boston to receive the Toronto Star on a regular basis, unless they have access to an international newspaper delivery service or a digital subscription.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is the correct answer as it states that someone in Boston would not receive the Toronto Star."
