The Chinese New Year calendar is also known as the Lunar New Year calendar and is based on the cycles of the moon. The calendar assigns an animal to each year in a 12-year cycle. These animals are known as the Chinese zodiac. So, for example, 2021 is the Year of the Ox.\n\nNow, we need to consider the mollusks. Mollusks are a diverse group of animals that include snails, clams, and octopuses. They are not typically considered in the Chinese zodiac calendar, which focuses on 12 animals that are important in Chinese culture (rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, as there are no mollusks on the Chinese New Year calendar."

Mollusks are a type of invertebrate animal with soft bodies, such as snails, clams, and octopuses. \n\nSo, the question is asking if there are any mollusks included in the Chinese New Year calendar. \n\nThere are actually 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac that are used to represent each year in the lunar calendar - rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. No mollusk is included in the list, so the answer is (B) no."

The Chinese New Year calendar, also known as the Lunar New Year or Spring Festival, is a traditional holiday celebrated in China and other countries in East Asia. The calendar is based on the phases of the moon and includes a cycle of 12 animals, each representing a year in the cycle.\n\nNext, we need to identify what mollusks are. Mollusks are a group of invertebrate animals that include snails, clams, squids, and octopuses.\n\nNow we can answer the question by combining these two pieces of information. The Chinese New Year calendar includes a cycle of 12 animals, and none of these animals are mollusks. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

The answer to this is no. The twelve animals in the Chinese zodiac are based on a mythological story about the Jade Emperor who called together all animals for a race. The first twelve animals that arrived at the finish line were designated to represent the twelve-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac. Mollusks, such as snails, clams, and octopuses, were not present in the race and thus were not included in the calendar.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, there are no mollusks on the Chinese New Year calendar."
