The question is asking if the goddess Friday is named after despising felines. \n\nNext, we need to analyze the answer choices. \n\nOption (A) is saying \"yes,\" which means it agrees with the statement that goddess Friday is named after despising felines. \n\nOption (B) is saying \"no,\" which means it disagrees with the statement that goddess Friday is named after despising felines. \n\nNow, we need to consider any prior knowledge we have about the topic. For example, if we know that the name \"Friday\" has no association with felines or animals in general, then we can eliminate option (A) and confidently choose option (B). Similarly, if we know that the goddess Friday is associated with a certain mythology or belief system and there is no mention of felines in her story or attributes, then we can again eliminate option (A) and choose option (B). \n\nTherefore, based on our analysis, the correct answer is option (B) - no, goddess Friday is not named after despising felines."

This sentence is grammatically incorrect, as it does not make sense in terms of word order and meaning. However, we can try to understand the intended meaning of the sentence, which is whether the goddess Friday was named after felines or not. \n\nTo answer this question, we can start by researching the origins and mythology behind the goddess Friday. After conducting research, we can find that there is no evidence or belief that the goddess Friday was named after felines or despised them in any way. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the goddess Friday is not named after despising felines. \n\nIt is important to carefully analyze and interpret the question, as well as gather relevant information, to arrive at the correct answer."

One possible interpretation of the question could be: Was the goddess Friday named after her hatred of cats?\n\nHowever, even with this interpretation, the answer would still be (B) no. There is no evidence or mythology suggesting that the goddess Friday was named after her dislike of cats. In fact, the origin of the name \"Friday\" can be traced back to the Old English word Fr\u012b\u0121ed\u00e6\u0121, meaning \"day of Frige\" (Frige being an ancient Germanic goddess of love, fertility, and marriage).\n\nFurthermore, there is no reason to assume that any ancient goddess would have a strong dislike of a particular animal without any cultural or religious significance attached to it. Therefore, the answer remains (B) no."

Assuming that it is supposed to say \"Is the goddess Friday named after cats\", we can proceed with the explanation. \n\nNext, we need to evaluate the statement \"despise felines\". This means \"to strongly dislike cats\". We are being asked whether the goddess Friday is named after such a feeling or attitude towards cats. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the origin and meaning of the name \"Friday\". Friday is actually named after the Norse goddess Frigg, who was associated with love and fertility. There is no evidence to suggest that the name Friday has anything to do with cats, or with a negative attitude towards them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) - no, the goddess Friday is not named after despising felines."
