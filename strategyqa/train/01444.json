However, being an actor has nothing to do with mastering sweep picking. \n\nNext, we need to know what sweep picking is. Sweep picking is a guitar playing technique that involves playing notes in a rapid succession using a single sweep of the picking hand across the strings. It requires a lot of practice and skill to master.\n\nSince nothing in Jeremy Irons' background or profession suggests that he has ever played the guitar or shown an interest in music, it is safe to assume that he did not master sweep picking as a child. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

Sweep picking is a guitar technique where the guitarist plays each note of a chord in a fast and fluid motion, instead of picking each individual note. \n\nNext, we need to consider who Jeremy Irons is. Jeremy Irons is an English actor, best known for his roles in movies such as \"The Lion King\" and \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\". \n\nNow, we can conclude that it is highly unlikely that Jeremy Irons mastered sweep picking as a child because Jeremy Irons is not a professional guitarist. Additionally, there is no evidence or indication that he has ever expressed an interest in or pursued guitar playing. \n\nIn the answer, option (B) is the correct answer as it is the logical conclusion based on the information provided about sweep picking and Jeremy Irons."

Nowhere in his biography or career highlights does it mention him as a musician or guitarist.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the answer to the question is (B) no - Jeremy Irons did not master sweep picking as a child, nor is it likely that he ever attempted to do so."

Sweep picking is a guitar playing technique that involves playing arpeggios with a fluid and continuous motion across the strings.

Although Jeremy Irons is a multi-talented individual and has been known to play the guitar, there is no evidence to suggest that he specifically mastered sweep picking as a child. In fact, there is very little information available about his musical background or whether he played the guitar seriously at any point in his life. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
