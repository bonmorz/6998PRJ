The question is asking whether Lines on the Antiquity of Microbes is briefer than any haiku. \n\nNext, we need to know what a haiku is. A haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry that typically consists of three lines. The first and last lines have five syllables, while the middle line has seven syllables. \n\nNow, we can focus on Lines on the Antiquity of Microbes. This is a book written by Louis Pasteur that is about the history and significance of microbes. \n\nSo, is Lines on the Antiquity of Microbes briefer than any haiku? We know that a haiku has only three lines, each with a fixed number of syllables. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that any book, including Lines on the Antiquity of Microbes, would be briefer than any haiku. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes."

What is a haiku? \nHaiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry that consists of three lines. The first and third lines contain five syllables, while the second line contains seven syllables.\n\n3. What is Lines on the Antiquity of Microbes? \nLines on the Antiquity of Microbes is a scientific paper published by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 describing his observations of microbes through his microscope.\n\n4. What does \"briefer\" mean? \nBriefer means shorter in length or duration.\n\n5. Is the question asking us if Lines on the Antiquity of Microbes is shorter in length than any haiku? \nYes, the question explicitly asks whether the paper is shorter than any haiku.\n\n6. Is the answer yes or no? \nThe answer is yes. While haikus vary in length, the maximum number of syllables in a haiku is 17, and Lines on the Antiquity of Microbes is significantly shorter than that. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that it is briefer than any haiku."
