Therefore, the answer is yes, the Riksdag is a political entity in Scandinavia."

A political entity is a government or organization that has the power to make decisions and enforce laws or rules. \n\nNow, if we combine these two pieces of information, we can say that the Riksdag is indeed a political entity in Scandinavia. It is the national legislature, which means it plays a significant role in making decisions and enforcing laws in Sweden.

The Riksdag is the national legislative assembly of Sweden, which is one of the Scandinavian countries along with Norway, Denmark, and sometimes Finland and Iceland. So, the Riksdag is a political entity in Sweden. But the question specifically asks if it is a political entity in Scandinavia as a whole. To answer this, we need to determine if the Riksdag has any influence or presence outside of Sweden. Since the Riksdag only governs Sweden and does not have any official jurisdiction or authority over the other Scandinavian countries, we can confidently say that the answer is (A) yes, the Riksdag is a political entity in Scandinavia because it is a political entity in Sweden, which is a Scandinavian country."
