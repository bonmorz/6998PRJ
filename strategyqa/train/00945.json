                "content": "First, we need to establish who James Brown is. James Brown was an American singer, songwriter, actor, dancer, and musician who passed away in 2006. We also know that he was married and divorced multiple times throughout his lifetime. \n\nNext, we need to consider what a doubles game of tennis entails. A doubles game of tennis is a match that involves four players: two on each team. The players on the same team alternate hitting the ball until one team wins a point.\n\nBased on this information, we can see that the question is asking if James Brown's ex-wives could hold a doubles game of tennis. Since the question does not specify which ex-wives are involved or if they have any experience playing tennis, we can assume that the question is asking if it's physically possible for his ex-wives to hold a doubles game of tennis. \n\nGiven this information, the answer is (A) yes. There are no physical or logistical reasons why James Brown's ex-wives couldn't hold a doubles game of tennis. As long as they have access to a tennis court, the necessary equipment, and are physically capable of playing, they could hold a doubles game of tennis."

Therefore, we can say that he has multiple ex-wives.\n\nNext, we need to determine if any of his ex-wives were tennis players. There is no information available about the tennis skills of James Brown's ex-wives. However, this is not relevant to the question, as the question is not asking about the ex-wives' tennis abilities individually.\n\nLastly, we need to confirm if James Brown's ex-wives are physically able to participate in a doubles game of tennis. Again, we have no information about the physical abilities of James Brown's ex-wives. However, assuming they are in good health and not physically impaired, we can say that they are capable of playing tennis.\n\nPutting it all together, we can say that James Brown's ex-wives, if willing and able, could hold a doubles game of tennis. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes."

James Brown was a famous singer and musician known as the \"Godfather of Soul.\" Next, we need to determine if he had ex-wives. It is a known fact that James Brown was married three times and had multiple divorces. Now, we can focus on the main question - could his ex-wives hold a doubles game of tennis? The answer is yes, as there is no reason why James Brown's ex-wives could not play tennis together. The question does not mention any specific limitations or obstacles for them to do so. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

Therefore, we can assume that the question is asking if it is possible for James Brown's ex-wives to play a doubles game of tennis together.\n\nNext, we need to determine any potential barriers to this happening. The fact that they are ex-wives is not a barrier to them playing tennis together. The only potential barrier would be if they did not know how to play tennis or did not have access to a tennis court.\n\nSince the question does not mention anything about the ex-wives' knowledge of tennis or access to a court, we can assume that they are able to play tennis and have access to a court.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes, James Brown's ex-wives could hold a doubles game of tennis."

It's important to understand that we're not being asked about their ability to play tennis or their relationship to James Brown, but simply whether they can hold a tennis game together.\n\nNext, we can consider the factors that might impact their ability to hold a doubles game of tennis. For example, do they have access to a court, racquets, and tennis balls? Is there anyone else available to play with them, or could they play against each other? All of these factors could impact their ability to hold a tennis game.\n\nHowever, none of these factors are explicitly mentioned in the question. Instead, the question simply asks whether they COULD hold a tennis game.\n\nGiven this, we can assume that the question is simply asking whether it is physically possible for James Brown's ex-wives to hold a doubles game of tennis. And the answer to that question is yes - assuming they have access to a court and tennis equipment, there's no reason why they wouldn't be able to hold a tennis game together. So the correct answer is (A) yes."
