According to online sources, he has five children. \n\nNext, we need to determine if all of his children are old enough to play a regulation game of basketball. Regulation basketball games require players to be at least 10 years old according to the International Basketball Federation (FIBA). \n\nAssuming that all of Eric Clapton's children are over 10 years old, we need to ensure that they have enough players to form two teams. A regulation game of basketball requires two teams of five players each, for a total of ten players.\n\nSince Eric Clapton has five children, we cannot form two full teams of five players each. Even if all of his children were old enough to play, we would still only have one team of five players. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, Eric Clapton's children could not play a regulation game of basketball among themselves."

Four of Clapton's children are 18 or older, which means they are likely to be physically able to play basketball. However, his youngest child is only 16. \n\nBut even if all of Clapton's children were physically able to play basketball, we don't know if they actually have a basketball hoop or court on which to play. \n\nAdditionally, we don't know if Clapton's children are interested in playing basketball. They may prefer other sports, or they may have no interest in sports at all. \n\nFinally, the question asks if Clapton's children could play a \"regulation\" game of basketball among themselves. This means that they would have to follow all of the rules and regulations of basketball, including having a certain number of players, using the correct ball, and playing on a court of the correct size. Without knowing whether Clapton's children have the necessary equipment and knowledge to play basketball according to regulation rules, we cannot confidently answer \"yes\" to this question. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

It is possible that they live in a place where there is no such facility or space available. \n\nThird, we need to know if Eric Clapton's children have the necessary skills to play basketball at a regulation level. Just because they may have played basketball before or enjoy the sport, it doesn't mean they have the skill set to play at a regulatory level. \n\nConsidering these factors, we cannot definitively say that Eric Clapton's children could play a regulation game of basketball among themselves.

According to public records, Clapton has five children. \n\nNext, we need to determine if his children are old enough to play basketball. The regulation age for basketball is typically 7-10 years old for younger leagues, and up to 18 years old for high school leagues. \n\nAssuming all of Clapton's children are within this age range, we can move on to the next factor: do they have a regulation basketball court to play on? It's possible that Clapton has a basketball court on his property or access to one, but without that, the answer is already leaning towards no. \n\nFinally, even if Clapton's children have a court to play on, we need to consider if they have enough players to form a team to play a regulation game against each other. A regulation game of basketball typically requires five players on each team. \n\nSo, based on the information we have gathered, it is unlikely that Eric Clapton's children could play a regulation game of basketball among themselves, making the answer to the question no (B)."

This would require a sufficiently large number of players, ideally 5 on each team, who are all skilled enough to play basketball at a regulation level. \n\nGiven that we have no information about the basketball skills of Eric Clapton's children, we cannot confidently say that they could play a regulation game among themselves.
