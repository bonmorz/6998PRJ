Casio was founded in 1946. \nSecondly, we need to determine whether 1946 is a composite number or not. \nTo do this, we need to know the definition of a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has more factors than just 1 and itself. \nTo check if 1946 is a composite number, we need to find its factors. \nWe can start by dividing 1946 by 2. 1946 divided by 2 is 973. \nNext, we can try dividing 1946 by 3. However, 3 does not divide into 1946 evenly. \nWe can continue trying to divide 1946 by higher numbers, but we will eventually find that it is divisible by 2 and 7. \nTherefore, 1946 has more factors than just 1 and itself, making it a composite number. \nThus, the answer is (A) yes, Casio's founding year is a composite number."

In other words, it can be divided by more than just 1 and itself.\n3. Casio's founding year is the year in which the company was established. According to the company's official website, Casio was founded in 1946.\n4. To determine if 1946 is a composite number, we need to find its factors. One way to do this is to divide 1946 by every number between 1 and 1946 and see which ones divide evenly.\n5. This is a time-consuming process, so we can use some shortcuts. For example, we know that every even number greater than 2 is composite, because it is divisible by 2. We can also look at the last digit of a number to see if it is divisible by 5.\n6. In this case, we can see that 1946 is an even number greater than 2, so it is composite. We could also calculate its prime factorization, which is 2 x 971. This shows that 1946 can be divided by more than just 1 and itself, making it a composite number.\n7. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, Casio's founding year is a composite number."
