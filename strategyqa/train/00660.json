However, for the sake of answering the question, we can assume that they exist. \n\nNow, we need to compare the altitudes at which King Kong and Eiffel Tower visitors were climbing. The Eiffel Tower is 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall, and visitors can climb up to the third platform, which is at a height of 276 meters (905 feet). \n\nOn the other hand, King Kong is a giant gorilla who has been depicted as climbing tall buildings such as the Empire State Building and the World Trade Center in movies. These buildings are more than 400 meters tall, so it's safe to assume that King Kong was climbing at a much higher altitude than the Eiffel Tower visitors. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, King Kong was climbing at a higher altitude than Eiffel Tower visitors."

The Eiffel Tower has a fixed height of 324 meters (1,063 feet), and visitors can only climb up to the second floor, which is 115 meters (377 feet) high. \n\nOn the other hand, King Kong is a fictional character, and his height can vary depending on the version. However, typically, he is depicted as a giant ape, at least several times taller than a regular human. \n\nTherefore, if we assume that King Kong is climbing a tall building, he would be at a higher altitude than Eiffel Tower visitors, who reach only the second floor. Even if he is climbing a building that is lower than the Eiffel Tower but still taller than 115 meters, he would still be at a higher altitude than the visitors. \n\nThus, the correct answer is (A) yes."
