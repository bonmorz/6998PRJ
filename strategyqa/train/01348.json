So, it is possible for her to have been alive during the time the play was written. \n\nMoreover, the play was performed at least twice, once in 1594 and then again in 1599. Elizabeth I was still alive in 1594 and would have been 61 at the time of the second performance in 1599. As the Queen was known to be a patron of the arts, it is highly possible that she would have attended one of these performances of the play. \n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that Elizabeth I of England could have seen the play Dido, Queen of Carthage."

                "content": "First, we need to know when the play was written and performed. Dido, Queen of Carthage was written by Christopher Marlowe and performed by the Admiral's Men, one of the leading acting companies in London in the late 16th century. The play was first performed in 1587 or 1588, during the reign of Elizabeth I. So, we know that the play was performed during Elizabeth I's reign.\n\nThe next question is whether Elizabeth I attended theatrical performances. The answer is yes. Elizabeth I was known to enjoy plays, and she regularly attended performances at court. In fact, she was a patron of the arts and supported many playwrights and actors during her reign.\n\nBased on these facts, we can conclude that it is quite possible that Elizabeth I saw the play Dido, Queen of Carthage. As the play was performed during her reign and she was known to attend theatrical performances, it is likely that she would have had the opportunity to see it. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

The play was written by Christopher Marlowe and published in 1594, which coincided with Elizabeth I's reign from 1558 to 1603. Therefore, it is possible that the play was performed during her lifetime.\n\nNext, we need to determine whether Elizabeth I was a patron of the arts and specifically supported theater during her reign. Elizabeth I was known to be a great supporter of the arts and literature, including the theater. She was known to have attended many performances and even encouraged her courtiers to write plays and perform them for her. Therefore, it is highly possible that she could have seen a performance of Dido, Queen of Carthage.\n\nTaking these factors into account, the answer is \"yes\", Elizabeth I of England could have seen the play Dido, Queen of Carthage."

This is right in the middle of Elizabeth's reign as queen, so it is certainly plausible that the play would have been performed during her lifetime. \n\nThirdly, we know that Elizabeth was a patron of the arts and supported the theatre, so it is also plausible that she would have attended a performance of the play. \n\nPutting these three pieces of information together, we can conclude that it is indeed possible that Elizabeth I of England could have seen the play Dido, Queen of Carthage.

Dido, Queen of Carthage was written by Christopher Marlowe and performed for the first time in 1594. \n\nSince the play was performed during Elizabeth I's reign, it is possible that she could have seen it.
