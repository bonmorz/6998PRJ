When was the first device capable of recording sound invented? \n- The first device capable of recording sound, the phonautograph, was invented in 1857. This technology involved etching sound waves onto a glass plate but did not include the ability to play back the sound.\n3. When was the first device capable of recording and playing back sound invented? \n- The first device capable of recording and playing back sound was the phonograph, invented by Thomas Edison in 1877.\n4. Based on this timeline, could George Washington's speeches have been recorded live onto a compact disc? \n- No, because compact discs were not invented until the 1980s, and the technology to record sound did not exist during George Washington's lifetime. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

During this time, there was no technology available to record live speeches to a compact disc. The first gramophone was invented in the late 1800s and the first compact disc was invented in 1965. So, the answer is no, George Washington's speeches could not have been recorded live to a compact disc because the technology did not exist during his time."
