A bar mitzvah is a Jewish coming-of-age ceremony for boys, typically held when they turn 13 years old. \n\nCharlemagne, on the other hand, was not Jewish. He was a Christian king and a ruler of the Franks, a Germanic tribe in the 8th and 9th centuries. \n\nAdditionally, bar mitzvahs did not become a widespread practice until the Middle Ages, long after Charlemagne's death. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, Charlemagne did not have a bar mitzvah."

He was not Jewish, nor did he practice Judaism. Therefore, it is safe to assume that he did not have a bar mitzvah.\n\nFurthermore, the bar mitzvah is a relatively modern tradition, dating back to the medieval period. While there were certainly Jewish coming-of-age ceremonies in earlier times, they were not standardized or formalized in the same way. Charlemagne lived long before the bar mitzvah tradition as we know it today ever existed, so this question is not particularly relevant in his case."
