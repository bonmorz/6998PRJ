Rand Paul is a politician from the United States, who currently serves as a United States Senator from Kentucky. \n\nSecondly, we need to know where Lake Michigan is located. Lake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes of North America, and it is located entirely within the United States, bordering the states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. \n\nThirdly, we are asked whether Rand Paul frequently swam in Lake Michigan during his undergraduate years. Rand Paul completed his undergraduate studies at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, which is not close to Lake Michigan. Therefore, it is unlikely that he swam in Lake Michigan during his undergraduate years. \n\nBased on these facts, we can conclude that the answer is (B) no, Rand Paul did not frequently swim in Lake Michigan during his undergraduate years."
