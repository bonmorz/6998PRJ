According to standard measurements, a king size bed is approximately 76 inches wide and 80 inches long. \n\nNext, we need to consider the size of newborn American Black Bear cubs. On average, black bear cubs weigh between 8-12 ounces at birth and are approximately 9-12 inches in length. \n\nAssuming the cubs are lying down with their bodies parallel to the width of the bed, we can calculate the total width needed. Adding the length of each cub (12 inches) together, we get a total length of 24 inches. \n\nSince the bed is 76 inches wide, there is more than enough space for the cubs to fit side by side. \n\nThus, the answer is (A) yes, two newborn American Black Bear cubs could fit on a king size bed."

According to sources, the average weight of a newborn American Black Bear cub is around 8 to 12 ounces, and the average length is around 8 to 12 inches.\n\nSo, two newborn American Black Bear cubs combined would weigh approximately 16 to 24 ounces and measure a total of 16 to 24 inches in length. \n\nComparing this to the size of the king size bed, it is clear that two newborn American Black Bear cubs could easily fit on the bed side by side, with plenty of space to spare. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes."

On average, a king size bed is approximately 76 inches wide and 80 inches long. \n\nTo determine if the two newborn American Black Bear cubs could fit on the bed, we need to calculate the combined length and width of the two cubs. \n\nAssuming the two cubs are lying next to each other, their combined length would be approximately 16 inches (8 inches + 8 inches). Since the bed is 80 inches long, there is plenty of room for the cubs to fit lengthwise on the bed. \n\nNext, we need to calculate the width of the two cubs. Assuming each cub is around 6 inches wide (8 inches length minus 2 inches for the width of the cub), the total width of the two cubs side by side would be around 12 inches. Since the bed is 76 inches wide, there is also plenty of room for the cubs to fit widthwise on the bed. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that two newborn American Black Bear cubs can fit on a king size bed, making the answer (A) yes."

According to research, they typically weigh between 8-12 ounces and measure about 8-10 inches long. Next, we need to know the size of a king-size bed. A standard king-size bed in the United States measures approximately 76 inches wide by 80 inches long.\n\nBased on this information, we can estimate that the two newborn American Black Bear cubs would easily fit on a king-size bed. Even if they were laying side-by-side, they would take up only around 20 inches in length, leaving ample room for the rest of the bed. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

According to the National Park Service, newborn American Black Bear cubs are usually around 8-12 inches (20-30cm) long and weigh around half a pound to a pound (0.2-0.5 kg).\nNext, we need to know the size of a king size bed. According to the Better Sleep Council, a king size bed is usually around 76 inches (193cm) wide and 80 inches (203cm) long.\nSo, if we place the two newborn American Black Bear cubs side by side on the bed, each cub would take up around 12 inches (30cm). Therefore, the two cubs would take up a total of 24 inches (60cm) on the width of the bed.\nSince the width of the bed is 76 inches (193cm), we can fit the two cubs with extra room to spare. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, two newborn American Black Bear cubs could fit on a king size bed."
