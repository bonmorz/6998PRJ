Kate Gosselin is a reality TV personality who has 8 children, who are twins and sextuplets. Assuming that Kate's household only includes her and her 8 children, the total number of people in her household is 9. \n\nSince a Bandy team requires at least 11 players, and Kate Gosselin's household only has 9 people, the answer to the question \"Can Kate Gosselin's household fill out a Bandy team?\" is no, it cannot fill out a Bandy team."

Bandy is a winter sport similar to ice hockey, but played on a larger ice surface with different rules and equipment. A Bandy team typically consists of 11 players (10 field players and 1 goalkeeper) on the ice. \n\nNow, let's look at Kate Gosselin's household. She is a reality TV star who is famously known for having eight children (two sets of multiples - sextuplets and twins). While having a large family, it's highly unlikely that all of them would be able to play Bandy due to the following reasons:\n\n1. Age: Some of her children may be too young to play the sport or physically unable to play.\n\n2. Skill: Not everyone has the ability to play a sport, and playing Bandy requires a certain level of skill and experience.\n\n3. Interest: Even if some of them may be physically and mentally capable of playing Bandy, they may not have an interest in the sport.\n\nThus, based on these reasons, we can conclude that Kate Gosselin's household cannot fill out a Bandy team. Hence, the answer is (B) no."
