ANA is a Japanese airline, so we can assume that its headquarters is located in Japan. \n\nNext, we need to determine whether there is a beach near the location of ANA's headquarters. To do this, we can research the location of ANA's headquarters and any nearby beaches. A quick Google search reveals that ANA's headquarters is located in Tokyo, which is a large city and not situated directly on the coast. While there may be beaches in the greater Tokyo area, they are not considered to be very close to the city center where ANA's headquarters is located.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the answer is (B) no, the headquarters of All Nippon Airways are not near a beach."
