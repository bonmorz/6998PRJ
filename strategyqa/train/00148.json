He is mainly known for writing a book, De Materia Medica, which is a comprehensive encyclopedia on herbal medicine. \n\nBased on this information, we can now answer the question. The question asks whether Dioskourides was a lapidary. There is no evidence to suggest that Dioskourides worked as a lapidary or had any interest in working with stones or gems for decorative purposes. Therefore, the answer is no, he was not a lapidary.

Next, we need to know who Dioskourides is. Dioskourides was a Greek physician, pharmacologist, and botanist who lived in the first century AD. He wrote a famous five-volume encyclopaedia of herbal medicine, known as De Materia Medica. Now that we understand both terms, we can answer the question. Since Dioskourides was primarily known for his work in medicine and botany, and there is no record of him being a lapidary, we can conclude that the answer is (B) no. However, since the question asks if he was a lapidary and not about his other areas of expertise, we cannot be certain of the answer without further historical evidence."

He is famous for writing De Materia Medica, a five-volume book about the medicinal properties of various plants, animals, and minerals.\n\nNext, we need to know what a lapidary is. A lapidary is someone who works with precious stones, cutting and polishing them for use in jewelry.\n\nNow, we can answer the question. There is no direct evidence to suggest that Dioskourides worked as a lapidary. Based on his profession as a physician and pharmacologist, it is unlikely that he spent much time cutting and polishing stones. Therefore, the answer is (B) no. \n\nHowever, there is something worth mentioning: Dioskourides does mention the use of stones in his book as medicinal substances. For example, he recommends the use of powdered emerald to treat eye problems, and powdered sapphire to treat headaches. While this does not mean that Dioskourides was a lapidary himself, it does show that he had knowledge of and experience with precious stones."
