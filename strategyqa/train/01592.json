Astrology is the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial objects as a means of divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Physics, on the other hand, is the branch of science concerned with the study of matter and energy and their interactions.\n\nNext, we need to consider Elon Musk's background and interests. Elon Musk is known for his involvement in technology, engineering, and entrepreneurship. He is the founder of several companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, which are focused on space exploration and electric cars.\n\nGiven his background, it is more likely that Elon Musk would know about physics than astrology. Physics is directly relevant to his work and interests, while astrology is not. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

Astrology is the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial bodies, which is believed by some to have an effect on human affairs and the natural world. On the other hand, physics is the branch of science concerned with the nature and properties of matter and energy. \n\nNow, let's think about Elon Musk. He is a well-known entrepreneur and business magnate who is mainly involved in the technology industry. His companies, such as SpaceX and Tesla, are focused on space exploration, renewable energy, and electric cars. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that Elon Musk is more likely to have knowledge and expertise in physics rather than astrology. This is because physics aligns with the fields in which he is actively involved, whereas astrology is not typically relevant to his work or businesses. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Elon Musk would not be more likely to know about astrology than physics."

Elon Musk is famously known for his companies, like SpaceX and Tesla, which are focused on space exploration and advanced technology. A large part of his work requires extensive knowledge of engineering, mathematics, physics, and science in general. \n\nTherefore, given his background and expertise, it is highly unlikely that Musk would have spent significant time studying astrology, which is not a scientific discipline and has little relevance to space exploration and advanced technology.
