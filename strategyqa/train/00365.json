The 1908 US presidential election took place before this time period, therefore it would have been impossible for the Democratic Party's nominee to have watched TV. Additionally, it is not known with certainty who the nominee was in 1908, as more than one person could have been considered for the position at the time. However, regardless of who the nominee was, it is safe to say that they did not have access to television during their campaign. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no."

We can get this information from various sources, including history books and websites.
