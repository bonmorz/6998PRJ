Pearl Harbor is a U.S. naval base located in Hawaii, and the attack on it by the Japanese army occurred on December 7th, 1941.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the Pearl Harbor attack did not occur during the autumn season. December falls within the winter season, which comes after fall/autumn. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
