A good role model is someone who behaves in a way that is positive, responsible, and inspirational, and who can be looked up to by others as a model for their own behavior.\n\nNow let's look at Robert Downey Jr. as a young man. In his early years, Downey Jr. struggled with drug addiction and had multiple run-ins with the law. He was arrested multiple times for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia, and was even sentenced to a year in jail in 1999.\n\nThese actions do not align with what makes a good role model. Drug addiction and criminal behavior are not things that should be promoted or admired. While Downey Jr. has since turned his life around and become a successful actor and philanthropist, his behavior as a young man does not qualify him as a good role model during that time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Robert Downey Jr. was not a good role model as a young man due to his struggles with drug addiction and criminal behavior."
