He believed that violence only perpetuates more violence and that true change comes through spiritual transformation and inner peace.\n\nTherefore, based on his beliefs and teachings, it is highly unlikely that George Fox would have supported stoning as a form of punishment. The answer is (B) no."

This means that he had a strong personal philosophy and set of beliefs that he followed.\n\nNext, what is stoning? Stoning is a form of punishment where a group or community throws stones at a convicted individual until they die.\n\nNow, knowing that George Fox was a religious leader who founded the Quaker movement, we can infer that he most likely would not support stoning. This is because Quakers are known for their commitment to non-violence and a belief in the inherent worth of every individual. Stoning, as a violent act that results in death, would be in direct conflict with these beliefs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, George Fox would not support stoning."
