Is a bengal fox likely to see the Superbowl? \n\nBased on what we know about bengal foxes and the Superbowl, the answer is (B) no. Bengal foxes are wild animals that live in their natural habitat and are not known to watch television or be interested in human events like the Superbowl."

Based on these facts, we can say that it is highly unlikely that a bengal fox would see the Superbowl.

The Superbowl is a major sporting event for football fans in the US and is broadcasted on national television.\n\nNow, coming back to the question - Is a bengal fox likely to see the Superbowl? It is highly unlikely that a bengal fox will see the Superbowl. Firstly, bengal foxes are not found in the United States and hence not likely to have access to US television. Additionally, bengal foxes are wild animals and do not have the cognitive capability to understand human traditions or entertainment events such as the Superbowl.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) \"no,\" since it is highly unlikely that a bengal fox will see the Superbowl."

It is usually held in late January or early February each year.\n\nBased on these two pieces of information, we can conclude that a Bengal fox is not likely to see the Superbowl.
