Walt Disney began working as an illustrator in the 1920s, a time when email did not exist. So, to begin with, it is unlikely that Walt Disney was able to email his illustrations as email technology had not yet been developed.\n\nEmail was first invented in the early 1960s, by Ray Tomlinson, a computer engineer. By this time, Walt Disney had passed away (in 1966). Therefore, even if email technology was available during Walt Disney's lifetime, he would not have been able to use it.\n\nIn summary, it is safe to conclude that Walt Disney was not able to email his illustrations to people living far away during his lifetime. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no."

Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Walt Disney was able to email his illustrations to people living far away during his lifetime, making answer (B) the correct response."

Walt Disney lived from 1901 to 1966, during a time when email did not yet exist. Therefore, it is unlikely that he was able to email his illustrations to people who lived far away.\n\nSecondly, we need to consider the technology available for sharing illustrations during Disney's time. In the early part of his career, he likely would have had to physically mail his illustrations to clients or colleagues. Later on, he may have used telegraph or telephone to communicate over long distances, but these methods would still not allow for the instant transmission of digital files like email does today.\n\nFinally, even if Disney had access to email technology, it would not have been widely used until the late 20th century, which is after his death in 1966. Therefore, we can confidently answer that the correct answer is (B) no, Walt Disney was not able to email his illustrations to people living far away."

Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Walt Disney was able to email his illustrations to people living far away. Additionally, even if we consider the possibility of time travel and assume that Walt Disney exists in the present day, it is still not possible to email illustrations if he did not have access to technology such as a computer, scanner, and internet connection.

Therefore, the answer is likely to be no. \n\nTo further confirm this, we can consider the fact that illustrations are typically physical drawings or paintings on paper or canvas. Email is a digital form of communication that relies on computers and the internet to transfer information. Therefore, it would not have been possible for Walt Disney to email his illustrations in the way we understand it today. \n\nAdditionally, we can consider the technological limitations of the time. Even if someone wanted to send a digital image via email, the technology required to scan and upload the physical artwork would not have been widely available or accessible to the general public. \n\nTherefore, based on these reasons, we can confidently conclude that the answer is no, Walt Disney was not able to email his illustrations to people living far away."
