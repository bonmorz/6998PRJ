According to Apple's website, the first generation iPhone had storage options of 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB. \n\nNext, we need to find out how much space an average lolcat meme takes up. This can vary depending on the image size and quality, but let's assume an average lolcat image is around 500KB in size. \n\nTo figure out how many lolcats can fit on the iPhone, we need to do some math. We'll use the 16GB iPhone as an example. \n\n16GB = 16,000MB \n\n16,000MB / 500KB = 32,000 \n\nSo, the 16GB iPhone could fit 32,000 lolcats. \n\nSince the question asks if a hundred thousand lolcats could fit, the answer is yes. It would take approximately 3.125 16GB iPhones to store 100,000 lolcats (100,000 / 32,000 = 3.125)."
