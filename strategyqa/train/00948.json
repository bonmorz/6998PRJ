The Hunger Games is a dystopian novel written by Suzanne Collins that was published in 2008. It is set in a futuristic society where a yearly event involving teenagers who fight till death as the ultimate form of entertainment for the ruling class.\n\nNow, we can use this information to answer the question.

Next, we need to know what The Hunger Games is. It is a popular young adult dystopian novel series, set in a post-apocalyptic world where children from different districts are forced to fight to the death as part of a televised event.\n\nNow, we can compare the two works of literature.

Wodehouse's writing focused on witty social commentary and absurd situations, while The Hunger Games deals with much darker themes such as violence, oppression, and corruption.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently answer that the correct answer is (B) no, as it is highly unlikely that P.
