The piercing can hit teeth while eating or talking and cause chipping, cracking, or other damage. This damage can lead to a need for dental work, which can be expensive. \n\nSecond, lip piercings can also increase the risk of infection in the mouth. Infections can lead to gum disease and tooth decay, which can also require dental work. \n\nLastly, the jewelry in a lip piercing can also cause damage to teeth over time. The constant rubbing of the jewelry against teeth can wear down the enamel, leading to tooth sensitivity and decay. \n\nTherefore, it is safe to say that having lip piercings can lead to more expensive dental bills, and the answer is (A) yes."
