Jalapeno is a common chili pepper that is usually considered moderately hot, while Bhut jolokia (also known as ghost pepper) is one of the hottest chili peppers in the world.\n\nNow, the question asks whether jalapeno heat is outclassed by Bhut jolokia. This means we need to compare the heat levels of these two chili peppers to see which one is hotter.\n\nStudies have shown that Bhut jolokia is much hotter than jalapeno. Bhut jolokia measures around 1,041,427 Scoville Heat Units (SHU), while jalapeno measures around 2,500-8,000 SHU. This means that Bhut jolokia is more than 100 times hotter than jalapeno.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, jalapeno heat is outclassed by Bhut jolokia."

It has a moderate amount of heat, which ranges from 2,500 to 8,000 on the Scoville scale (a measure of spicy heat). Bhut jolokia, on the other hand, is also known as the ghost pepper and is one of the hottest chili peppers in the world. It has a Scoville rating of over 1 million, which is significantly hotter than jalapeno.\n\nWith this information, we can conclude that the answer to the question is (A) yes, jalapeno heat is outclassed by Bhut jolokia. This is because Bhut jolokia is much hotter than jalapeno and has a much higher Scoville rating. So, if you compare the heat level of these two chili peppers, Bhut jolokia definitely outclasses jalapeno."
