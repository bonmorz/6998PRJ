Nobunaga's Ambition is a video game series that is set in feudal Japan, specifically during the Sengoku period. The lead character in Nobunaga's Ambition is Oda Nobunaga, a historical figure who was born and lived in Japan. Therefore, we can conclude that the lead character in Nobunaga's Ambition is Japanese.\n\nNext, we need to determine the nationality of the main character in Rurouni Kenshin. Rurouni Kenshin, also known as Samurai X, is a manga and anime series that is set in Japan during the Meiji Restoration. The main character in Rurouni Kenshin is Himura Kenshin, a former assassin who also happens to be of Japanese nationality.\n\nSince both Nobunaga's Ambition and Rurouni Kenshin are set in Japan and have lead characters who are of Japanese nationality, the answer to the question is (A) yes, Rurouni Kenshin is from the same country as the lead character in Nobunaga's Ambition."
