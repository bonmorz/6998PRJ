It is often associated with hip-hop culture and involves acrobatic and athletic moves such as spins, flips, and freezes. \n\nNow let's consider the timeframe of World War II. World War II took place from 1939 to 1945. This means that if breakdancing had grown in popularity during this time, it would have had to occur within this timeframe. \n\nHowever, as previously stated, breakdancing did not originate until the 1970s, which is several decades after World War II ended. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, breakdancing did not grow in popularity during World War II because it did not exist at that time."
