The Peak of the Andes is a mountain range in South America, while the Colossus of Rhodes was a statue of the Greek god Helios built on the island of Rhodes in the 3rd century BC. \n\nNow, we need to consider the physical locations of these two landmarks. The Peak of the Andes is located in South America, while the Colossus of Rhodes was located on the island of Rhodes in the Aegean Sea. These two locations are far away from each other, separated by thousands of miles.\n\nGiven this distance, it is highly unlikely that the colossus could see the peak at all. Even if the colossus did have a view of the peak, it would have been obstructed by the curvature of the Earth, as well as other geographical features such as hills, mountains, and forests.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d the Peak of the Andes was hidden from the view of the Colossus of Rhodes."

The statue was built between 292 and 280 BCE and was destroyed by an earthquake in 226 BCE. Meanwhile, the Peak of the Andes is the highest peak in South America and measures 22,838 feet. So, it's evident that these two landmarks are located at a considerable distance from each other.\n\nHowever, if we consider several other factors such as the curvature of the earth and the distance between Rhodes and the Andes, it is reasonable to assume that the Peak of the Andes would be hidden from the view of the Colossus of Rhodes. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to this question is (A) Yes, the Peak of the Andes was hidden from the view of the Colossus of Rhodes."

From the location of the Colossus of Rhodes, which was situated at the entrance of the harbor of Rhodes, it is highly unlikely that one could see the Peak of the Andes due to the large distance between the two locations and the curvature of the Earth. \n\nFinally, historical evidence supports the fact that the Peak of the Andes was not discovered until the 17th century when European explorers arrived in South America, whereas the Colossus of Rhodes existed in ancient times. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the Peak of the Andes was hidden from the view of the Colossus of Rhodes. \n\nThus, the correct answer is (A) yes."

The Andes is a mountain range that runs through several countries in South America, including Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. \n\nFinally, we need to determine whether the Peak of the Andes would have been visible from the location of the Colossus of Rhodes. This is unlikely because the Colossus of Rhodes was located on an island in Greece, which is thousands of miles away from the Andes.

The distance between the two landmarks is vast, with the Andes being located on a completely different continent. Additionally, the height of the Peak of the Andes is significantly greater than that of the Colossus, making it unlikely that the statue would have been able to see it from such a great distance. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes."
