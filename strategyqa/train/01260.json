Since this question is comparing the longevity of Northwest Airlines and Betty White, we can assume it refers to the length of time each entity has been in existence. \n\nNorthwest Airlines was founded on September 1, 1926, and merged with Delta Airlines on October 29, 2008. Based on these dates, we can calculate that Northwest Airlines existed for approximately 82 years. \n\nIn comparison, Betty White, born on January 17, 1922, is currently 99 years old as of the time of writing. Therefore, Betty White's longevity (her lifespan so far) has surpassed Northwest Airlines' existence by 17 years. \n\nThus, the answer to the question is (B) no, Northwest Airlines' longevity did not surpass Betty White's."

In this context, it likely refers to the length of time that Northwest Airlines and Betty White were in existence or active within their respective industries.\n\nNext, we need to determine the timeline for each entity. Northwest Airlines was founded in 1926 and merged with Delta Air Lines in 2010, meaning it was operational for a total of 84 years. Betty White was born in 1922 and is still active in the entertainment industry today, meaning she has been active for at least 99 years.\n\nBased on this information, we can see that Betty White's longevity surpasses that of Northwest Airlines, as she has been active for a longer period of time.

Northwest Airlines was a major American airline that operated from 1926 to 2010, which means its longevity is calculated to be 84 years. Whereas, Betty White is an American actress, comedian, and television personality who was born on January 17, 1922, and is still alive as of 2021, which means her longevity is currently 99 years.\n\nNow coming back to the question, it is asking if the longevity of Northwest Airlines surpassed the longevity of Betty White. As we just established, Betty White's longevity is currently at 99 years, and Northwest Airlines' longevity is 84 years. Therefore, it is evident that Betty White's longevity has surpassed that of Northwest Airlines, and the answer is (B) no.\n\nTo summarize, the correct answer to this question is (B) no because the longevity of Northwest Airlines is 84 years, whereas Betty White's longevity is currently at 99 years, indicating that Betty White has lived longer than Northwest Airlines has existed."
