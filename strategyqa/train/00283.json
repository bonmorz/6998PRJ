On average, a single pea weighs around 0.1 grams. Based on these figures, we can see that the weight of the pea is much heavier than the bee hummingbird.

Although the weight of a pea can vary, on average, a single pea weighs about 0.1 grams. \n\nTherefore, if we place a single pea on a scale and ask if a bee hummingbird can balance it, the answer would be no.

A pea typically weighs around 0.1-0.2 ounces or 2-4 grams. \n\nConsidering the weight of the pea and the weight range of the bee hummingbird, it is highly unlikely that a bee hummingbird could balance a scale with a single pea on it. Even if the bee hummingbird attempted to lift the pea, it would be too heavy for its tiny body to manage. \n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (B) no, a bee hummingbird could not balance a scale with a single pea on it."

According to research, the average weight of a bee hummingbird is approximately 2.6 grams. \n\nNext, we need to consider the weight of a pea. The average weight of a single pea is approximately 0.1 grams. \n\nNow, let's imagine placing a single pea on one side of a scale and a bee hummingbird on the other side of the scale. The weight of the pea is significantly less than the weight of the bird. Therefore, the bird's weight would significantly outweigh the pea, and it wouldn't be able to balance the scale. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, a bee hummingbird could not balance a scale with a single pea on it."
