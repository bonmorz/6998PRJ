Babies at that age typically do not have significant facial hair growth.\n\nHowever, if we expand the definition of \"baby\" to include toddlers and young children, then the answer could potentially be yes. In some rare cases, children can develop a condition called hypertrichosis, which causes excessive hair growth all over the body, including the face. This condition is sometimes referred to as \"werewolf syndrome.\"\n\nAdditionally, in some cultures, it is customary to apply henna or other temporary dyes to a baby's face as a form of decoration. This could potentially include drawing a \"moustache\" on the baby's upper lip.\n\nSo, ultimately, while the answer to this question may seem surprising, it is possible for a baby to have a \"moustache\" in certain circumstances."

This can result in hair growth on the upper lip, resembling a mustache. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes, a baby has had a mustache, but it is an extremely rare occurrence."

It is highly unusual for a baby to have a moustache as babies do not possess the level of hormones required for the growth of facial hair. However, in rare cases, some medical conditions may cause a baby to develop a temporary or permanent form of facial hair growth. \n\nThus, based on the possibility of these medical conditions, the answer to the question is (A) yes, a baby has had a moustache before, although it is very rare."

This is where it gets a little tricky. While there may not be any widespread reports of babies having a full-blown mustache, there have been instances of babies being born with a tuft of hair above their upper lip, which can resemble a small mustache. So while it may not be a common occurrence, it is possible for a baby to have a mustache (even if it's a small one). \nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes."
