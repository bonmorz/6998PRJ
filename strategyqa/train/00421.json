It was first celebrated in 1970 and has since become a global event. \n\nNext, let's examine the term \"ceremonial tire fire.\" A tire fire refers to the burning of tires, which can release harmful chemicals and pollutants into the air. A ceremonial tire fire, therefore, would imply that burning tires is being done as part of a ritual or ceremony. \n\nNow, we can answer the question. Is it likely that people celebrate Earth Day by burning tires as part of a ceremonial ritual? The answer is no. Earth Day is a day dedicated to promoting environmental protection, and burning tires is not only harmful to the environment but also contradicts the message of Earth Day. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

It is a day focused on environmental awareness and encourages people to take action to protect the planet.\n\nNow, let's consider the idea of a ceremonial tire fire. This involves lighting a large pile of tires on fire as part of a ceremony or celebration.\n\nWhile some cultures or communities may have unique traditions or practices, a ceremonial tire fire is not a common or recommended way to celebrate Earth Day. In fact, burning tires can release harmful chemicals and pollutants into the air and soil, which goes directly against the purpose of Earth Day.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, people do not celebrate Earth Day with a ceremonial tire fire. Instead, they might participate in activities such as planting trees, cleaning up litter, reducing energy usage, or attending environmental events and festivals."

Earth Day is an annual event celebrated on April 22 to raise awareness about environmental issues and promote sustainability. Next, we need to understand what a ceremonial tire fire is. A tire fire is a type of fire that involves burning rubber tires. A ceremonial tire fire may be a ritualistic or symbolic burning of tires. \n\nBased on this information, we can determine that it is highly unlikely for people to celebrate Earth Day with a ceremonial tire fire. This is because Earth Day is focused on promoting sustainability and reducing pollution, whereas burning tires releases harmful pollutants into the air and contributes to environmental degradation. Additionally, there are no records of people celebrating Earth Day with a tire fire, and promoting such an activity would contradict the purpose of the holiday. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, people do not celebrate Earth Day with a ceremonial tire fire."
