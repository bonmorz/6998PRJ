In the United States, the legal voting age was 21 until March 29th, 1971, when the 26th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified, lowering the voting age to 18.\n4. This means that when her second child was born in January 1970, Aretha Franklin would have been 27 years old and therefore eligible to vote.\n5. However, the question is asking specifically about whether she could vote when her second child was born, not whether she was eligible to vote at some point in her life. So we need to make sure that she could vote specifically at the time of her child's birth.\n6. The 1970 midterm elections were held on November 3rd, 1970. If Aretha Franklin's child was born before this date, then she would have been able to vote in those elections. If her child was born after this date, she would not have been able to vote until the next election cycle, which would have been in 1972.\n7. Unfortunately, we do not have specific information about the exact date of Edward Franklin's birth, so we cannot say for certain whether Aretha Franklin could vote when her second child was born.\n8. However, since the answer choices only give us two options and one of them is \"no,\" we can assume that the question is asking us to make a judgment based on whatever information we do have, and in this case the safest assumption is that she could not, since we know that the earliest possible date for her to have voted after her child's birth was in November 1970, and we do not know the actual date of the birth."

In 1964, the voting age was 21 years old. This means that only those who were 21 years or older were eligible to vote in the presidential election. \n\nSince Aretha Franklin was only 22 years old at the time, she would have been eligible to vote in the election if she had turned 21 before the election. However, since she was not yet 21 at the time of the election, she would not have been able to vote.

Assuming that her child was born after the minimum voting age of 18, we can start with the year of her second child's birth and work backwards to determine if she would have been eligible to vote.\n\nFor example, if her child was born in 1970, we know that Aretha Franklin would have been at least 18 years old in 1968. However, if we look at the history of voting rights in the United States, we know that many African Americans (particularly in the South) were denied the right to vote due to discriminatory voting laws, practices, and attitudes. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 had just been passed, but its enforcement was incomplete and subject to legal challenges.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that Aretha Franklin would not have been able to vote for a president in 1968 or any year before it, due to racial discrimination and obstacles to Black voter registration and participation. The question is meant to test knowledge of history and social justice rather than specific biographical information about Aretha Franklin."

Aretha gave birth to her second child, a son named Ted White Jr., in 1964. \n\nNext, we need to know the minimum age requirement for voting during that time period. Prior to 1971, the minimum voting age was 21 years old. This means that Aretha would need to be at least 21 years old in order to vote. \n\nAretha Franklin was born on March 25, 1942, which means that in 1964 when her second child was born, she would have been 22 years old. Therefore, she would have been eligible to vote in the presidential election of 1964. \n\nHowever, we must consider an additional factor. Aretha was born in Memphis, Tennessee and moved to Detroit, Michigan before the age of 18. At the time of her second child's birth, Aretha would have still been living in Detroit. This means that she would need to have met the residency requirements for voting in Michigan in order to be eligible to participate in the election. \n\nIn Michigan, the residency requirement for voting is 30 days prior to the election. The 1964 presidential election was held on November 3rd, which means that in order to participate, Aretha would need to have established residency in Michigan no later than October 4th of that year. \n\nWithout additional information, we cannot determine whether or not Aretha had established residency in Michigan by October 4th, 1964. Therefore, the answer to the question could be either yes or no, depending on this missing information. However, based solely on her age, Aretha would have been old enough to vote in the 1964 presidential election."

In the United States, a person must be at least 18 years old to vote. Aretha Franklin's age is also not provided in the question, but we do know that she passed away in 2018 at the age of 76. If we assume that she reached the age of 18 before her first child was born (Franklin had four children), then we can estimate that she would have been at least 18+9 months (the length of a typical pregnancy) at the time of her second child's birth.\n\nFinally, we need to consider the timeline of U.S. presidential elections. Elections are held every four years, on the first Tuesday in November. If Aretha Franklin's second child was born outside of a presidential election year or before the election itself, then she would not have been able to vote for a president at that time.\n\nCombining all these factors, we can determine that there is insufficient information provided to answer the question definitively.
