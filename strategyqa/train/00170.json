We know that the employer is the person who hired the creator of Goofy, so the brother must be someone related to the employer. \n\nNext, we need to understand what an excommunicable offense is. In general, excommunication is a penalty handed down by the Catholic Church for serious sins. It means that the person who committed the offense is cut off from the Church and its sacraments. So, an excommunicable offense is a sin that is severe enough to warrant excommunication.\n\nWith these definitions in mind, we can assume that the question is asking whether or not the brother of the Goofy creator's employer committed a sin that would result in excommunication. We don't have any specific information about what the brother did, so we cannot make a judgment based on the details of the situation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes, because it is possible that the brother did commit an excommunicable offense. However, we cannot confirm this without further information."

Next, we need to determine who the brother of the employer is. Again, we can assume we do not need to know the identity of the employer. Moving on to the term \"excommunicable offense,\" this implies the question is related to religion. Excommunication is a religious punishment where someone is banned from the church and its sacraments. Therefore, we can conclude that the question is asking if the brother of the employer has committed an offense that would warrant excommunication from the church. Given that the answer is (A) yes, we can assume that the offense in question has been committed. However, the question does not provide any details on what this offense is, so we cannot provide further explanation on that matter."

Some examples of excommunicable offenses include apostasy (abandoning one's religious beliefs), heresy (refusing to accept church doctrines), and schism (creating a rift in the church).\nStep 5: We don't know what the offense was, so we have to assume that it was one of the excommunicable offenses.

Excommunication is a religious penalty enforced by a church or religious authority where a person is excluded from the communion or fellowship of the church due to committing a serious sin or offense.\n\nWithout any additional information or context, it is impossible to determine what the offense committed by the brother of the Goofy creator's employer was.

Excommunication is a religious penalty imposed by the Catholic Church, which means that a person is no longer allowed to receive the sacraments of the church. Excommunication can be imposed on someone who commits a serious offense, like murder or heresy.\n\nSo, putting these two things together, we can assume that the brother of the Goofy creator's employer committed some kind of serious offense that would make him subject to the penalty of excommunication by the Catholic Church.\n\nBased on this assumption, the answer to the question is (A) yes, the brother of the Goofy creator's employer did commit an excommunicable offense.
