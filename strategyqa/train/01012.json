Lactose is a sugar found in dairy products, and lactose intolerance is a condition where a person's body cannot digest lactose properly. This can cause symptoms such as bloating, gas, and stomach pain. \n\nCream is a dairy product that contains lactose. Therefore, if someone is lactose intolerant, they will have difficulty digesting cream, just like they would with other dairy products. This means that they should avoid consuming cream, as it can cause uncomfortable symptoms. \n\nSo the answer to the question is (A) yes, someone who is lactose intolerant should avoid cream."

Lactose intolerant means that the body cannot digest lactose properly because it lacks an enzyme called lactase.\n- What happens when someone with lactose intolerance consumes lactose? They can experience symptoms like bloating, gas, stomach pain, and diarrhea.\n- Can cream contain lactose? Yes, cream is made from milk, so it can contain lactose.\n- Therefore, if someone is lactose intolerant, they would have to avoid cream to prevent experiencing symptoms associated with lactose intolerance. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

Lactose is a sugar found in milk and dairy products, and lactose intolerant individuals have a deficiency of the enzyme lactase, which is needed to break down lactose. When lactose is not properly digested, it can cause digestive symptoms such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea.\n\nCream is a dairy product that contains lactose, so if someone is lactose intolerant, they may experience symptoms if they consume cream. Even though cream is not as high in lactose as milk, it still contains enough lactose to cause issues for lactose intolerant individuals.
