While Golden eagles are known to consume carrion, they primarily hunt live prey such as rabbits, hares, and other small mammals. Therefore, Golden eagles are not considered scavenger birds.

Golden eagles are known for their hunting skills and primarily feed on live animals such as rabbits, hares, rodents, and occasionally larger animals like deer. While they may scavenge on occasion, it is not a common behavior for them. Therefore, the correct answer is no, the Golden eagle is not considered a scavenger bird."
