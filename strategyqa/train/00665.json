He has not been known to have any experience or training in NASCAR racing. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that he could win a NASCAR Cup Series race in 2020 or any other year. \n\nMoreover, NASCAR Cup Series race is one of the most competitive and challenging races in the world, where only the best of the best drivers compete. To participate in this race, one must be a certified and experienced driver with excellent skills and abilities, and they must also go through trials and training to qualify. \n\nAdditionally, if a driver has to win the NASCAR Cup Series race, they must have the right car, proper support team, resources, and expertise to compete with others. Even experienced drivers with years of experience in NASCAR racing can struggle to win a NASCAR Cup Series race. \n\nHence, considering that William Franklyn-Miller is not a professional and experienced driver, and lacks the necessary skills, experience, support, and resources, it is highly impossible for him to win a NASCAR Cup Series race in 2020, or in the future. Thus, option (B), \"no\" is the correct answer."
