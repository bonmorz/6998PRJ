The first game in the series was released in 1986, and since then, several sequels have been developed and released. So, the question here is whether or not Electronic Arts profited from any of the Metroid game sales.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to know if Electronic Arts was involved in the development or distribution of any Metroid games. However, as per the records, Nintendo has always been the sole developer and publisher of the Metroid series, and Electronic Arts has never been involved in any of its releases. Hence, it is safe to say that Electronic Arts did not profit from any of the Metroid game sales, and the correct answer is B - No."
