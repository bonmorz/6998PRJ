So in this case, the question is asking if the number of Jackson 5 members is greater than the number of The Osmonds members.\n\nNext, we need to know the number of members in each group. The Jackson 5 consisted of five members: Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Michael Jackson. The Osmonds, on the other hand, consisted of five brothers: Alan, Wayne, Merrill, Jay, and Donny.\n\nSince both groups have the same number of members, the answer to the question is \"no\", they did not exceed the number of members in The Osmonds."

Both these groups were popular in the 1970s and were part of the Motown and pop music scenes. \n\nNext, we need to determine what the question is asking. It is asking if the number of members in Jackson 5 exceeded that of The Osmonds. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to research the number of members in both groups. The Jackson 5 consisted of five brothers: Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Michael. On the other hand, The Osmonds consisted of nine siblings: Alan, Wayne, Merrill, Jay, Donny, Marie, Tom, Virl, and Jimmy. \n\nFrom this information, we can conclude that The Osmonds had more members than the Jackson 5. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."
