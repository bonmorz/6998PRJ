Symphony of the Seas is the largest cruise ship in the world, with a capacity of 6,680 passengers and 2,200 crew members. \n\nNext, we need to know the size of the People's Volunteer Army. As of 2021, the size of the People's Volunteer Army is estimated to be around 2 million active personnel. \n\nGiven these numbers, it is not possible for all of the People's Volunteer Army to be transported on Symphony of the Seas. Even if we assume that all crew members are removed and only passengers are accommodated, the total capacity of Symphony of the Seas is less than 0.5% of the size of the People's Volunteer Army. This means that it would take more than 400 trips of Symphony of the Seas to transport all of the People's Volunteer Army, which is not practical or feasible.

The Symphony of the Seas is the largest cruise ship in the world with a maximum capacity of 6,680 passengers and 2,200 crew members. \n\nTo figure out if all People's Volunteer Army personnel could hypothetically be transported on the Symphony of the Seas, we need to consider several factors. Firstly, the ship's capacity is limited to just under 10,000 people, which is much lower than the number of personnel in the army.\n\nSecondly, we need to think about the practicalities of transporting such a large number of people. The army would require extensive accommodations, food and water provisions, training areas, and other resources that a cruise ship is not equipped to provide.\n\nAdditionally, it would pose significant security risks and logistical challenges to have such a large number of military personnel on a commercial cruise ship. The ship's crew and other passengers may not feel comfortable with having armed forces onboard, and it could also be a target for potential security threats.\n\nTherefore, based on these factors, we can confidently say that the answer to the question is (B) no, it is not feasible or practical for all People's Volunteer Army personnel to be transported on the Symphony of the Seas."
