Now, can we measure the size of a Caracal, which is a type of wild cat, with an angle? No, we cannot. A Caracal's size is typically measured in length (from nose to tail), height (from ground to shoulder), and weight - all of which require different tools, such as a tape measure and a scale. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, we cannot measure a Caracal with a protractor."

Secondly, Caracals are animals, and as such, they have a three-dimensional shape.
