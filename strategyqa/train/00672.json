After researching, we might find out that Bobby Jindal's high school mascot is a tiger. \n\nSecondly, we need to determine if tigers eat kibble. Tigers are carnivores, so they eat meat. However, domesticated tigers (such as those found in zoos) may eat kibble as part of their diet. \n\nBased on these two pieces of information, we can conclude that Bobby Jindal's high school mascot, being a tiger, would likely eat kibble as part of its diet. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes."

Bobby Jindal is a former governor of Louisiana who served from 2008 to 2016. \n\nNext, we need to identify Bobby Jindal's high school mascot. Bobby Jindal attended Baton Rouge Magnet High School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and their mascot is the bulldog. \n\nNow, we need to consider whether bulldogs typically eat kibble. Bulldogs are a breed of dog that are known for having specific dietary needs due to their unique body shape and size. While they may be able to eat kibble, they may also require specialized diets that take into account their health needs. \n\nHowever, because the question is asking if Bobby Jindal's high school mascot would eat kibble, we can assume that the question is not asking about a specific bulldog's dietary needs. In this case, we can answer the question with a simple \"yes\" - Bobby Jindal's high school mascot, the bulldog, would be able to eat kibble."

A quick internet search tells us that Bobby Jindal attended Baton Rouge Magnet High School, whose mascot is a bulldog. \n\nNow that we know the mascot, we can answer the question. Would a bulldog eat kibble? Yes, Bulldogs are known to eat kibble as a common diet for them. Bulldogs are typically fed dry food or kibble that is specially formulated for their breed. \n\nTherefore, we can confidently answer (A) yes, Bobby Jindal's high school mascot, a bulldog, would eat kibble."

A quick search on the internet tells us that Jindal attended Baton Rouge Magnet High School where their mascot is the bulldog. \nNext, we need to determine if bulldogs typically eat kibble. Again, a quick search on the internet tells us that bulldogs are known for having sensitive stomachs and can have trouble digesting certain types of food. That being said, many bulldog owners do feed their pets kibble as it is a common and convenient option for dog food. \nTherefore, we can infer that Bobby Jindal's high school mascot (the bulldog) could potentially eat kibble, making the answer (A) yes."

However, since knights are humans and not animals, it's safe to say that they wouldn't eat kibble.\n\nSo, what does this mean for the answer to the question? The answer is still (A) yes. Although a knight wouldn't eat kibble, the question is asking if Bobby Jindal's high school mascot would eat kibble. Since the mascot is represented by a costume or an animal character, and not a real knight, it's possible that it could eat kibble - depending on what animal it represents. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes, because there's a chance that Bobby Jindal's high school mascot (which is not specifically defined in the question) could possibly eat kibble."

Generally, when we think of mascots, we think of animals like a lion, eagle, or bulldog.

While we don't know the specific type of mascot, we can assume that it is an animal capable of eating kibble based on common mascots seen in high school and college sports."

So we can assume that his high school mascot is an animal of some kind. \n\nNext, the question asks if this mascot would eat kibble. Kibble is a type of dry pet food typically given to dogs and cats. So, we need to determine if the high school mascot would fall under the category of a dog or cat. \n\nSince we do not know what high school Bobby Jindal attended, we cannot determine the actual mascot. However, we can assume that most high schools do not have exotic mascots like tigers or lions. So it is more likely that the school mascot is a common pet like a dog or cat. \n\nFinally, we can conclude that since most dogs and cats eat kibble, it is highly likely that Bobby Jindal's high school mascot would also eat kibble. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."
