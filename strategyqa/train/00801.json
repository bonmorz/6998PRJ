                "content": "First, we need to understand what a tailor does. A tailor is a professional who alters and creates clothing to fit their clients' specific needs. Typically, a tailor will use various sewing techniques and tools, such as a sewing needle and thread or a sewing machine, to create an accurate and well-fitted garment.\n\nNow, onto the question - would an expensive tailor use adhesive to create a shorter hem on slacks? The answer is no. A tailor who takes pride in their work and reputation is unlikely to compromise the quality of their work by using a quick-fix adhesive to create a shorter hem on slacks. Glue or adhesive may work for a temporary fix, but it is not a lasting solution and may damage the garment in the long run.\n\nInstead, a skilled tailor would measure and mark the desired length of the hem before trimming it to size. They would then use their sewing expertise to carefully and accurately sew the new hem in place, taking care to ensure that it is even and properly aligned with the rest of the garment.\n\nIn summary, an expensive tailor is likely to use their expertise and sewing techniques to create a well-crafted product rather than resorting to adhesive to create a shorter hem on slacks."

Adhesive may provide a quick fix, but it is not a durable solution. If a tailor is charging a high price for their services, they are likely using professional techniques and materials to ensure the longevity of the garment.\n\nSecondly, a shorter hem on slacks can be accomplished using traditional tailoring methods such as measuring and cutting, followed by sewing a new hem. This precise technique allows for a clean finish that won't unravel, and it can be easily adjusted if necessary.\n\nFinally, adhesive may also damage the fabric or leave unsightly residue. A good tailor would never risk compromising the quality of the garment or the overall appearance.\n\nIn conclusion, an expensive tailor is unlikely to use adhesive to create a shorter hem on slacks, as it goes against the principles of quality tailoring. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

                "content": "First, we need to understand what a tailor does. A tailor is a professional who specializes in making and altering clothing, such as suits, shirts, and pants. One of the main tasks of a tailor is to adjust the fit and length of garments to ensure they look and feel comfortable on the wearer.\n\nNow, let's consider the question. Would an expensive tailor use adhesive to create a shorter hem on slacks? The answer is no. Here's why:\n\n1. Adhesive is not a permanent solution: A tailor who takes pride in their work would not use a temporary fix, such as adhesive, to create a shorter hem on slacks. Adhesive can easily wear off or peel away, which could result in the pants looking untidy or even falling apart.\n\n2. Adhesive can damage fabric: Another reason why an expensive tailor would not use adhesive to shorten pants is that it can damage the fabric. Adhesive can leave behind residue that is difficult to remove, and it can weaken the fibers of the fabric, which can lead to tears or holes over time.\n\n3. Professional tailors use traditional sewing techniques: A reputable tailor would use traditional sewing techniques to create a shorter hem on slacks. This involves measuring the length needed, cutting the fabric appropriately, and sewing it securely in place. A skilled tailor takes pride in their work and ensures that the garment looks and feels flawless when it is returned to the client.\n\nIn summary, an expensive tailor would not use adhesive to create a shorter hem on slacks because it is not a permanent solution, can damage fabric, and is not a professional approach. Instead, a skilled tailor would use traditional sewing techniques to achieve a well-tailored garment."

They are likely to use high-quality materials and techniques to make clothing that lasts. Hemming pants with an adhesive is not a proper tailoring technique and can lead to a shorter lifespan for the garment. Furthermore, adhesives can damage the fabric and leave residue, compromising the appearance of the pants.

Tailors are known for their careful work and attention to detail, often using very precise techniques to create high-quality garments. \n\nNow let's focus on the question itself. The question asks whether an expensive tailor would use adhesive to create a shorter hem on slacks. Adhesive, such as glue or tape, is not a professional technique that a skilled tailor would typically use for alterations. \n\nInstead, a tailor would most likely use a combination of cutting the fabric and sewing it to achieve the desired length. They may also use other tools such as an iron, hemming tape, and even a hemming stitch. Using adhesive leaves the hem susceptible to degradation over time and is not a reliable or professional technique for tailoring. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, an expensive tailor would not use adhesive to create a shorter hem on slacks."
