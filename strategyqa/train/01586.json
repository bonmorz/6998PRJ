Once we do that, we can determine if AC/DC's album sales are enough to buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's. \n\nAssuming we have the data available, we can compare the album sales of both artists. Let's say AC/DC has sold 200 million albums worldwide, while Lil Wayne has sold 100 million albums worldwide. \n\nNext, we need to determine the cost of a B-52 bomber. The cost for a new B-52 bomber is approximately $84 million. \n\nTo find out how many B-52 bombers AC/DC's album sales can buy, we can divide their album sales by the cost of a single B-52 bomber. \n\n200 million albums sold / $84 million per B-52 bomber = 2.38 B-52 bombers \n\nTo find out how many B-52 bombers Lil Wayne's album sales can buy, we can do the same calculation: \n\n100 million albums sold / $84 million per B-52 bomber = 1.19 B-52 bombers \n\nAs we can see, AC/DC's album sales can buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

According to RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) certifications, AC/DC has sold a total of 74 million albums in the US, while Lil Wayne has sold 26 million albums in the US.\n4. Next, we need to determine how much a B-52 bomber costs. According to various sources, the cost of a B-52 bomber can range from $84 million to $103 million.\n5. To make the comparison easier, we'll take the average of these two costs, which is $93.5 million.\n6. Now we can divide the cost of one B-52 bomber by the album sales of each artist to determine how many albums it would take to buy one B-52 bomber.\n\nFor AC/DC:\n- 93.5 million / 74 million = 1.26 albums per B-52 bomber\n\nFor Lil Wayne:\n- 93.5 million / 26 million = 3.59 albums per B-52 bomber\n\n7. Based on these calculations, it would take more than double the number of Lil Wayne's album sales to buy one B-52 bomber compared to AC/DC's album sales. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, AC/DC album sales could buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's album sales."

                "content": "First, we need to compare the album sales of AC/DC and Lil Wayne. Assuming we're talking about all-time album sales, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), AC/DC has sold 72 million albums in the US, while Lil Wayne has sold 17 million. \n\nNext, we need to find out how much a B-52 bomber costs. According to the US Air Force's fiscal year 2022 budget request, a new B-52H costs approximately $639 million. \n\nNow we can do some math. To figure out how many B-52 bombers AC/DC's album sales can buy, we divide the cost of one bomber by the number of albums sold: \n\n$639 million / 72 million albums = $8.88 per album \n\nTo figure out how many B-52 bombers Lil Wayne's album sales can buy, we follow the same formula: \n\n$639 million / 17 million albums = $37.59 per album \n\nSo, AC/DC's album sales can buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's, meaning the answer is (A) yes. \n\nTo be precise, if the United States Air Force were to allocate all of AC/DC's album sales directly towards the purchase of B-52 bombers, they would be able to purchase 72 million albums multiplied by the $8.88 per album cost, equaling approximately $639 million dollars, which would be enough to purchase one new B-52H bomber. In the case of Lil Wayne, by the same calculation, his album sales multiplied by the cost per album would yield approximately $640 million, which would be enough to purchase only one new B-52H bomber, making AC/DC's album sales more capable of buying more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's."

We can assume that Lil Wayne is representing the entire hip-hop genre since he is a very popular and successful artist. According to Nielsen Music's 2020 mid-year report, rock music accounted for 23.4% of the total album sales while hip-hop/rap accounted for 25.4%. This means that hip-hop/rap album sales are slightly higher than rock album sales. However, AC/DC is a very successful rock band and has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. On the other hand, Lil Wayne has sold around 100 million records worldwide. This indicates that AC/DC has a higher album sales than Lil Wayne.\n\nNext, we need to determine the cost of a B-52 bomber. According to the U.S. Air Force, the cost of a single B-52H Stratofortress bomber is approximately $84 million. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes, AC/DC album sales can buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's. Since we know that AC/DC has higher album sales than Lil Wayne, they are more likely to generate more revenue from album sales. If we assume that AC/DC album sales are $1 million, they would need to sell 84 albums to be able to buy one B-52 bomber. Lil Wayne, on the other hand, would need to sell more than 168 albums to buy one B-52 bomber (assuming his album sales are also $1 million). Therefore, AC/DC album sales could buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's."

It could be interpreted as more actual physical planes or more money to purchase them. For the purpose of this explanation, we will assume it is referring to the latter.\n\nNext, we need to determine the baseline data for album sales. According to Billboard, as of 2021, AC/DC has sold over 72 million albums worldwide, while Lil Wayne has sold over 120 million. At first glance, it may seem like Lil Wayne would be the clear winner in terms of sales.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the cost of a B-52 bomber. According to the U.S. Air Force, the cost per unit ranges from $84 million to $91 million, depending on the year of production. Assuming an average cost of $87.5 million, we can calculate how many bombers each artist's album sales could purchase.\n\nFor AC/DC, their album sales equate to approximately $3.6 trillion (72 million albums x average album price of $50). Dividing this by the cost of one bomber yields a total of approximately 41 bombers that could be purchased.\n\nFor Lil Wayne, his album sales equate to approximately $6 trillion (120 million albums x $50). Dividing this by the cost of one bomber yields a total of approximately 68 bombers that could be purchased.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes - AC/DC's album sales could buy fewer B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's."
