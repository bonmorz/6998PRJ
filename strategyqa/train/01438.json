The show follows the story of Patrick Jane, a former fake psychic, who uses his skills of observation to solve crimes as a consultant for the California Bureau of Investigation.\n\nThe first thing we have to consider is the fact that The Mentalist aired in the late 2000s and early 2010s. During this time, black and white cinematography was not commonly used in mainstream television shows. Instead, color television shows were the norm, and it was uncommon for a show to use black and white cinematography.\n\nMoreover, The Mentalist had a modern, sleek, and colorful cinematography, which reflected the show's contemporary urban setting and style. Additionally, the show often used close-ups of objects and people's faces, which would not work as well in black and white as the details and nuances of colors would be lost.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. The Mentalist was not filmed in black and white, and it had a modern, colorful cinematography."
