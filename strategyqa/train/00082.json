The Daily Mirror, however, was first published in 1903, which is approximately 300 years after Shakespeare's death. Therefore, there is no way that Shakespeare could have read the Daily Mirror. This makes option (B) the correct answer."

The Daily Mirror, on the other hand, is a British tabloid newspaper that was first published in the 20th century. This immediately tells us that it's unlikely that Shakespeare could have read the Daily Mirror since it didn't exist during his time.\n\nSecondly, we can look at the timeline of Shakespeare's life. He was born in 1564 and died in 1616. The Daily Mirror was first published in 1903. This means that Shakespeare could not have read the Daily Mirror since he lived over three centuries before its publication.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Shakespeare did not read the Daily Mirror. It's impossible for him to have done so given the timeline of his life and the publication date of the newspaper."
