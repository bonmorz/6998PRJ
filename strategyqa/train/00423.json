Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a hormone that is released by the adrenal glands in response to stress or excitement. It increases heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate, among other physiological effects. \n\nNow, let's focus on the movie \"Scary Movie.\" This is a horror-comedy film that parodies a number of popular horror movies. Although it is intended to be scary, it is also meant to be funny. \n\nBased on these two pieces of information, we can conclude that the viewer is unlikely to experience a significant increase in adrenaline while watching \"Scary Movie.\" While the film may be suspenseful or scary at times, the comedic elements help to alleviate some of that tension. Additionally, since the viewer knows that the film is a parody and not a true horror movie, they are less likely to feel genuinely scared or threatened. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, the viewer is not likely to experience an increase in adrenaline while viewing \"Scary Movie.\""

Therefore, it is unlikely that watching \"Scary Movie\" will cause the viewer to feel genuine fear or stress, which are the primary triggers for adrenaline release.\n\nAdditionally, some individuals may have a different physiological response to fear stimuli, so it is possible that certain viewers may experience an increase in adrenaline while watching \"Scary Movie.\" However, for the majority of people, the answer to this question is (B) no, as they are unlikely to experience a significant increase in adrenaline while watching this particular film."

Some people may experience an increase in adrenaline while watching \"Scary Movie,\" while others may not. Additionally, the level of fear or suspense created by the movie may also play a role in whether or not adrenaline is released. \n\nWith that being said, the answer to the question is (B) no, because the statement says \"is the viewer likely to experience an increase in adrenaline?\" and does not account for varying individual responses or levels of fear/suspense created by the movie. It is possible that some viewers may experience an increase in adrenaline while watching \"Scary Movie,\" but it cannot be assumed that all viewers will."
