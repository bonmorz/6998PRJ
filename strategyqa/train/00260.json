As of 2021, the president of Ohio University is Dr. Hugh Sherman. \nNext, we need to consider whether wearing a jockstrap is a common practice for male individuals. The purpose of a jockstrap is to provide support and protection for the male genitalia during physical activity. It would not be uncommon for someone who is physically active or participates in sports to wear a jockstrap. \nHowever, we cannot assume based on profession or gender alone whether someone would wear a jockstrap. \nTherefore, we cannot definitively determine whether Dr. Hugh Sherman, as the current president of Ohio University, would hypothetically wear a jockstrap. However, \"yes\" is the correct answer as it is a possibility based on his physical activity habits."

Once we have the name of the current president, we must consider whether wearing a jockstrap is a common practice among men. Jockstraps are commonly worn by men during physical activity or sports to provide support and protection for the genital area. It is reasonable to assume that the president of a university engages in physical activity or sports at some point, so it is possible that they would wear a jockstrap. However, without any further information about the president's personal habits or preferences, it is impossible to say for sure whether they would wear a jockstrap or not. Therefore, the answer must be hypothetical and can only be determined through speculation. Based on the reasonable assumption that the president may engage in physical activity or sports, it is safe to say that the answer is (A) yes, the current president of Ohio University hypothetically could wear a jockstrap."

As an AI language model, I am not able to determine the current president of Ohio University as my training data only goes up to May 2021.

It provides support and protection to the genitals during physical activities. While it is not a requirement for men to wear jockstraps, they might choose to wear them for comfort and functionality.\n\nGiven that the Ohio University president is a male and that he may engage in physical activities, it is possible that he wears a jockstrap. Of course, we cannot know for sure unless we ask him directly or observe him in his personal life. However, based on the probability that he engages in activities that may require jockstrap usage, we can assume that the answer is \"yes\" - he would hypothetically wear a jockstrap."
