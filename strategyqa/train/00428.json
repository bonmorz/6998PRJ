That's because the Eiffel Tower's height is measured from sea level, which means it is already above water. So when we subtract the depth of the Litke Deep, we get a negative number, which indicates that the Eiffel Tower is still above water even if it was placed at the Arctic Ocean's deepest point. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is actually (A) yes - but with the caveat that the Eiffel Tower can't be fully submerged because it's too tall."
