According to Google Maps, the total length of the Brooklyn Bridge is approximately 5,989 feet. \n\nNext, we need to know the maximum speed of DRL Racer X drone. According to Drone Racing League (DRL) official website, the maximum speed of DRL Racer X drone is 162.2 miles per hour.

Next, we need to evaluate the speed of DRL Racer X drone. Unfortunately, the speed of DRL Racer X drone is not given in the question. Even if the speed of the drone was provided, it would not be possible for the drone to cover such a long distance in just 18 seconds. To calculate the time required to cover the distance of the bridge, we can use the formula:\n\ntime = distance / speed\n\nLet's assume the drone's speed is 100 mph (which is very fast even for a racing drone). Using the above formula, we get:\n\ntime = 1.8 km / (100 mph * 1.60934) = 0.011 hours or 39.6 seconds\n\nAs we can see, even at a speed of 100 mph, it would take around 40 seconds for the drone to cross the Brooklyn Bridge. Thus, we can safely answer that DRL Racer X drone cannot get across Brooklyn Bridge in 18 seconds; the correct answer is (B) no."
