Thus, chronologically speaking, it is impossible for Amazon to be involved in the lunar landing.

Next, we need to identify the companies and organizations that were involved in the lunar landing. NASA was the primary organization leading the effort, but there were several companies that provided equipment and materials for the mission, such as Boeing, IBM, and Honeywell. However, Amazon was not founded until 1994, more than 25 years after the lunar landing, which means it could not have been involved in the mission. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, Amazon was not involved in the lunar landing."
