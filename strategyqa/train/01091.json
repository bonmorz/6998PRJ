The 23rd amendment was added to the US Constitution in 1961, granting residents of Washington D.C. the right to vote for president and vice president. This amendment did not mention Puerto Rico or any other US territories.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is no, the 23rd amendment did not give Puerto Ricans the right to vote for president. Puerto Rico is a US territory, and residents of US territories do not have the same right to vote for president as residents of the 50 states and D.C. do.\n\nPuerto Ricans can vote in Presidential primaries, but they are not allowed to vote for president in the general election. Only US citizens who reside in the 50 states or D.C. are allowed to vote in the general election for president."

Therefore, even though the 23rd amendment gave the residents of Washington D.C. the right to vote for president, it did not extend to Puerto Rico. \n\nIn fact, Puerto Rico is still considered a territory and its residents do not have the right to vote for president in the general election. However, Puerto Ricans can vote in presidential primaries and can also vote for delegates who attend parties\u2019 national conventions and help select their presidential nominees.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, the 23rd amendment did not give Puerto Ricans the right to vote for president."

The 23rd amendment was ratified in 1961 and it granted the residents of Washington D.C. the right to vote for president and vice president. Prior to this amendment, residents of the district were not allowed to vote in presidential elections.\n\nNext, we need to understand the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States. Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States, meaning it is controlled by the U.S. federal government but is not a part of the United States itself. This relationship is defined by the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950.\n\nGiven these facts, we can conclude that the 23rd amendment did not give Puerto Ricans the right to vote for president. This is because Puerto Rico, as an unincorporated territory, is not considered a state and therefore does not have voting rights in presidential elections. Only residents of the 50 states and Washington D.C. are granted this right under the 23rd amendment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no."

Puerto Rico is not a state, but a U.S. territory. This means that while Puerto Ricans are citizens of the United States, they don't have the same rights as citizens living in states. For example, they can't vote for president or have voting representation in Congress. \n\nTherefore, even though the 23rd amendment extended voting rights to residents of Washington, D.C., it did not grant those same rights to Puerto Ricans. The answer to the question is (B) no, the 23rd amendment did not give Puerto Ricans the right to vote for president."

(District of Columbia) the right to vote in presidential elections. It gave D.C. three electoral votes, which means that D.C. residents can now participate in the presidential election process.\n\nNow, let's come to the question. The question is asking whether the 23rd amendment gave Puerto Ricans the right to vote for the president. Puerto Rico is a US territory and not a state. Therefore, Puerto Ricans do not have the right to vote in presidential elections or in congressional elections. They also do not have voting representation in Congress. Even though Puerto Ricans are US citizens, they cannot vote for the president unless they move to the mainland United States.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, the 23rd amendment did not give Puerto Ricans the right to vote for the president. The purpose of the 23rd amendment was to give the residents of D.C. the right to vote in presidential elections."
