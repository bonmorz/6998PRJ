This means that in order for the answer to be \"yes\", it must be true that hippopotamus are exclusive to Africa. However, this is not the case. \n\nAlthough Africa is home to the majority of the world's hippopotamus population, you can actually find them in a few other places as well. For example, small populations exist in Colombia, Venezuela, and Guyana in South America. Additionally, hippos have been introduced to some other countries for conservation or tourism purposes, such as Israel's Hula Valley, where they were reintroduced after going extinct in the area. \n\nThus, the correct answer is (B) no - you can see hippopotamus in places other than Africa."

Next, we need to consider where hippopotamuses are found. While hippopotamuses are most commonly associated with Africa, they are not only found there. In fact, they can also be found in parts of Asia, specifically India and Thailand. Therefore, the correct answer is (B), no, you can also see hippopotamuses in Asia."

Additionally, there have been stories of hippopotamuses introduced to Colombia by drug lord Pablo Escobar, who imported several of them to his private zoo in the 1980s. After his death, the hippos were released into the wild and have since thrived in the area.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, hippopotamus can be found in places other than Africa."
