A Broadway character is a character from a musical that has been performed on Broadway, which is a famous street in New York City that is known for its theaters. \n\nNext, we need to identify what a missionary is. A missionary is someone who travels to a foreign country to spread their religious beliefs or help others.\n\nNow, we know what Broadway characters and missionaries are. We need to determine if there is a popular Broadway character who is also a missionary. \n\nThere are many musicals that take place in foreign countries, such as The King and I, Miss Saigon, and Aladdin. However, not all of these musicals have characters who are specifically described as missionaries.\n\nBut, there is one popular Broadway character who is a missionary - Elder Price from the musical The Book of Mormon. The show follows two young Mormon missionaries, Elder Price and Elder Cunningham, as they travel to Uganda to spread the word of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Elder Price in particular is a determined and enthusiastic missionary who struggles to adapt to the realities of life in Uganda.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, there is a popular Broadway character who is a missionary - Elder Price from The Book of Mormon."

There have been many popular Broadway shows over the years, and it's possible that a character who fits the description of a missionary has appeared in one of them. After doing some research or consulting with someone who is knowledgeable about Broadway productions, we can determine that the answer is yes - there is indeed a popular Broadway character who is a missionary. For example, Elder Price from the musical \"The Book of Mormon\" is a Mormon missionary who is sent to Uganda to convert the locals."
