Mozart died in 1791, while Wagner was not born until 1813.

However, there is no record of such an accusation ever being made, and it is unlikely that it could have happened given the timeline of their lives.\n\nBased on these facts, we can confidently answer the question as (B) no, Mozart was not accused of stealing from Richard Wagner."
