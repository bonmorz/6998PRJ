Edward II was not king at that time; he only ascended to the throne in 1307 after his father's death. \n\nSo, based on historical facts, Edward II could not have been crucial to England's victory at the Battle of Falkirk because he was not involved in the battle.

The battle resulted in a significant victory for the English army.\n\nNow, let's analyze Edward II's role in this battle. Edward II was not present at the Battle of Falkirk as he was only six years old at the time. He became King of England in 1307, which was nearly a decade after the Battle of Falkirk.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Edward II was not crucial to England's victory at the Battle of Falkirk. In fact, he had no role to play in the battle as he was not a part of the army or the ruling monarch at that time. The answer is (B) no."

Edward II, who would later become King of England, was only around 14 years old at the time and did not play a significant role in the battle. The primary leader of the English forces was Edward I, also known as Edward Longshanks.

The Battle of Falkirk was fought between the English army led by King Edward I and the Scottish army led by William Wallace in 1298.

The Battle of Falkirk was a military conflict that took place on July 22, 1298, in Scotland, during the First War of Scottish Independence.\n\nNext, we need to understand who Edward II was and his role in the Battle of Falkirk. Edward II was not the king of England at the time of the Battle of Falkirk. He was born in 1284, and he was only 14 years old when the Battle of Falkirk took place. Therefore, he couldn't have had any role in the battle.\n\nMoreover, the Battle of Falkirk was fought between the Scottish army, led by William Wallace, and the English army, led by King Edward I (Edward II's father), who was heavily involved in the war effort against the Scots. Therefore, even if Edward II had been older at the time of the battle, he wouldn't have been crucial to England's victory because he wasn't the commander of the English army or a significant figure in the war at that point in time.\n\nBased on these facts, we can confidently conclude that the answer to the question \"Was Edward II crucial to England's victory at Battle of Falkirk?\" is (B) no."
