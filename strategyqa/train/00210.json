It is a national holiday that celebrates the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, marking the birth of the United States of America. \n\nNext, let's think about the season of autumn. Autumn officially begins on the equinox, which falls on September 22 or 23 in the Northern Hemisphere. \n\nSince Independence Day is celebrated on July 4th, which is in the summer season, we can confidently answer that the correct answer is (B) no, American Independence Day does not occur during autumn."
