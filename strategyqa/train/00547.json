                "content": "In general, a person's age is determined by subtracting their birth year from the current year. However, in the case of a leap year baby, we need to consider a couple of additional factors.\n\nFirstly, leap year babies are born on February 29th, which only occurs once every 4 years (in a leap year). This means that in regular (non-leap) years, they celebrate their birthday on either February 28th or March 1st.\n\nSecondly, the question specifically asks about a baby born in 1996, which was indeed a leap year.\n\nSo, let's apply this information to determine the baby's age in 2000. In 1997, they would have been 1 year old (since they were born in a leap year, they would have had their first birthday celebration on February 28th/March 1st of that year). The same would be true for 1998 and 1999, so by the time 2000 rolls around, the baby would be \"technically\" 4 years old, even though they only had 3 birthday celebrations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes, the 1996 leap year baby would technically be 1 year old in 2000."

As a leap year baby, the person would have been born on February 29, 1996. \n\nIf we calculate the person's age in 1997, we would say that they are 1 year old, even though they were only born in February of the previous year. Similarly, in 1998, we would say that they are 2 years old, and so on. \n\nTherefore, by the year 2000, the leap year baby would have celebrated 4 birthdays, even though they were only born in 1996. Thus, it is technically correct to say that the 1996 leap year baby would be 1 year old in 2000. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

                "content": "First, we need to understand what a leap year is. A leap year is a year that has 366 days instead of 365, and it occurs every four years. This is because a year is actually 365.25 days long, and we add an extra day to the calendar every four years to account for this.\n\nNow, let's apply this knowledge to the question. If someone was born in a leap year, their age would be calculated as usual for the first few years of their life. They would turn one year old on their first birthday, which would occur one year after their birthdate. \n\nHowever, when it comes to leap years, things get a little more complicated. If someone was born on February 29th (the leap day), their birthday only occurs once every four years. In the other years, their \"birthday\" would technically be celebrated on February 28th. \n\nSo, to answer the question - if someone was born on February 29th, 1996 (a leap year), they would turn 1 year old on February 28th, 1997. They would turn 2 years old on February 28th, 1998, and so on. So, by the time the year 2000 rolled around, this person would have technically celebrated 4 birthdays - on February 28th, 1997, 1998, 1999, and finally February 29th, 2000. Therefore, they would be considered 4 years old in 2000, even though they were only technically born in 1996. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes - the leap year baby would technically be 1 year old in 1997, but would have celebrated 4 birthdays by the time the year 2000 rolled around, making them 4 years old."

However, leap year babies (born on February 29th) present a unique case, as February 29th only occurs once every four years. Therefore, to determine their age, we need to consider the number of leap years that have occurred since their birth.\n\nIn this case, the baby was born in 1996, which was a leap year. The next leap year occurred four years later in 2000. Therefore, by the time the baby's first \"official\" birthday occurred in 2000, there had been one leap year since their birth. As a result, the baby would technically be 1 year old in 2000.\n\nTo further illustrate, suppose the baby was born on February 29th, 1996. Their first birthday (in 1997) would occur on the same day as any other non-leap year baby born on February 29th - when they turn one year old, they have only lived for 365 days. However, when their second \"birthday\" rolls around in 2000, three more years have passed (1998, 1999, and 2000), and there has been one additional leap year (2000). Therefore, the baby has actually lived for 1461 days (365 x 4). Dividing by 365, we get approximately 4 years old, which is consistent with the idea that the baby would technically be 1 year old in 2000."

If the baby was born on February 29th, then their first birthday would have occurred on February 29th, 1997. This means that by 2000, the baby would have already had three birthdays - one in 1997, one in 1998, and one in 1999. Therefore, in 2000, the baby would technically be 4 years old, even though they were born in a leap year. \n\nHowever, if the baby was born on any other day in 1996, their first birthday would have occurred on the same day in 1997, and they would turn 2 in 1998, 3 in 1999, and 4 in 2000. So, in this case, the baby would be 4 years old in 2000, just like any other baby born in a non-leap year. \n\nTherefore, based on these scenarios, we can conclude that a 1996 leap year baby would technically be 1 year old in 1997, but would be 4 years old in 2000.
