                "content": "First, we need to understand that toilet paper is made from wood pulp, which comes from trees. So, if there were no loggers, there would be no trees cut down to make wood pulp. This means that there would be a scarcity of raw materials needed to make toilet paper. As a result, it would be difficult to produce enough toilet paper to meet the demand of consumers. Even if companies were able to find alternative sources of wood pulp, it would still be challenging to produce as much toilet paper as we currently use. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, it would be hard to get toilet paper if there were no loggers."
