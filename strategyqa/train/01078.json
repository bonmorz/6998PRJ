Secondly, the question specifically asks about the 2008 Summer Olympics. \n\nNow, we must consider the timeline. Boris Yeltsin was the President of Russia from 1991 to 1999. He passed away in 2007, a year before the 2008 Summer Olympics. Therefore, it is impossible for him to have watched the 2008 Summer Olympics as he was no longer alive at the time. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, as Boris Yeltsin was not alive to watch the 2008 Summer Olympics."

However, just because he held this position does not mean he was alive in 2008 when the Summer Olympics took place. Therefore, we must do some research to determine whether or not he was still alive at the time. \n\nA quick internet search tells us that Boris Yeltsin passed away on April 23, 2007, over a year before the 2008 Summer Olympics took place. Therefore, we can confidently answer this question with \"no,\" as it was not possible for Yeltsin to have watched the 2008 Summer Olympics. \n\nIt's important to note that even if Yeltsin were alive during the time of the Summer Olympics, we still cannot definitively say whether or not he watched them without additional information."

We cannot say for certain, but we do know that Boris Yeltsin passed away on April 23rd, 2007, over a year before the 2008 Summer Olympics began. Therefore, it is safe to say that he did not watch the Olympics in 2008. \n\nThe correct answer is (B) no."
