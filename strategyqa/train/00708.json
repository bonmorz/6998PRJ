Iggy Pop is a punk rock musician known for his rebellious music, wild stage presence, and distinct voice. On the other hand, Justin Bieber is a pop singer known for his catchy tunes and slick dance moves. \n\nGiven their vastly different genres and styles of music, it seems unlikely that Iggy Pop would choose to travel with Justin Bieber. Additionally, considering that Iggy Pop is known for his unconventional image and independent spirit, it seems even less likely that he would want to be associated with Justin Bieber's image as a heavily commercialized pop star.\n\nTherefore, we can deduce that the answer to this question is (B) no."

Justin Bieber, on the other hand, is a popular pop singer who rose to fame in the early 2010s.\n\nGiven their vastly different musical styles and backgrounds, it seems unlikely that Iggy Pop would travel with Justin Bieber. Iggy Pop is known for his preference for alternative and grungy music styles, while Bieber's music is more geared towards teen pop and R&B.\n\nFurthermore, Iggy Pop is a veteran musician who has been in the industry for decades and has already achieved legendary status. He may not find it necessary or appealing to tour with a younger artist like Bieber, who is still relatively new to the music scene.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, Iggy Pop would not travel with Justin Bieber."

They come from different musical backgrounds, so it's doubtful if they would cross paths.\n\nSecond, we need to consider their lifestyles. It's unlikely that Iggy Pop, who is in his 70s, and Justin Bieber, who is in his 20s, would travel or socialize together since they belong to different generations.\n\nLastly, we need to acknowledge that the answer is subjective and based on personal opinions. However, given the above considerations, it's safe to say that the answer is (B) no, Iggy Pop and Justin Bieber would not travel together."

Justin Bieber, on the other hand, is a pop singer who rose to fame in the 2000s.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question itself. The question is asking whether Iggy Pop would travel with Justin Bieber. Based on their different musical styles and generational gaps, it is unlikely that they would travel together. \n\nFurthermore, Iggy Pop has never publicly expressed any interest in collaborating with Justin Bieber or working with him in any way. So, the answer is (B) no, Iggy Pop would not travel with Justin Bieber."
