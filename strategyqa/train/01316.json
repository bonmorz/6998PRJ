The Middle Ages are generally considered to have lasted from the 5th to the 15th century, which is a period of approximately 1000 years. \n\nNext, we need to establish how long each English monarch reigned. There were some instances where monarchs only reigned for a few months, while others reigned for several decades. \n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum number of English monarchs that could have reigned during the Middle Ages. If we assume that each English monarch reigned for an average of 20 years (which is quite generous given that there were many shorter reigns), then we can calculate that there could have been a maximum of 50 English monarchs during this period (1000 years / 20 years per monarch). \n\nHowever, this is assuming that there were no overlapping reigns. In reality, there were many instances where a monarch died before their heir was crowned, resulting in two monarchs reigning at the same time. \n\nGiven this information, we can confidently answer that there were more than fifty English kings throughout the Middle Ages, making answer (B) the correct choice."

This period is generally considered to have begun in the 5th century and ended in the 15th century. Next, we need to determine what is meant by \"English kings\" - does this include rulers of other parts of the British Isles, such as Scotland or Wales? For the purposes of this answer, let's assume it means rulers of the Kingdom of England specifically. \n\nNow, we can begin to count. The first king of England was traditionally considered to be Alfred the Great, who ruled from 871 to 899. From there, we can count each subsequent monarch up until the end of the Middle Ages. However, it's worth noting that there are some disputed or controversial reigns during this time period. For example, some historians argue that Lady Jane Grey should be counted as an English queen, even though she ruled for just nine days before being deposed. \n\nWith all that in mind, we can say definitively that there were not exactly fifty English kings throughout the Middle Ages. Depending on how we interpret and count various reigns, the total number could be slightly higher or lower than that."
