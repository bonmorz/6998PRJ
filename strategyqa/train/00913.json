Sesame Street is a popular children's television program that features a cast of characters that are mostly puppets or muppets. \n\nNext, we need to determine if Elmo was an original character on Sesame Street. To do this, we need to know when Sesame Street first aired. The show premiered on November 10, 1969. \n\nNow we need to investigate when Elmo was first introduced on the show. Elmo did not appear on Sesame Street until the mid-1970s as a minor character. He was first developed as a character called \"Baby Monster\" and evolved over time to become the lovable, furry red creature we know today. \n\nBased on these facts, we can conclude that Elmo was not an original muppet character on Sesame Street, as he was not introduced until several years after the show first premiered. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

He is a red furry monster with a high-pitched voice and a positive attitude. He is one of the most popular muppet characters on Sesame Street, and has been a beloved character for many years. \n\nSo now we can evaluate the question: was Elmo an original muppet character on Sesame Street? Since Elmo did not appear on the show until the early 1980s (approximately 11 years after the show premiered), he cannot be classified as an \"original\" character. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."
