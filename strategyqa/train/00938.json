Now, we need to consider if Disney has ever included this character in their movies. The answer is yes, Hades has appeared in the Disney movie \"Hercules\" which was released in 1997. However, the question specifically asks about a Disney Channel musical movie which is different from a full-length animated Disney movie. So, we need to verify if Hades appeared in a Disney Channel musical movie. The answer is also yes! Hades made an appearance in the Disney Channel original movie \"Descendants\" which premiered in 2015. \"Descendants\" is indeed a musical movie and features Hades as the father of one of the main characters. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (A) yes, Hades does appear in a Disney Channel musical movie."
