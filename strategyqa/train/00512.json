The Underworld, on the other hand, is regarded as a fictional location in some mythologies and beliefs, such as Greek mythology or in some religious views about the afterlife. Hence, the first thing we need to consider is whether the Underworld is a real place that can be reached through any mode of transportation. \n\nHowever, since the Underworld is considered as a fictional or imaginary location, it cannot be physically visited. It is not an actual place that can be reached by any means of transportation, including Amtrak. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. \n\nTo put it simply, the question is about traveling to a place that does not exist in reality. Therefore, the answer is negative irrespective of the mode of transportation."

The Underworld, on the other hand, is a mythical or metaphorical realm often associated with death, spirits, and the afterlife in various cultural traditions.\n\nGiven these facts, it's clear that the answer to this question is no - you cannot get a ride on Amtrak to the Underworld. Amtrak does not offer transportation to any mythical or metaphysical realms, as the company is focused on providing real-world travel options to physical destinations.\n\nAdditionally, even if we were to assume that the question is meant to be taken metaphorically or symbolically, there is still no indication that Amtrak would be an appropriate vehicle for traveling to the Underworld. Instead, mythological or spiritual traditions tend to describe different modes of transport or rituals for accessing the afterlife - such as boats across the River Styx in Greek mythology, or shamanic journeying in various indigenous cultures.\n\nIn short, while the question may be playful or whimsical, the answer is clearly no based on the practical limitations of Amtrak's services and the symbolic associations of the Underworld in various cultural contexts."
