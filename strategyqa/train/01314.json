The first Duke of Valentinois was Cesare Borgia, an Italian nobleman who lived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. \n\nNext, we need to determine the timeframe of the Hundred Years' War.

This title can refer to several individuals throughout history, but let's assume it is referring to Cesare Borgia, who was appointed as Duke of Valentinois by his father, Pope Alexander VI, in 1498. \n\nNext, we need to determine the time period of the Hundred Years' War. The Hundred Years' War took place between the years 1337 and 1453.
