The show is a dinner theater experience that features live performances of knights in combat, jousting, and other displays of medieval chivalry. \n\nBased on these definitions, we can see that the answer is (A) yes, the knights in the Medieval Times show are not authentic knights. While the performers may be skilled in fighting and riding horses, they are not members of the medieval nobility or trained in the same way that authentic knights were.

This means that we need to determine whether the knights in the show are real, authentic knights from the historical medieval period or if they are actors portraying knights in a staged production. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider a few things. First, we need to understand what the Medieval Times show is. It is a dinner theater experience that recreates the atmosphere of a medieval tournament, complete with jousting, sword fighting, and other displays of chivalry. The knights in the show wear medieval-style armor and ride horses, and they perform in front of a live audience.\n\nNext, we need to consider what an \"authentic\" knight is. In the historical medieval period, knights were a social class of mounted warriors who served their lords and king. They were skilled fighters who were expected to follow a code of chivalry, which included virtues such as courage, loyalty, and honor. They wore armor and rode horses, and they were a prominent feature of medieval warfare and society.\n\nGiven these facts, we can conclude that the knights in the Medieval Times show are not authentic knights in the historical sense. While they may wear medieval-style armor and perform feats of horsemanship and swordplay, they are not actually knights who serve a lord or king, nor are they fighting in a real medieval battle. They are actors who are paid to perform a staged production in a modern-day entertainment venue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (A) yes - the knights in the Medieval Times show are not authentic knights."
