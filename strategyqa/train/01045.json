Cosmic rays are high-energy radiation that originates from outer space and can consist of charged particles or electromagnetic radiation. \n\nNow, let's turn to H.G. Wells' \"War of the Worlds.\" This novel was published in 1898 and tells the story of an alien invasion of Earth. The narrative includes descriptions of the extraterrestrial technology and weaponry used by the invaders, as well as the aftermath of their attacks on human civilization. \n\nTo determine whether cosmic rays are included in the novel, we need to examine the text. However, a careful reading of \"War of the Worlds\" reveals that there is no mention of cosmic rays. The technology depicted in the novel is primarily based on concepts and scientific knowledge that were available at the time of its writing, such as heat rays and chemical warfare. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, H.G. Wells' \"War of the Worlds\" did not include cosmic rays. This conclusion is based on a combination of knowledge about cosmic rays themselves and a close analysis of the text of the novel."

Wells in 1898. The novel tells the story of an alien invasion of Earth, and is often considered a groundbreaking work in the science fiction genre. \n\nNow that we have that background information, we can answer the question. There is no mention of cosmic rays in \"War of the Worlds\". The novel mainly focuses on the invasion itself, the reactions of the human characters, and the aliens' advanced technology. While cosmic rays may have been a concept that was understood in Wells' time, they do not play a role in the plot or themes of the novel. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

Cosmic rays are high-energy radiation that originates from outside the solar system and can be harmful to living organisms. So, did H.G. Wells include cosmic rays in his book?\n\nThe answer is no. While \"War of the Worlds\" does describe various forms of Martian technology and weapons, including heat rays and poison gas, there is no mention of cosmic rays. In fact, cosmic rays were not discovered until 1912, well after Wells wrote his novel.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
