Therefore, they are located in different countries and are not close to each other. \n\nSecondly, Stonehenge is a set of standing stones and is relatively small in size, with the largest stones being about 30 feet tall. Even if you were close to Stonehenge, it may not be visible from a window due to its size and surrounding landscape. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, you cannot see Stonehenge from a window in Dusseldorf."

On the other hand, Dusseldorf is a city in Germany, which is quite far from the UK. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that we could see Stonehenge from a window in Dusseldorf. \n\nSecondly, we can further analyze this by looking at the coordinates of Dusseldorf and Stonehenge. Dusseldorf is located at approximately 51.2277\u00b0 N, 6.7735\u00b0 E, while Stonehenge is at approximately 51.1789\u00b0 N, 1.8262\u00b0 W. The significant difference in longitude and latitude between these two locations further confirms that it is impossible to see Stonehenge from a window in Dusseldorf. \n\nHence, based on the location of Stonehenge and Dusseldorf and their respective coordinates, the correct answer to this question is (B) no."
