While the bible does not give an exact date, it is believed that Jesus was born in the winter. The reason for this is because there were shepherds out in the fields keeping watch over their flocks, which is more likely to happen in the winter months. Finally, we need to think about when winter is. In most parts of the world, winter is between December and February. Therefore, we can conclude that Christmas is celebrated during winter. The correct answer is (A) yes."
