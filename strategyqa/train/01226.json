Skype is a communication platform that allows users to make voice and video calls, send instant messages, and share files over the internet. \n\nNext, we need to examine the question at hand - are the founders of Skype from Asia? To determine the answer, we can do some research. \n\nA quick search online reveals that the founders of Skype are actually from Europe. Specifically, Skype was founded in 2003 by Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, a Swede, and Janus Friis, a Dane. They established the company in Estonia, which is in Eastern Europe. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no - the founders of Skype are not from Asia, they are from Europe."
