The cotton ball, made out of cellulose fibers, is not a naturally occurring food source for humans and therefore cannot be broken down into usable nutrients.\n\nSecondly, the human body does not have the necessary enzymes or digestive processes to break down cellulose, the main component of cotton. Cellulose is primarily found in plants and is broken down by specialized bacteria in the digestive tracts of animals such as cows and termites.\n\nBased on these two factors, it is safe to conclude that the small intestine cannot break down a cotton ball.
