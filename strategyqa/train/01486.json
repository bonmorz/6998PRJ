No, it is not even close to the Andes region. It is located in Siberia, which is in northeastern Russia.\n5. Therefore, it is unlikely that a Coca plant farm would be found in Yakutsk.

Yakutsk is the capital city of the Sakha Republic in Russia, which is located in the northern part of Siberia. \nBased on this information, we can conclude that a Coca plant farm is unlikely to be found in Yakutsk or anywhere in the Russian tundra, as the harsh climate is not suitable for growing these types of plants. Additionally, the production and possession of cocaine are strictly prohibited by law in Russia, making it even more unlikely to find a Coca plant farm there.
