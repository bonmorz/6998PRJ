It is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second. \n\nNext, we need to determine if the UK uses the metric system, which is based on the SI units. The UK officially adopted the metric system in 1965, although it has been gradually transitioning from the imperial system since the 19th century. \n\nTherefore, since lengths are measured in metres in the metric system, and the UK has adopted the metric system, we can conclude that lengths are measured in metres in the UK. The answer is (A) yes."
