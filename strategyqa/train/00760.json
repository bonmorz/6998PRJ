Intel is a technology company that primarily focuses on computer hardware, such as processors, motherboards, and other components. On the other hand, McDonald's is a fast-food restaurant that primarily sells burgers, fries, and other food items.\n\nTherefore, it doesn't make sense for Intel products to be available at McDonald's as they are two completely unrelated businesses. Thus, the correct answer is (B) no."

Intel Corporation is a multinational technology company that designs and manufactures microprocessors and computer chips. These products are primarily used in computers, laptops, and other electronic devices. \n\nNow let's move on to McDonald's, which is a fast-food restaurant chain. McDonald's sells food items such as burgers, fries, and drinks. \n\nBased on this understanding, it is clear that McDonald's does not sell any technology products, let alone Intel products. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. \n\nIt is important to read the question carefully and think about what the question is trying to ask. In this case, the question is asking about the availability of Intel products at McDonald's, not the availability of food items at McDonald's."

McDonald's is a fast-food chain that primarily sells food and beverages.
