Thus, Poland Spring's primary product is bottled water, and they make money by selling it. \n\nNow let's consider the Sahara. The Sahara is a desert that spans across several countries in Africa, and is known for its extreme heat and aridity. It is not known for having a lot of water sources or springs. \n\nSo, can Poland Spring make money in the Sahara? The answer is yes, but with some caveats. While it may be challenging for Poland Spring to find a reliable and sustainable water source in the Sahara, they could potentially tap into underground aquifers or invest in desalination technology to extract water from the nearby Mediterranean Sea. However, they would also need to consider the logistics and cost of transporting bottled water across long distances in such extreme conditions. \n\nIn summary, while it may be difficult, Poland Spring could potentially make money in the Sahara if they are able to find or create a viable water source and effectively overcome the logistical challenges of transporting and distributing their product in a harsh environment."

This may depend on how much investment is required and if the company has the capability to set up production and distribution channels in the region. \n4. If Poland Spring can establish a successful operation in the Sahara, it is possible for the company to make money in this market. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes."

The Sahara is a desert located in Northern Africa that is known for its extreme heat and aridity. \n\nTo answer the question, we need to consider whether Poland Spring could sell its bottled water in the Sahara and make a profit. We can assume that people in the Sahara need water to survive, but there are a few factors to consider.\n\nFirstly, Poland Spring would need to transport its bottled water to the Sahara, which would likely involve significant logistical challenges and costs. They would need to ensure that the water remains safe and clean during transportation and storage.\n\nSecondly, there may be other bottled water brands available in the Sahara that are already established and trusted by consumers. Poland Spring would need to compete with these brands to gain market share and establish its own customer base.\n\nHowever, if Poland Spring is able to overcome these challenges and develop a strong distribution network in the Sahara, it could potentially make money by selling bottled water in the region. There is a demand for water in the Sahara, and if Poland Spring can offer a high-quality product at a competitive price, it could attract customers and generate revenue.\n\nOverall, while there are certainly challenges involved in selling bottled water in the Sahara, it is possible for Poland Spring to make money in this region if it is able to overcome these challenges and establish a successful business model."

The Sahara is a region in Africa that is known for its hot and dry climate. This means that the demand for water will be high in this region, as people will need to stay hydrated. Since Poland Spring is a well-known brand and has a good reputation for producing quality bottled water, it is reasonable to assume that it can make money in the Sahara by selling their bottled water. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

The natural springs provide a unique flavor and mineral content to the water, and the brand has been successful in the US market.\n\nNext, we have to consider the Sahara. The Sahara is a desert region in Africa that is known for its extreme heat, dryness, and lack of water sources. While there are oases and groundwater reserves in some parts of the Sahara, the vast majority of the region is uninhabitable and unsuitable for agriculture or other human activities.\n\nGiven these facts, it might seem unlikely that Poland Spring could make money in the Sahara. However, there are a few factors to consider.\n\nFirst, bottled water is a global industry that is expected to continue growing in the coming years. As more people become aware of the importance of hydration and the dangers of poor water quality, they are likely to turn to bottled water as a convenient and reliable source of hydration.\n\nSecond, while the Sahara may not be suitable for agriculture or other human activities, there are still people living in the region who need water. These include nomadic herders, tourists, and workers in remote mining or oil extraction operations.\n\nFinally, it is possible that Poland Spring could leverage its reputation as a premium, natural spring water brand to differentiate itself from other bottled water brands in the Sahara. By emphasizing the quality and purity of its water, Poland Spring could appeal to consumers who are willing to pay more for a premium product.\n\nOverall, while it may be challenging for Poland Spring to make money in the Sahara, it is not impossible. With careful planning, targeted marketing, and a focus on quality, Poland Spring could succeed in this challenging market."

Poland Spring is a brand of bottled water that is sourced from different natural springs in the US. \n\nNext, we need to consider the Sahara, which is a desert region in North Africa known for its extreme heat and dryness. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that Poland Spring may not be able to make money in the Sahara due to the lack of natural springs in the region. However, the question does not specify if Poland Spring will source water from the Sahara or distribute their existing product in the region. \n\nAssuming the question refers to whether Poland Spring can make money by sourcing water from the Sahara, the answer is no. The Sahara is one of the driest places on Earth and does not have any natural freshwater sources. Therefore, it would be highly unlikely for Poland Spring to find a viable water source in the region. \n\nHowever, if the question refers to whether Poland Spring can make money by distributing their existing product in the Sahara, the answer is yes. While the Sahara may not have any natural freshwater sources, people who live in the region still need access to drinking water. Bottled water from Poland Spring could be a viable option for those living or traveling through the Sahara, and Poland Spring could potentially make money by selling their product in the region. \n\nIn summary, the answer to this question depends on the interpretation of the question and the specific details of Poland Spring's business plan."
