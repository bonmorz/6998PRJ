Gluten is a protein found in certain grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. All-purpose flour is typically made from wheat, which means it contains gluten. Therefore, all-purpose flour is not safe for someone who has celiac disease. The answer is (B) no. \n\nIt is crucial for individuals with celiac disease to strictly avoid gluten in their diet to prevent further damage to their small intestine. Instead of all-purpose flour, they can use gluten-free flour alternatives such as rice flour, almond flour, or coconut flour in their cooking and baking."

People with celiac disease must avoid gluten in their diet to prevent damage to their digestive system.\n\nAll-purpose flour is made from wheat, which contains gluten. Therefore, it is not safe for someone with celiac disease to consume. This answer is (B) - no, it is not safe. \n\nTo further explain, consuming foods containing gluten triggers an immune response in people with celiac disease, which can lead to inflammation and damage to the small intestine. This damage can make it difficult for the body to absorb nutrients and lead to other health problems. For these reasons, people with celiac disease must avoid all sources of gluten in their diet, including all-purpose flour. They can use gluten-free flours made from alternative grains such as rice, corn, or potato starch to bake or cook."

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, triggers an immune response that damages the lining of the small intestine.

Therefore, people with celiac disease must follow a strict gluten-free diet. \n\nSecond, what is all purpose flour? It is a type of flour made from wheat that is commonly used in baking and cooking. Since it is made from wheat, it contains gluten. \n\nNow, putting these two pieces of information together, we can determine that all purpose flour is not safe for someone with celiac disease. The gluten in the flour will trigger an autoimmune response and cause damage to the small intestine. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no."
