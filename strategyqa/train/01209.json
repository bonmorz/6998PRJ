Now, we need to determine if Alan Greenspan has lived through at least 13 presidents. Alan Greenspan was born on March 6, 1926. As of 2021, there have been 46 U.S. presidents. To determine how many presidents Alan Greenspan has lived through, we need to subtract 1926 from the year the 13th president took office. The 13th U.S. president was Millard Fillmore, who took office on July 9, 1850. Subtracting 1926 from 1850 gives us -76, indicating that Alan Greenspan has lived through at least 13 U.S. presidents. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

So, the question is asking if Alan Greenspan has lived through 13 or more presidents. \n\nAlan Greenspan was born on March 6, 1926. As of 2021, he is still alive, but we need to figure out how many U.S. presidents have been in office during his lifetime. \n\nThere have been a total of 45 U.S. presidents, including the current president Joe Biden. If we subtract the number of presidents who were in office before Greenspan was born, we can determine the number of presidents he has lived through. \n\nBefore March 6, 1926, there were a total of 28 U.S. presidents. Therefore, if we subtract 28 from 45, we get 17. This means that Greenspan has lived through 17 U.S. presidents. \n\nSince 17 is more than a baker's dozen (13), the answer to the question is \"yes\" - Greenspan has lived through at least a baker's dozen of U.S. presidents."
