This is a figurative language meaning that can his number of marriages be counted using only two hands or less. Therefore, we need to count the number of marriages Larry King has had. \n\nResearching, we find out that Larry King was married eight times. Now, we need to determine if eight is more than or less than ten, which is the minimum number of feet needed to count up to eight. \n\nSince eight is less than ten, we can conclude that Larry King's marriages can be counted on two feet or less. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."
