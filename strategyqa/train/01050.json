One of the main requirements is obtaining a culinary degree or completing formal culinary training. Michael Jordan has not publicly expressed any interest in pursuing a culinary degree, but it's possible he may have completed formal culinary training privately.\n\nSecondly, aspiring cooks need to pass their food safety and sanitation certifications. These certifications ensure they know how to handle and prepare food properly to prevent customers from getting sick. It's uncertain whether or not Michael Jordan has these certifications.\n\nAdditionally, cooks need to have relevant work experience in the industry. Michael Jordan may have the opportunity to work in a restaurant or culinary environment, which would provide him with relevant experience in the industry.\n\nLastly, becoming a professional cook in America also requires a work visa, which allows foreigners to work in the country legally.
