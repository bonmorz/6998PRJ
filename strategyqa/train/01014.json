This is confirmed by historical records and is widely accepted as the true origin of the town's name.\n\nSecond, we need to look at the history of the Vikings. The Vikings were a seafaring people from Scandinavia who lived from approximately the 8th to the 11th century. While they had a significant impact on European history, they did not have a presence in Oklahoma or the United States as a whole. There is no evidence to suggest that the Vikings influenced the naming of any towns in Oklahoma or elsewhere in the United States.\n\nBased on these facts, we can confidently say that the answer to this question is (B) no, Norman Oklahoma is not named after a Viking."
