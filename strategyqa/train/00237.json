Katharine Hepburn was an American actress who was active in the film industry from the 1930s to the 1990s.

Based on the fact that she was an actress who was active before the development of the AirTrain JFK (which opened in 2003, the same year she passed away), it is safe to assume that she did not ever ride the AirTrain JFK. \n\nFurthermore, as Katharine Hepburn was born in 1907, it is possible that she would not have been physically capable of riding the AirTrain JFK due to her age and any potential health concerns she may have had at the time. \n\nTherefore, based on these factors, it is safe to answer the question with option (B) no."

The AirTrain JFK, on the other hand, is a modern transportation system located in New York City that connects John F.

Firstly, we know that the AirTrain JFK was built after Katharine Hepburn's death, meaning that she could not have physically used the train. Secondly, even if Katharine Hepburn were alive, it is doubtful that she would have needed to ride the AirTrain JFK, as it is typically used by passengers traveling to or from JFK airport. While we do not know why she would or would not have needed to travel to JFK airport, everything indicates that she could not have ridden the AirTrain JFK.
