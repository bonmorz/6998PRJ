It is essential to research and analyze any statements or interviews he has given about Trump or his administration.\n\nFinally, based on our research, if Dustin Hoffman has publicly criticized or spoken out against Trump, it is unlikely that he will vote for him in 2020.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis above, the answer is (B) no, Dustin Hoffman will not likely vote for Trump in 2020."

Next, we need to consider Trump's policies and actions as president, and how they align or conflict with Hoffman's beliefs. Trump's policies, such as his views on immigration, climate change, and healthcare, have been widely criticized by the Democratic party, of which Hoffman is a member. Additionally, Hoffman has criticized Trump in the past, stating that he is \"terrified\" of him and believes that he is a danger to the country. Based on these factors, it is unlikely that Hoffman would vote for Trump in 2020, making the answer (B) no."

As a well-known Hollywood actor and liberal activist, it is unlikely that he would support Donald Trump, who is known for his conservative policies and controversial statements.\n\nSecond, we can look at any public statements Hoffman has made about the upcoming election. If he has expressed support for a particular candidate or party, that would give us a clearer indication of his voting intentions. However, as of this writing, there is no evidence that Hoffman has publicly endorsed Trump or any other candidate.\n\nFinally, we can consider the general political climate and issues at play in the 2020 election. This election is likely to be highly polarized, with Democrats and Republicans fiercely opposing each other on a range of issues from healthcare and immigration to foreign policy and climate change. Given Dustin Hoffman's progressive values and history of supporting Democratic candidates and causes, it is unlikely that he would vote for Trump.\n\nTherefore, based on these factors, it is safe to say that Dustin Hoffman is unlikely to vote for Trump in 2020. The correct answer is (B) no."

Based on available information, Hoffman has been a vocal supporter of liberal and progressive causes throughout his career. He has donated to the Democratic Party and endorsed Democratic candidates in the past.\n\nAdditionally, Hoffman has been openly critical of President Trump and his policies. In a 2017 interview with The Guardian, he stated, \"I think he's [Trump] terrible. I think he's really dangerous.\" \n\nBased on this information, it is highly unlikely that Hoffman would vote for Trump in 2020. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no."

He is an American actor and filmmaker who has been a vocal and active supporter of the Democratic Party and liberal causes.

In 2018, he referred to Trump as a \"crackpot\" in an interview with The Guardian. He also participated in anti-Trump protests, such as the Women's March in 2017.\nBased on this information, we can confidently say that Dustin Hoffman would not vote for Trump in 2020.

However, we can make an educated guess based on his past political activities and affiliations, if any. \n\nA quick online search reveals that Hoffman has donated money to various Democratic candidates and causes over the years. In 2008, he endorsed Barack Obama for president and spoke at the Democratic National Convention. In 2016, he supported Hillary Clinton and donated to her campaign. \n\nGiven this information, it seems unlikely that Hoffman would vote for Donald Trump in 2020, who is a Republican and his policies and demeanor have been heavily criticized by Democratic leaders like Hoffman. None of Donald Trump's policies could be linked with Hoffman's sensitivities, he is known for his democracy and social welfare concerns. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, as it is not expected that Dustin Hoffman will vote for Donald Trump in 2020."

While some people may support him based on his personality or rhetoric, ultimately voting is often influenced by the issues that a candidate stands for. Trump has been criticized for his handling of issues related to race, immigration, and the COVID-19 pandemic, among other things.\n\nGiven these factors, it seems unlikely that Dustin Hoffman would vote for Trump in the 2020 election. While it is always possible that someone could change their political views or support a different candidate than what might be expected based on past behavior, based on the available information it appears that the answer to this question is (B) no."

However, being a celebrity does not necessarily mean that one is politically aligned with any particular party or candidate. Therefore, we cannot assume anything about Dustin Hoffman's political views or voting preferences based solely on his profession. \n\nNext, we need to look at Dustin Hoffman's political history and statements. While he has spoken out on political issues in the past, he has not publicly endorsed any candidates or parties. Additionally, there is no information on his social media or interviews to suggest that he would support Trump in the 2020 election. \n\nFinally, it is important to note that voting preferences are personal and can change over time. Even if Dustin Hoffman had voted for Trump in the previous election, it does not necessarily mean that he will do the same in the upcoming election. \n\nTaking all of these factors into consideration, we can confidently conclude that Dustin Hoffman is not likely to vote for Trump in 2020. Therefore, answer (B) is correct."
