It was built by the Nayakar dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire and later occupied by the Bijapur Sultanate, the Mughals, and the British.\n\nNext, we need to consider the distribution and habitat of grizzly bears. Grizzly bears are primarily found in North America, specifically in Canada and the United States. They typically inhabit forests, mountains, and meadows.\n\nBased on these facts, it is highly unlikely that occupants of Vellore Fort needed to defend themselves from grizzly bears. Grizzly bears are not native to India and are not found in the region where Vellore Fort is located. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
