                "content": "Professional boxing involves a lot of physical contact, and blows to the face and head are common, which can cause dental injuries. Boxers are at risk of chipping and breaking their teeth, and injuries to their lips, tongue, and gums. Moreover, in the long run, repetitive blows to the head can lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease.\n\nTherefore, it is safe to say that professional boxers cannot expect to have low dental bills as their mouths are prone to injuries, which may require expensive dental treatments. So, the correct answer is (B) no."

Professional boxers engage in high-intensity physical activity, which includes punching and being punched in the head and face. The intense force caused by these punches can cause dental trauma, and can lead to tooth fractures, displacement, and even tooth loss. \n\nNext, we need to understand dental bills. Dental bills can include costs for routine exams, cleanings, fillings, root canals, crowns, bridges, and other procedures. Dental costs can vary depending on the severity of the dental issue and the location of the dental clinic.\n\nPutting these two ideas together, we can see that professional boxers are at risk of dental trauma, which could result in costly dental procedures. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, professional boxers cannot expect to have low dental bills due to the risk of dental trauma associated with their sport."

                "content": "Professional boxers are athletes who engage in a sport that involves physical contact, including blows to the head and face. During training and fights, boxers frequently experience the impact of punches, jabs, and hooks. The force of these blows can cause injuries and trauma to various parts of the body, including the teeth and gums.\n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that professional boxers can expect to have low dental bills. The continuous trauma to the mouth can lead to chipped, broken, or knocked-out teeth, as well as cuts, bruises, and other gum injuries. Boxers may need to undergo dental procedures such as fillings, crowns, root canals, or dental implants to repair damaged teeth or replace missing ones.\n\nFurthermore, boxers are also prone to developing bruxism, a condition where they clench or grind their teeth, especially during training or competition. Over time, bruxism can wear down the tooth enamel, cause jaw pain and headaches, and increase the risk of dental issues such as cavities, gum disease, and tooth decay. Treating bruxism may involve wearing a custom-made mouthguard or getting orthodontic treatment.\n\nIn summary, professional boxers are at high risk of dental injuries and oral health problems, and therefore, cannot expect to have low dental bills."
