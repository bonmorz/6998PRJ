The US census is a nationwide count of every person living in the United States, conducted every ten years since 1790. The census is used to determine how many seats each state gets in the House of Representatives and to allocate federal funding for various programs.\n\nNow, let's apply this knowledge to the question. The question asks if an anchovy born in 2020 can survive the 25th US census. Since an anchovy is a fish and not a person, it is not counted in the US census. Therefore, the answer is no, an anchovy born in 2020 cannot survive the 25th US census."

This means that the census was conducted 30 years ago, and not in the year 2020 when the anchovy was born. \n\nTherefore, the anchovy born in 2020 cannot survive the 25th US census as the census has already taken place and is no longer applicable to the current year. This is why the correct answer is (B) no."

They are commonly used as food, either fresh or preserved.\n\nNext, we need to understand what the US census is. The US census is a national survey conducted every 10 years to gather information about the population of the United States. The purpose of the census is to count everyone living in the country and to gather information about their age, gender, and other demographic characteristics.\n\nNow, let's answer the question. Can an anchovy born in 2020 survive the 25th US census? The answer is no. The census is conducted only for humans living in the United States, and not for animals like anchovies. Therefore, an anchovy born in 2020 cannot survive the 25th US census, as it is not part of the population that is surveyed."

Even if the anchovy did survive until 2030, it is highly unlikely that it would be included in the US census, as the census only counts human residents of the country.\n7. So, the answer to the question is (B) no, an anchovy born in 2020 cannot survive the 25th US census."
