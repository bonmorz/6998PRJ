It is a term used to describe a race or competition that is so close that the winner can only be determined by analyzing a photograph taken at the finish line. So, if we apply this definition to the 1980 United States presidential election, we need to ask ourselves: Was this election so close that the winner could only be determined by analyzing a photograph taken at the finish line? \n\nThe answer is no. In the 1980 United States presidential election, the Republican candidate Ronald Reagan won a decisive victory over the Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter. Reagan won 489 electoral votes while Carter won only 49. Furthermore, Reagan won 51% of the popular vote while Carter won only 41%. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the 1980 United States presidential election result cannot be considered a photo finish."

A photo finish refers to a close finish in a race or competition where the difference between the competitors is too close to call with the naked eye.\n\n2. Did the 1980 United States presidential election have a close finish? \n\nAccording to the official results, Ronald Reagan won the 1980 election with 489 electoral votes to incumbent Jimmy Carter's 49 electoral votes. This is a clear majority victory for Reagan, indicating that the difference between the two candidates was not close enough to be considered a photo finish.\n\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer to the question is (B) no, the 1980 United States presidential election result cannot be considered a photo finish."

A photo finish is a term used in horse racing, track and field, and other sports to describe a situation where the competitors finish so closely together that a photograph is needed to determine the winner. \n\nNow, let's apply this definition to the 1980 United States presidential election. The election result was not determined by a photo finish in the literal sense, as it was not a physical competition. Instead, it was a political race in which the winner was determined by the electoral college. \n\nIn the 1980 election, Ronald Reagan won a total of 489 electoral votes, while incumbent president Jimmy Carter only received 49 electoral votes. This was a clear victory for Reagan, as he won by a landslide. \n\nTherefore, based on these facts, we can conclude that the answer to the question is (B) - no, the 1980 United States presidential election result cannot be considered a photo finish."
