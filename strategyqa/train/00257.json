It is not a store or a pet supply company that sells dog food products. Therefore, it is very unlikely that the NYPL sells Alpo products. To confirm this, we can check the NYPL's website or contact their customer service representative to ask about their products and services. However, based on the institution's nature and purpose, the answer is most likely \"no\" and that is the correct answer choice for this multiple-choice question."
