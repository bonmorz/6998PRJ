Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Geisel, was a famous American children's book author and illustrator who wrote classics such as \"The Cat in the Hat\" and \"Green Eggs and Ham\". \n\nNext, we need to consider how Dr. Seuss became famous. Dr. Seuss's fame was not entirely self-made. In the 1930s and 1940s, he worked as a political cartoonist and advertising illustrator, gaining some recognition in those fields. However, his big break in the children's book industry came in 1937 when he published his first children's book, \"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street\", which was well received by critics and readers. \n\nFrom there, Dr. Seuss continued to create beloved children's books that gained him more and more fame, eventually making him one of the most well-known children's authors of all time. However, this fame was largely due to the popularity of his books and the joy they brought to generations of children and families, rather than any self-promotion or marketing on Dr. Seuss's part. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, Dr. Seuss did not make himself famous. While he certainly worked hard to create his books and develop his unique style, his fame was largely a result of the quality and popularity of his work among readers of all ages, rather than any concerted effort on his part to become famous."

He is best known for his children's books, which have been translated into over 20 languages and sold over 600 million copies worldwide.\n\nNext, we need to examine the term \"make himself famous.\" To make oneself famous means to become widely known and recognized by others for a particular talent, achievement, or contribution.\n\nWith these definitions in mind, we can conclude that Dr. Seuss did not make himself famous. His fame came from his literary works, which were published and marketed by a publishing company. While Dr. Seuss certainly played a major role in the creation of his stories and characters, it was ultimately his publisher that promoted and distributed his books on a mass scale.\n\nFurthermore, Dr. Seuss did not enjoy immediate success. His first book, \"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,\" was rejected by over 20 publishers before finally being accepted. It was only after his second book, \"The Cat in the Hat,\" became a bestseller that Dr. Seuss began to gain widespread recognition and acclaim.\n\nIn conclusion, while Dr. Seuss was undoubtedly a talented writer and illustrator, he did not make himself famous. It was his works, in conjunction with his publisher's marketing efforts, that helped him achieve worldwide recognition and acclaim."
