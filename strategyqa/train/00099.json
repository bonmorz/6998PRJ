Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7, 1941. \n\nNancy Pelosi was born on March 26, 1940. So, in 1941, she was only a year and eight months old. Therefore, she was alive during the attack on Pearl Harbor, making the answer (A) yes."

Nancy Pelosi was born on March 26, 1940, which means that she was not alive during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Therefore, the answer is no. However, the question asks if she was the only woman to serve as U.S. Speaker of the House alive during the attack on Pearl Harbor, which means we need to look for another woman who served as U.S. Speaker of the House during that time. The only other woman to hold this position was Mary T. Norton, who served from 1931-1933. Therefore, the answer is actually (A) yes, Mary T. Norton was the only woman to serve as U.S. Speaker of the House alive during the attack on Pearl Harbor."

This is where it may get a bit tricky, as Nancy Pelosi wasn't actually born until March 26, 1940. So technically, she was not alive during the attack on Pearl Harbor. \nHowever, the question specifically asks if the only woman to serve as U.S. Speaker of the House was alive during the attack on Pearl Harbor. This means that the answer should refer to a different woman who served in this role. \nThat woman is actually Nancy Pelosi's predecessor, Rep. Barbara Ann Mikulski, who served as Speaker pro tempore for a brief period in 2010. She was indeed alive during the attack on Pearl Harbor. \nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, but it is important to note the distinction between Pelosi and Mikulski in this case."

Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7, 1941. Therefore, since Pelosi was not alive during this time, the answer to the question is (A) yes, she was not alive during the attack on Pearl Harbor."

Therefore, she was not alive during the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nLastly, we need to determine if there was any other woman who served as U.S. Speaker of the House who was alive during the attack on Pearl Harbor. The only woman who served as U.S. Speaker of the House before Nancy Pelosi was Jeannette Rankin. She served from 1917 to 1919 and again from 1941 to 1943. Jeannette Rankin was born on June 11, 1880 and she passed away on May 18, 1973. Thus, she was alive during the attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."
