Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Jesus would have studied railroad engineering in school. Additionally, there is no historical or biblical evidence to suggest that Jesus pursued any formal education or trade outside of his spiritual teachings. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no."

Secondly, the biblical accounts of Jesus' life do not mention him pursuing any type of formal education or career in engineering. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, Jesus did not go to school to study railroad engineering."
