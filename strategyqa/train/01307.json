Venus has an average surface temperature of 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius), which is hot enough to melt lead. This means that any snow on Venus would quickly melt.\n\nNext, we need to consider the atmosphere of Venus. Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere that is mostly composed of carbon dioxide. The atmosphere is also under extremely high pressure, which would make it difficult for a snowboarder to navigate.\n\nFinally, we need to consider the surface of Venus. Venus has a rocky, volcanic surface with many steep cliffs and craters. It would be difficult (if not impossible) for a snowboarder to find a suitable slope to ride on.\n\nBased on these factors, we can conclude that it would be very difficult (if not impossible) to snowboard on Venus. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

The surface temperature of Venus is incredibly hot, reaching up to 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius). \n\nNext, we need to consider the properties of snowboarding. Snowboarding involves sliding on snow using a snowboard attached to one's feet. Snowboarding requires snowy slopes, which are formed by precipitation of snow. \n\nFrom these considerations, it becomes clear that it would be incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to snowboard on Venus. \n\nFirstly, Venus does not have any snow or water ice on its surface. Its temperature is so high that even if there were any snow, it would melt instantly. So, snowboarding is not possible without snow. \n\nSecondly, the strong winds and thick atmosphere on Venus would make it difficult to stand on a board and maintain balance. The high temperature of Venus would also make any protective gear, such as goggles or helmets, useless.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that it would be extremely difficult to snowboard on Venus, hence the answer is (A) yes."

The atmosphere is so thick that it creates a runaway greenhouse effect, making the surface temperature hot enough to melt lead. The surface temperature of Venus is around 462 \u00b0C (864 \u00b0F). \n\nNow, let's consider snowboarding. Snowboarding is a winter sport that involves riding on a board over snow, usually on a ski slope. It requires cold temperature and snow to be performed. \n\nBased on the above information, it is clear that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to snowboard on Venus. The surface temperature is so hot that no snow would be present, and the atmosphere is so thick and corrosive that it would be dangerous to attempt any kind of activity on the surface. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, it would be difficult to snowboard on Venus."

Additionally, the atmospheric pressure on Venus is about 90 times greater than that of Earth. \n\nNow, let's consider snowboarding. Snowboarding is a winter sport that involves sliding down snow-covered slopes on a board. The snow usually needs to be reasonably firm, but not icy, for snowboarding to be possible. \n\nFrom the above facts, we can see that it would be highly unlikely that snow could exist on Venus because the surface temperature is far too high. It is also highly unlikely that there would be any surface features that could be used for snowboarding. \n\nFurthermore, because the atmospheric pressure on Venus is so high, any athlete attempting to snowboard would be crushed by the weight of the atmosphere before they could even begin sliding down the non-existent slope. \n\nTherefore, based on the above facts, we can conclude that it would not just be difficult, but impossible to snowboard on Venus. The correct answer is option (A), \"Yes, it would be difficult.\""

The surface temperature is over 460 degrees Celsius and the atmospheric pressure is approximately 90 times higher than Earth's. Snowboarding requires snow or ice, but Venus has a dry and lifeless surface with no evidence of frozen water or precipitation. \n\nFurthermore, the thick, toxic atmosphere of Venus would make it difficult for humans to survive there. The atmosphere is composed mostly of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, which are poisonous to humans. Even if a person were to wear a protective suit, the intense heat and pressure would make it impossible to snowboard. \n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to snowboard on Venus.

The surface temperature on Venus averages around 462\u00b0C, which is hotter than the melting point of lead. Also, the atmospheric pressure on Venus is around 90 times more than the Earth's atmosphere, which is equivalent to the pressure you would experience if you were 1 km deep in the ocean.\n\nNow, let's consider the act of snowboarding. Snowboarding requires a certain type of snow, which is typically light and fluffy. This type of snow is generated in cold temperatures and forms into ice crystals, which then become compacted into snowflakes. However, the conditions on Venus are such that it is unlikely that this type of snow or any kind of snow exists on its surface. Venus's atmosphere is made up of mostly carbon dioxide, which doesn't freeze at Venus's surface temperature. Instead, it has sulfuric acid clouds which rain acid. So, it would be impossible to snowboard on Venus.\n\nThus, the correct answer is (A) Yes, it would be difficult to snowboard on Venus."

Snowboarding is typically done on mountains or hills covered in snow, with the board gliding smoothly over the snow. However, on Venus, there is no snow or ice to snowboard on. The high temperatures and thick atmosphere would cause any snow or ice to melt immediately.
