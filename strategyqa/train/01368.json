In the absence of white blood cells, our body's immune system would be severely weakened and compromised, making it difficult for us to fight off any infections.

Their primary function is to protect the body against infections and diseases by identifying and destroying harmful pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Without white blood cells, the body would be completely defenseless against infections, which can be fatal if left untreated. \n\nTo understand this better, let's assume that a person's white blood cell count drops drastically due to radiation therapy or chemotherapy. This condition is known as leukopenia, and it weakens the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections. Even a minor infection that would usually be easily fought off by the immune system can turn life-threatening without enough white blood cells to fight it. \n\nIn severe cases of leukopenia, the body may not be able to fight infections at all, and the person can become severely ill or even die from a condition such as sepsis. Therefore, we can conclude that someone can die without white blood cells."
