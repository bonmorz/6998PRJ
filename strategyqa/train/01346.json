Seinfeld ran from 1989 to 1998 and has a total of 180 episodes. \nNext, we need to calculate how many days there are in a year. There are 365 days in a year. \nTo figure out if we can watch one episode every day for a year, we need to multiply the number of episodes by the number of days in a year. \n180 episodes x 1 day = 180 days \nSince 180 is less than 365, we can watch a new Seinfeld episode every day for 180 days. To watch for a full year (365 days), we would need at least 365 episodes, which Seinfeld does not have. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

Therefore, there are around 198 episodes of Seinfeld in total.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many days it would take to watch all the episodes. If we assume each episode is roughly 22 minutes long (excluding commercials), then to watch all 198 episodes, it would take approximately 4,356 minutes, or 72.6 hours.\n\nNow we need to calculate how many days it would take to watch a new Seinfeld episode every day for a year. There are 365 days in a year, so we would need 365 new episodes to watch. Since there are only 198 episodes of Seinfeld, we would run out of new episodes to watch after approximately 198/365ths of a year, which is around 0.54 years.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, you could not watch a new Seinfeld episode every day for a year as there are not enough episodes to last a whole year."
