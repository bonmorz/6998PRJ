Latitude refers to the angular distance measured in degrees north or south of the Equator, which is an imaginary line that circles the Earth at 0 degrees latitude. Without knowing the latitude, one cannot pinpoint the exact location of an area on Earth's surface. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, latitude is required to determine the coordinates of an area."

The most commonly used coordinate system for mapping the earth's surface is the geographic coordinate system, which uses latitude and longitude. Latitude is the angular distance measured north or south from the equator, which is defined as 0 degrees latitude. Longitude is the angular distance measured east or west from the prime meridian, which is defined as 0 degrees longitude.\n\nTherefore, latitude is required to determine the coordinates of an area because it provides the north-south component of the geographic coordinates. Without latitude, we would not know how far north or south an area is located and its position on the globe would be undefined. So, the correct answer to the given question is A."

Latitude is the angle between the equator and a point on the Earth's surface, measured in degrees. Longitude is the angle between the prime meridian and a point on the Earth's surface, also measured in degrees.\n\nIn order to accurately determine the coordinates of an area, both latitude and longitude are required. Latitude is essential because it determines the north-south position of a location on the Earth's surface. Without latitude, we wouldn't be able to distinguish between locations that are on the same longitude but at different distances from the equator.\n\nFor example, if we were trying to locate a city in the United States, knowing its longitude alone wouldn't be enough to pinpoint its exact location. We would need to know its latitude as well, in order to determine whether it's in the northern or southern half of the country.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to this question is (A) yes, latitude is required to determine the coordinates of an area."

Longitude, on the other hand, measures the distance from the Prime Meridian in degrees, with the Prime Meridian being 0\u00b0 and the International Date Line being 180\u00b0.\n\nTo determine the coordinates of an area, we need to know both the latitude and longitude of that area. The coordinates are typically represented as two numbers, with latitude being listed first, followed by longitude. For example, the coordinates for New York City are 40.7128\u00b0 N, 74.0060\u00b0 W.\n\nTherefore, latitude is indeed required to determine the coordinates of an area.
