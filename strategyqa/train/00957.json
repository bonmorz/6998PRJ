Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a historical novel from China that depicts the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history, which took place from 220-280 CE. Finally, the question asks if Naruhito's ancestors are the focus of Romance of the Three Kingdoms. \n\nBased on these facts, we can conclude that the answer is (B) no, because Naruhito and his ancestors are from Japan, and Romance of the Three Kingdoms is about Chinese history. The novel focuses on Chinese historical figures and events, not those of Japan. Therefore, Naruhito's ancestors are not the focus of Romance of the Three Kingdoms."

Now, let's think about the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. It is a 14th-century historical novel by Luo Guanzhong that tells the story of the turbulent years at the end of the Han dynasty and the three states that emerged from the chaos. The novel focuses on the historical figures and events of that era, such as Liu Bei, Cao Cao, and Sun Quan. None of these figures have any connection to Naruhito or his ancestors. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

Naruhito is not relevant to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms as it is a story set in China over 1,000 years before Naruhito's time. Naruhito's ancestors are also not mentioned in the novel, as it focuses on the heroes and villains of the Three Kingdoms period. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
