Cosmic Girls, also known as WJSN, is a South Korean-Chinese girl group formed in 2016 by Starship Entertainment and Yuehua Entertainment. \n\nNow, let's move on to League of Legends, which is a popular online multiplayer game. \n\nTo answer the question, we need to consider if Cosmic Girls have the necessary skills and knowledge to play League of Legends alone. Since we don't have any specific information regarding the gaming abilities of Cosmic Girls, we can assume that they could play League of Legends alone, just like any other individual who has the means to do so.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, Cosmic Girls could play League of Legends alone."

So, the question is asking if members of a K-pop girl group can play League of Legends alone. \n\nThe answer to this question is \"yes\" because there is no reason to suggest that being in a K-pop girl group would prevent someone from being able to play League of Legends alone. Playing video games alone is a common activity, and being part of a girl group does not change that. \n\nIt is important to note that just because they can play League of Legends alone does not necessarily mean they necessarily do or even like playing video games at all. However, the question only asks if they are capable of playing alone, and they certainly are."
