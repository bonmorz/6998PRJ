They are omnivorous scavengers and feed primarily on bottom-dwelling organisms such as algae, plant matter, small invertebrates, and other small bits of organic matter. While they may eat small fish, it is not their typical behavior or preferred food source.\n\nAdditionally, cory catfish are generally peaceful, community-oriented fish that are known to get along well with other fish in the tank. They are not known to be aggressive predators that will attack or prey upon other living fish.\n\nGiven these behaviors and tendencies, it is unlikely that a cory catfish would eat another living fish.

They are known for their scavenging behavior, feeding on leftover food and algae. \n\nNext, we need to understand their behavior towards other fish. Cory catfish are not aggressive and are generally compatible with other non-aggressive fish. They are unlikely to eat living fish, as they do not have the predatory instincts that many other fish species possess. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, a cory catfish is not likely to eat another living fish.

Cory catfish are peaceful bottom-dwelling fish that spend most of their time scavenging for food in the substrate. They are generally not aggressive towards other fish and prefer to live in groups rather than alone. \n\nBased on these characteristics, it is unlikely that cory catfish would eat another living fish. They are not known to be predatory and do not have the physical characteristics (such as sharp teeth or a large mouth) that would allow them to capture and eat larger fish. In fact, their diet consists mainly of algae, small invertebrates, and bits of organic matter that they find in the substrate. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no.

They are omnivores and their diet mainly consists of small aquatic organisms like algae, decaying plants, dead animals, and insects. They are not aggressive hunters and do not have a predatory behavior. \n\nFurthermore, cory catfish are relatively small in size compared to other fish species, making it unlikely for them to physically overpower or harm larger fish. Instead, they prefer to form schools and swim around their tank mates without causing any harm or disturbance. \n\nTherefore, based on these characteristics and behaviors, we can conclude that a cory catfish is unlikely to eat another living fish, making answer (B) the correct one."

They are scavengers and mainly feed on leftovers and debris at the bottom of the tank, as well as small insects or larvae. They rarely, if ever, show aggression towards other fish. \n\nEven though individual behavior can vary depending on the environment and the specific species of cory catfish, the general consensus is that they are not likely to eat other living fish. In fact, they may even help to keep the tank clean and healthy by eating organic matter and preventing the buildup of harmful bacteria.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, a cory catfish is not likely to eat another living fish."

They typically eat algae, leftover food, and small invertebrates like worms and shrimp. They may also occasionally snack on small, dead fish that they come across. \n\nHowever, cory catfish are generally peaceful and non-aggressive towards other fish. They are social and often kept in groups with other peaceful community fish. In fact, they're often recommended as good tankmates for other fish species because they help keep the tank clean and don't cause any trouble. \n\nSo based on this information, it's safe to say that a cory catfish is unlikely to eat another living fish. Their diet does not typically include live fish, and their behavior is not aggressive towards other fish. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no."

Cory catfish are bottom-dwelling fish that primarily feed on small invertebrates such as algae, small crustaceans, and insect larvae. They are not known to be aggressive predators or hunters.\n\nSecond, we need to consider the size and strength of a cory catfish compared to other fish that may be in the same tank. Cory catfish are relatively small and do not have the ability to overpower or consume larger fish. Therefore, it is unlikely that a cory catfish would intentionally eat another living fish.\n\nFinally, it's worth noting that every fish has its own unique personality and behavior. While it is not typical for cory catfish to eat other fish, there may be some individual cases where a cory catfish may display aggressive behavior towards other fish in the tank. However, this behavior is not common and should not be expected in most cases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, a cory catfish is not likely to eat another living fish."

They are generally peaceful and gentle in nature and tend to get along with other fish species. In fact, they are often used as a communal fish in aquariums as they can coexist with various types of fish.\n\nWhile it is true that catfish are known to eat small fish, it is highly unlikely that a cory catfish would do so. Firstly, cory catfish have small mouths that are not capable of taking in large prey. Additionally, their diet mainly consists of small particles and plant matter which they sift through the substrate to find. Any small fish that they come across are more likely to be ignored or considered as tank mates rather than prey.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, a cory catfish is not likely to eat another living fish."

They are not usually aggressive towards other fish or aquatic creatures. Instead, they often form symbiotic relationships with other species, such as shrimp, by cleaning their tails and bodies of parasites. \n\nBased on these facts, it is highly unlikely that a cory catfish would intentionally eat another living fish. They are not predators by nature, and their small mouths and lack of sharp teeth make it difficult for them to consume larger fish. So the correct answer is (B) no."
