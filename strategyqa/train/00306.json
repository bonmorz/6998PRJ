The 1936 Summer Olympics were held in Berlin, Germany, and were used by the Nazis as a propaganda tool to display their power to the world. Although there were efforts by some countries to boycott the Olympics due to Germany's racist policies, the Olympics went ahead as planned, with athletes from 49 countries competing. So, the answer to the question is \"no\", the Berlin Wall did not prevent any athletes from competing in the 1936 Summer Olympics."

Additionally, there is no historical evidence to suggest that any athletes were prevented from competing in the 1936 Olympics due to political barriers or other reasons. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no."

Therefore, it is impossible for the wall to have prevented any athletes from competing in the games. Also, during the 1936 Olympics, Germany, the host country, did not impose any restrictions on athletes based on their nationality or ethnicity, so all athletes who qualified were able to compete regardless of their origin.

Therefore, it could not have prevented athletes from competing in the 1936 Summer Olympics, which took place over 20 years before the wall was built. The 1936 Olympics were held in Berlin, Germany, and were famously used by the Nazi regime as propaganda to promote their ideology of Aryan superiority. While the Olympics themselves were not directly affected by the wall, there were controversies surrounding the participation of some countries, such as the boycott by African American athlete Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals. However, the wall did not exist during this time period, so the answer to the question is (B) no."
