A baker's dozen refers to 13, instead of the usual 12, which is often given by bakers to avoid being accused of shortchanging their customers. \n\nNow, we know that a Mac Truck is a large commercial truck that can range in length from 23 to 70 feet. The Golden Gate Bridge has 6 lanes, and each lane is approximately 11 feet wide. So, the total width of the bridge is 66 feet. \n\nIf we line up 13 Mac Trucks side by side, with each truck being about 23 feet long, we get a total length of 299 feet (13 x 23). This means that the trucks would not be able to fit on the bridge, as their combined length is greater than the width of the bridge.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes, a baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge."

According to the dimensions listed on the Mack Trucks website, a \"Model Anthem\" tractor is 10 feet and 8 inches in height with a weight of 35,000 to 63,000 pounds depending on the configuration. The Golden Gate Bridge has a height limit of 14 feet. Therefore, it is possible that a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks, each 10 feet and 8 inches high, could jam up the bridge. Additionally, the weight of the trucks could also be a factor, as too much weight could potentially cause damage to the structure of the bridge. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, a baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks could jam up the Golden Gate Bridge."

So we can assume that there would be 13 side by side Mac trucks. \n\nSecondly, the Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans across the Golden Gate Strait, which is approximately 1 mile wide. \n\nThirdly, according to the California Department of Transportation, the maximum weight limit for vehicles crossing the Golden Gate Bridge is 80,000 pounds. \n\nNow, let's calculate the weight of 13 side by side Mac trucks. According to the Mack Trucks website, their Pinnacle model, which is commonly used for highway hauling, has a maximum payload capacity of 55,000 pounds. Assuming the trucks are fully loaded, the total weight of 13 trucks would be 715,000 pounds (55,000 x 13). \n\nThis weight is well above the maximum weight limit for vehicles crossing the Golden Gate Bridge. Therefore, if 13 side by side Mac trucks attempted to cross the bridge, it would cause an obstruction and jam up the bridge, resulting in a \"yes\" answer to the question."

First, we need to know the width of a side by side Mac Truck. According to the Federal Highway Administration, the maximum width for a commercial vehicle is 102 inches. If we multiply that by 13, we get a total width of 1,326 inches (102 x 13). \n\nNext, we need to know the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. The roadway of the Golden Gate Bridge is 90 feet (1,080 inches) wide, with six lanes of traffic. According to the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District, each lane is approximately 11 feet (132 inches) wide.

According to the Mack Trucks website, the width of a Mack truck ranges from 96 to 102 inches. Let's take the average, which is 99 inches. \n\nTo convert 99 inches to feet, we divide by 12.
