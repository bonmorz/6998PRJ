Alexander Nevsky was a ruler and military commander from the 13th century in the northwestern region of Russia. He is known for his victories against invaders, particularly the Swedes and the Teutonic Knights. \n\nNow, we need to look at the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church's canon of saints. The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is an Eastern Catholic Church in full communion with the Roman Catholic Church. Like other Eastern Catholic Churches, they recognize a different set of saints compared to the Latin or Roman Catholic Church. \n\nAccording to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church's canon of saints, there is no mention of Alexander Nevsky as a recognized saint. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church does not recognize Alexander Nevsky as a saint."

The process involves extensive research, investigation, and verification of the person's life and works. The Church also looks for evidence of miracles that can be attributed to the person's intercession. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church has not recognized Alexander Nevsky as a saint because there is no official record of his canonization by the Catholic Church. If he had been recognized as a saint, we would have found his name listed in the official Catholic liturgical calendar, and there would have been religious celebrations in his honor. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church does not recognize Alexander Nevsky as a saint."
