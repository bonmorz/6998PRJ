Eminem is known for his career in music and has never expressed any interest or involvement in mathematics. Therefore, we can assume that he does not have the necessary skills and knowledge required to compete at the International Mathematical Olympiad.\n\nSecondly, the International Mathematical Olympiad is a highly competitive event that requires extensive training, preparation, and proficiency in mathematics. The contestants are usually the most talented and skilled students from around the world chosen through a rigorous selection process by their respective countries. Thus, it is highly unlikely that Eminem, who is not a student, will be allowed to compete in the International Mathematical Olympiad.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the factors mentioned above, it is safe to say that Eminem would not perform well at the International Mathematical Olympiad. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

The International Mathematical Olympiad is a competition that tests mathematical skills and problem-solving abilities. To perform well at the Olympiad, one requires a strong understanding of mathematical concepts and the ability to apply them in complex problems. \n\nWhile Eminem may be a talented musician and lyricist, there is no evidence to suggest that he possesses the necessary skills to perform well at the Olympiad. It is possible that he may have an interest in mathematics, but without any evidence of his mathematical abilities or training, it would be difficult to assume that he could compete at the Olympiad level.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, as Eminem's skills and expertise lie in a different area than what is required in the International Mathematical Olympiad."
