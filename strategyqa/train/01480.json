When they sting, they leave behind a stinger and a venom sac, which causes pain and swelling. The honey bee dies after stinging because its venom sac and attached digestive tract are ripped from its body as it flies away.\n\nNow, answering the question, a single honey bee can sting only once in its life. As explained above, the bee dies after stinging, so it is not possible for it to sting multiple humans. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

                "content": "Firstly, honey bees usually do not sting unless they feel threatened or sense danger. Secondly, honey bees have a barbed stinger that gets stuck in the skin when they sting, causing them to die shortly afterwards. Thirdly, honey bees are social insects that live in colonies, and they release their alarm pheromones to signal danger or aggression to their fellow bees. Therefore, if a honey bee stings a human, it will release its alarm pheromones, which will attract other bees to the area to defend their colony. However, these bees will attack and sting the same person, rather than multiple humans. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, a single honey bee cannot sting multiple humans."

Therefore, if a bee stings a human, it will not be able to sting another human since it will no longer have a stinger.\n\nAdditionally, honey bees typically do not sting unless they feel threatened or provoked. Therefore, it is unlikely that a single bee would sting multiple humans unless those humans are all actively disturbing the same bee or hive.\n\nOverall, because a bee can only sting once and does not typically sting unless provoked, it is unlikely for a single honey bee to sting multiple humans. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no."

Therefore, it is unlikely for a single honey bee to sting multiple humans as it is unable to survive after stinging just one person. Additionally, honey bees are not known to be aggressive creatures and would only sting in defense of their hive or themselves when provoked. Therefore, it is highly unlikely for a single honey bee to sting multiple humans even if it had the opportunity to do so. Hence, option (B) is the correct answer."

Honey bees are equipped with a barbed stinger that is attached to their abdomen. \n\nWhen a honey bee stings, the barbed stinger gets embedded in the skin of the target, along with the venom sac that is attached to it. \n\nAfter the stinger is embedded, the honey bee will typically try to fly away. In doing so, the barbs on the stinger will cause it to tear away from the bee's abdomen. \n\nUnfortunately, this also means that the bee will die shortly after stinging, as its internal organs are attached to the stinger. \n\nSo, can a single honey bee sting multiple humans? The answer is no. Once a honey bee has stung and lost its stinger, it will no longer be able to sting again. \n\nTherefore, each honey bee can only sting once and cannot sting multiple humans."
