This means she has a significant amount of money at her disposal.\n\nSecond, we need to determine the cost of a Bugatti luxury car. As of 2021, the cost of a Bugatti Chiron is approximately $3 million. This means that Oprah Winfrey could theoretically buy dozens of her staff Bugatti luxury cars, as her net worth is significantly higher than the cost of multiple Bugattis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes, Oprah Winfrey could buy dozens of her staff Bugatti luxury cars."

According to Forbes, Oprah's net worth in 2021 is estimated to be $2.7 billion. \n\nThe next thing we need to know is the cost of a Bugatti luxury car. The average cost of a Bugatti car is around $3.5 million. \n\nNow, let's do some calculations. If Oprah wanted to buy 24 Bugatti cars for her staff (dozens usually means 24), it would cost her 24 x $3.5 million = $84 million. \n\nSince Oprah's net worth is $2.7 billion, she has more than enough money to buy dozens of Bugatti cars for her staff.

According to reports, she has over 400 employees. Dozens typically means multiples of 12, so let's assume that dozens means 24 cars. \n\nIf Oprah were to purchase 24 Bugatti cars, and the average cost were around $5 million per car, it would cost her $120 million. While this is a significant amount of money, it is less than 5% of her net worth. Therefore, the answer is yes - Oprah Winfrey could buy dozens of her staff Bugatti luxury cars if she wanted to."

Multiplying the cost of one Bugatti Chiron ($3 million) by 24 results in $72 million. \n\nSince Oprah's net worth is $2.7 billion, she could certainly afford to spend $72 million on dozens of Bugatti cars for her staff.
