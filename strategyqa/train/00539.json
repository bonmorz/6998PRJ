However, the question asks if the CEO of Nissan is an internationally wanted fugitive. It is important to note that the question does not specify which CEO of Nissan we are referring to.\n\nIn the past, the CEO of Nissan was Carlos Ghosn. In 2018, Ghosn was arrested in Japan for allegedly underreporting his income and using company assets for personal gain. He spent over 100 days in a Japanese prison before being released on bail. However, on December 29, 2019, Ghosn escaped from Japan and fled to Lebanon. \n\nDespite being under house arrest in Japan and banned from leaving the country, Ghosn fled Japan using a private jet. Since then, he has been an internationally wanted fugitive, with the Japanese government issuing an Interpol warrant for his arrest. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to this question is (A) yes, as Carlos Ghosn, the former CEO of Nissan, is an internationally wanted fugitive."
