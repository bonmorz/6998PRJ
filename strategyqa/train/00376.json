The Chinese zodiac features twelve animals, one for each year in a twelve-year cycle. These animals are: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. Five of these animals are quadrupeds: ox, tiger, rabbit, horse, and sheep. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, quadrupeds are represented on the Chinese calendar."

The Chinese calendar associates each year with an animal in a 12-year cycle. These 12 animals are all quadrupeds: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. So, each year on the Chinese calendar is represented by a specific quadruped animal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, quadrupeds are represented on the Chinese calendar."
