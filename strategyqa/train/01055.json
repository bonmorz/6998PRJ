A lullaby is a soothing song, typically sung to young children before they go to sleep. Its purpose is to calm and soothe the listener and help them fall asleep.\n\nGiven this information, it is highly unlikely that a lullaby would wake Hellen Keller up. Since she was deaf and blind, she would not be able to hear the lullaby, and even if she did feel the vibrations from the singing, she would not understand its purpose as a lullaby. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, a lullaby would not be enough to wake Hellen Keller up."

Therefore, a lullaby could not wake her up because she could not hear it. \n\nAdditionally, Keller relied heavily on touch and smell in her communication and understanding of the world. So, even if someone were to tap her or use a strong scent to wake her up, she would still not be able to understand what was happening without any visual or auditory cues.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, a lullaby would not be enough to wake Hellen Keller up."

She lost her sight and hearing when she was 19 months old, and she communicated primarily using sign language. \n\nNow, let's focus on the question. The question asks if a lullaby would be enough to wake Hellen Keller up. Based on what we know about her, we can conclude that the answer is no. \n\nSince Hellen Keller was deaf, she would not be able to hear a lullaby. Even if the lullaby was played very loudly, she would still not be able to hear it. Additionally, Hellen Keller relied on touch to communicate. Therefore, it is unlikely that the physical sensation of a lullaby would wake her up. \n\nOverall, Hellen Keller's deafness and reliance on touch make it unlikely that a lullaby would be enough to wake her up, so the correct answer is (B) no."

This means that she had lost her hearing and vision abilities. \n\nNow, when we talk about a lullaby, it is a type of music that is often used to put babies to sleep. It is typically soft, gentle and soothing in nature. Therefore, it is unlikely that a lullaby would be able to wake up someone who cannot hear it in the first place. \n\nMoreover, Helen Keller's wakefulness would not be controlled by external stimuli like sound since she would have been unable to perceive it. As a result, a lullaby would not be enough to wake up Helen Keller. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
