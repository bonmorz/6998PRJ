So, based on this common understanding, we can say that the tongue is part of the head of an animal. This makes answer (A) correct. Answer (B) would be incorrect because, as we just discussed, the tongue is located in the head of animals."

The tongue is a muscular organ located within the oral cavity (mouth) of most animals. It is typically used for tasting, swallowing, and vocalization. Since the tongue is located within the oral cavity, which is part of the head, we can safely conclude that the tongue is indeed part of a creature's head. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."
