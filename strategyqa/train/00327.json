While guns commonly used in shooting sports, such as rifles and pistols, use bullets, there are other shooting sports that use different types of weapons that don't always involve bullets. \n\nFor example, archery is a shooting sport that uses a bow and arrow to hit targets. Similarly, air rifles and air pistols, which use compressed air or gas to propel pellets, are also used in shooting sports.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that not all shooting sports involve bullets, making option (B) the correct answer."
