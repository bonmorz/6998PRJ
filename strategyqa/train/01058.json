Michael Vick is a former professional American football quarterback who served 21 months in federal prison for running a dogfighting ring. Next, we need to know what PETA is. PETA stands for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a nonprofit organization that advocates for animal rights. Finally, we need to determine if Michael Vick is on PETA's hypothetical blacklist. The answer is yes. PETA has stated that they have a \"do-not-adopt list\" of people who have been convicted of animal cruelty, and Michael Vick is on that list. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

Given that PETA is a well-known animal rights organization that is very vocal against animal abuse, it is highly likely that they would include him on their hypothetical blacklist.\n\nTo validate this reasoning, we can search for news articles or statements from PETA that mention Michael Vick. A quick search online confirms that PETA has indeed included Michael Vick on their blacklist of people who are banned from adopting animals from their organization due to his previous actions. In fact, PETA has been very outspoken about their disdain for Vick, even after he completed his prison sentence and returned to the NFL. Therefore, we can confidently say that the answer to the question is (A) yes, Michael Vick is on PETA's hypothetical blacklist."
