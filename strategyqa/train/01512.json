It began in the 4th century when the Roman Emperor Constantine adopted Christianity as the official religion of Rome. \n\nNow, let's explore the role of donkeys in the birth story of Jesus. According to the Bible, Mary and Joseph traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem on a donkey. When they arrived, there were no rooms available at the inn, so they ended up staying in a stable, where Mary gave birth to Jesus. The Bible does not specifically mention donkeys, but it is a widely popular interpretation that they were present on that journey.\n\nSo, to answer the question, Donkeys are not explicitly a part of Christmas celebrations, but they do play a significant role in the Nativity story, which is the basis for the whole holiday. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

In Mexican culture, it is said that Mary and Joseph traveled to Bethlehem on a donkey, which is why the animal is often included in Mexican nativity scenes called \"nacimientos.\" Additionally, in some European countries, it is also common to see donkeys in Christmas parades and processions.\n\nTherefore, based on the biblical account of the Christmas story and the cultural traditions associated with the holiday, we can conclude that donkeys are indeed part of Christmas celebrations.

One of the most well-known animals associated with Christmas is the reindeer, which pulls Santa Claus's sleigh. Another animal that is associated with Christmas is the sheep and the ox, who are often depicted in Nativity scenes. \n\nNow, when it comes to donkeys, they are also associated with Christmas celebrations. In the Nativity story, Mary and Joseph travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem on a donkey, as there was no room for them in the inn. The donkey, therefore, played an essential role in getting Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem and thus in the birth of Jesus. \n\nMoreover, Christmas carols and songs often refer to the donkey as well. For example, the song \"The Little Drummer Boy\" includes the lyrics, \"I played my drum for him, Pa rum pum pum pum, I played my best for him, Pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, Then he smiled at me, Pa rum pum pum pum, me and my drum,\" which makes reference to the donkey carrying Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem. \n\nTherefore, based on these explanations, we can say that donkeys are indeed part of Christmas celebrations, and the answer to the question is (A) yes."
