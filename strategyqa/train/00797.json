In 1945, there was no federal law regarding the minimum age to purchase cigarettes. However, some states had their own laws. \n\nAccording to the website of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, at least 12 states had a legal minimum age of 21 to purchase cigarettes in 1945. These states were Arkansas, California, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n\nTherefore, if Eric Clapton was born in one of these 12 states, his mother would not have been able to legally purchase cigarettes as she would have been under 21 years old at the time of his birth. \n\nHence, the answer is (A) yes, Eric Clapton's mother would hypothetically be unable to legally purchase cigarettes in the USA at his birth if he was born in one of these 12 states."

The legal age to purchase cigarettes in the USA was 18 years old until December 2019, when it was raised to 21 years old.\n3. At the time of Eric Clapton's birth in 1945, the legal age to purchase cigarettes in the USA was not standardized, as it was set by individual states and ranged from 18 to 21 years old.\n4. In some states at that time, the legal age to purchase cigarettes was already 21 years old, which means that Eric Clapton's mother may have been unable to legally purchase cigarettes in those states.\n5. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes, Eric Clapton's mother hypothetically may have been unable to legally purchase cigarettes in the USA at his birth."

Therefore, she would not have been legally allowed to purchase cigarettes in most states in the USA. Hence, the answer is (A) yes."

In 1945, the legal age to purchase cigarettes in most states was 18, although some states allowed sales to individuals as young as 16. \nNow, let's assume that Eric Clapton's mother was under the age of 18 at his birth.

In most states, the age of majority is 18. \n\nTherefore, at the time of Eric Clapton's birth, his mother would have been considered a minor if she was younger than 18.

At that time, the legal age to purchase cigarettes was determined by individual states and ranged from 16-21. However, since the question is asking about Eric Clapton's mother specifically, we need to consider the age at which women were legally allowed to smoke in the USA. \nIt wasn't until the 1920s that women smoking cigarettes became acceptable in the USA. Prior to that, it was widely frowned upon and deemed inappropriate for women. By the 1940s, women smoking was more commonplace, but there were still societal stigmas attached to it. \nHowever, there were no laws prohibiting women from smoking in the USA at the time of Eric Clapton's birth. Therefore, Eric Clapton's mother hypothetically would have been able to legally purchase cigarettes in the USA at his birth. \nHowever, it's important to note that smoking during pregnancy was not yet linked to negative health effects on babies. It wasn't until the 1960s that the dangers of smoking during pregnancy were discovered, and warnings began appearing on cigarette packages."

Therefore, if Eric Clapton's mother tried to buy cigarettes after this law was passed in her state, and if it raised the legal age to 21, then she would not be legally allowed to purchase cigarettes.

This information, however, does not help us determine whether his mother would be unable to purchase cigarettes in the USA. \n\nTo answer the question, we need to consider the legal age to purchase cigarettes in the USA at the time of Eric Clapton's birth. In 1945, the legal age to purchase cigarettes in the USA varied by state. Some states had no age restrictions, while others set the age at 16, 18, or even 21. \n\nHowever, in 1984, the United States Congress passed the federal Uniform Drinking Age Act, which effectively prohibited the sale of tobacco products to anyone under the age of 18. This law applies to all states and US territories.\n\nTherefore, if we assume that Eric Clapton's mother was unable to legally purchase cigarettes in the USA at his birth, then the answer is (A) yes. This is because the federal law prohibiting the sale of tobacco to anyone under the age of 18 did not exist at the time."
