The Gujarati script is a writing system used to write the Gujarati and Kutchi languages, primarily spoken in India. On the other hand, Kanji is a set of Chinese characters used in the Japanese writing system. \n\nNow we need to determine whether these two scripts belong to the same category. Firstly, they come from different regions, with Gujarati being from India and Kanji from Japan. They also have different origins, with Gujarati having evolved from the Brahmi script while Kanji is derived from Chinese characters. Furthermore, the structure and appearance of the characters in the Gujarati script are distinct from those in Kanji. \n\nBased on these factors, we can conclude that Gujarati and Kanji are not the same category of script. Hence the answer is (B) no."

This means that each character represents a word or idea, rather than a sound.\n\nSo, to answer the question, we need to compare the categories of the two scripts.

The answer is no because Gujarati script is an alphabetic script, while Kanji is an ideographic script. Alphabetic scripts are those that represent sounds, while ideographic scripts are those that represent ideas.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, since the Gujarati script and Kanji script belong to different categories of scripts."

Kanji, on the other hand, is a writing system used in Japan, consisting of Chinese characters used in a Japanese context.\n\nNext, we need to compare the two writing systems and see if they belong to the same category. A category of script refers to a broad group of writing systems that share similar features. For example, the Latin script and the Cyrillic script are both alphabetic scripts.\n\nIn this case, the Gujarati script and Kanji do not belong to the same category because they have different origins, structures, and characteristics. The Gujarati script is an abugida, which is a type of writing system that uses symbols for consonants and modifies them with diacritical marks to denote vowels. Kanji, on the other hand, is a logographic system, which uses symbols to represent words or concepts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, because the Gujarati script and Kanji belong to different categories of script."

To answer this, we need to consider what categories of scripts exist. There are several ways to categorize scripts, but one common method is based on the way characters are formed. For instance, alphabetic scripts use individual letters to represent sounds, while logographic scripts use characters to represent words or concepts. \nGujarati is an alphabetic script, which means each character represents a sound. Kanji, however, is a logographic script, in which each character represents a word or idea. \nSince Gujarati and Kanji use different methods for forming characters, they are not in the same category of script.

It belongs to the logographic family of scripts, which means that each character represents a meaningful unit of language (like a word or concept).\n\nNow, considering these facts, we can see that the Gujarati script and Kanji do not belong to the same category of scripts.

Moreover, the structure of Gujarati script is based on grouping consonants and vowels together to form syllables, while Kanji characters are standalone and represent words or concepts.\n\nTherefore, based on the differences in their origins, structures, and purposes, we can conclude that the Gujarati script is not the same category of script as Kanji.
