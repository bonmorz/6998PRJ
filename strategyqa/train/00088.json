According to the official website of the Marine Corps, individuals who meet certain requirements such as age, physical fitness, and educational qualifications, can enlist. However, there are some disqualifying factors, such as criminal records or certain medical conditions. \n\nNow, we need to focus on Christopher Walken. He is a well-known actor born in 1943, which means he is currently 78 years old. This age disqualifies him from enlisting in the Marine Corps, as the maximum age for enlisting is 28 years old. \n\nTherefore, based on the age factor alone, we can conclude that the answer is (B) no, Christopher Walken cannot enlist in the United States Marine Corps."

This includes being at least 17 years old (with parental consent) and no older than 29.5 years old at the time of enlistment. \n\nHowever, Christopher Walken was born on March 31, 1943, which means he is currently 77 years old.

To be eligible, one must meet certain minimum requirements such as being a US citizen or permanent resident, passing a medical exam and physical fitness test, having a high school diploma or equivalent, and being between the ages of 17-29.\n\nNow, let's focus on Christopher Walken. He was born in Queens, New York City, in 1943, which means he is currently 78 years old. This makes him ineligible for enlisting in the US Marine Corps as the maximum age limit for enlisting is 29. \n\nAdditionally, even if Walken were still under 29, it's unlikely that he would be allowed to enlist given his profession as an actor. There are certain exemptions to enlistment rules for professionals in fields like medicine or law, but not for actors. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to this question is (B) no - Christopher Walken could not enlist in the United States Marine Corps."
