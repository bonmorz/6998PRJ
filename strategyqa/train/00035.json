A standard chessboard has 64 squares in total. \n\nNow, we need to calculate the volume of one pea pod and compare it to the total volume of the chessboard. Assuming all pea pods have the same volume, we only need to calculate the volume of one pea pod. \n\nLet's say each pea pod has a volume of 1 cubic centimeter (this is only an assumption, it could be different). We multiply this by the number of pea pods we have, which is 20. \n\n1 cubic centimeter x 20 = 20 cubic centimeters \n\nNow, we need to compare the volume of the pea pods to the volume of the chessboard. Assuming the chessboard is a perfect cube, its volume is given by: \n\n64 squares x (1 cm)^3 = 64 cubic centimeters \n\nAs we can see, the total volume of the pea pods (20 cubic centimeters) is significantly less than the volume of the chessboard (64 cubic centimeters).
