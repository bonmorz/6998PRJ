Dynamite is a high explosive substance that was first invented by Alfred Nobel in the late 19th century. \n\nNext, we need to establish the time period of the Middle Ages. The Middle Ages, also known as the Medieval period, began in the 5th century and ended in the 15th century. \n\nGiven these timelines, we can conclude that dynamite was not used during Middle Ages warfare. In fact, explosives in general were not commonly used until the later part of the Medieval period, and even then, they were not as advanced or widely used as they are today. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, dynamite was not used during Middle Ages warfare."
