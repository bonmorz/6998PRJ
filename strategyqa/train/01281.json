To answer this question, we need to look at Nobel's publications. Nobel was known for his contributions to science, particularly his invention of dynamite.

This book was considered controversial because it contained criticism of the French government and its legal system. \n\nAs a result, the French government banned the book in 1885, the year of its publication. So, the correct answer is (A) yes, Alfred Nobel did write a banned book."
