Dandelions are plants, and therefore do not have livers or any other organs like animals do. They also do not have the ability to contract viral infections as they lack the necessary nervous and immune systems to do so. Therefore, it is not possible for a dandelion to suffer from hepatitis. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

Therefore, they are not related in any way, and dandelion does not have a liver or any of the organs that can be affected by hepatitis.\n\nMoreover, hepatitis is caused by viral infections, autoimmune diseases, or exposure to toxins or alcohol. Dandelion is not susceptible to viral infections, and it does not consume alcohol or expose itself to toxins.\n\nIn conclusion, it is highly unlikely for a dandelion to suffer from hepatitis.
