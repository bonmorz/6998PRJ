A breast exam is a physical exam of the breasts and surrounding areas by a healthcare provider to check for any abnormalities, such as lumps or tenderness.\n\nNext, we need to consider the age group we are discussing \u2013 middle schoolers. Middle school typically includes students aged 11-14 years old. At this age, most girls have not yet started developing breasts or have only just begun. Therefore, there is no need for middle schoolers to get breast exams as they typically do not have any breast abnormalities to check for.\n\nAdditionally, it is not standard practice for healthcare providers to conduct breast exams on middle schoolers unless there is a specific medical concern or family history of breast issues. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, people in middle school usually do not get breast exams."

Next, we need to consider the age range for middle school. Middle school typically includes students in grades 6-8 or ages 11-14. Finally, we need to ask whether breast exams are typically recommended for individuals in this age range. The answer to this question is generally no. Breast exams are typically recommended for women over the age of 40, unless they have a family history of breast cancer or other risk factors that would make earlier screening necessary.
