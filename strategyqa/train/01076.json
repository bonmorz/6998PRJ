According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, an average of 140,000 people pass through 30th Street Station every day. \n\nNext, we need to consider the size of Dorton Arena. It has a seating capacity of 7,610 people, which means it can comfortably seat 7,610 people at one time.\n\nNow, we can do some calculations. If we divide the number of people who pass through 30th Street Station each day (140,000) by the seating capacity of Dorton Arena (7,610), we get approximately 18.4. This means that we would need to fill Dorton Arena and empty it 18 times to fit all of the people who pass through 30th Street Station every day.\n\nSince it is not possible to fill and empty an arena 18 times in one day, the answer is no - all of the people who pass through 30th Street Station every day could not fit in Dorton Arena. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

Assuming an even distribution, that would be over 10,000 people per day. \n\nNext, we need to determine the capacity of Dorton Arena. The arena is located in the North Carolina State Fairgrounds and has a seating capacity of 7,610 people. However, we need to consider the standing room floor space as well. According to the North Carolina State Fair website, the building has 150,000 square feet of space. Assuming an average person takes up 4 square feet of space, we can calculate the maximum occupancy to be 37,500 people. \n\nSo, can all the people who pass through 30th Street Station every day fit in Dorton Arena? No, because the maximum capacity of Dorton Arena is only 37,500 people, which is far lower than the 10,000 people who pass through 30th Street Station every day."

That's an average of about 12,000 people per day. \n\nDorton Arena is a multi-purpose indoor arena located in Raleigh, North Carolina. Its seating capacity is approximately 7,610 people. \n\nSo, if we divide the number of daily commuters at 30th Street Station by the seating capacity of Dorton Arena, we get 1.57.

If the capacity of Dorton Arena is greater than or equal to the number of daily ridership at 30th Street Station, then the answer is (A) yes. However, if the capacity of Dorton Arena is less than the number of daily ridership at 30th Street Station, then the answer is (B) no. \n\nIn this case, we can see that the capacity of Dorton Arena is significantly less than the number of daily ridership at 30th Street Station.
