The ADA stands for the Americans with Disabilities Act, which is a federal law that was passed in 1990 to prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities in all areas of public life, including jobs, schools, transportation, and all public and private places that are open to the general public.

Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes, American wheelchair users know what the ADA is."

As per the answer given, the answer is yes, they do know what ADA is.\n\nThe reason behind the affirmative answer is that American wheelchair users are the primary beneficiaries of ADA. The act provides them with accessibility, inclusion, and equality. Therefore, it is safe to assume that they are aware of the existence and importance of the ADA. Moreover, ADA is widely publicized in the media and has been in effect since 1990. It is also a mandatory aspect of building codes and regulations, so it's improbable for American wheelchair users not to know about it.\n\nThus, based on these facts and reasoning, we can confidently assert that American wheelchair users know what ADA is."
