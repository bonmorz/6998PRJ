Secondly, we need to understand what a mental disorder is. A mental disorder is a condition that affects a person's mood, thinking, behavior, and overall well-being. \n\nNow, we can research whether Van Gogh suffered from a mental disorder. According to various sources, including letters he wrote to his brother and medical records, Van Gogh is believed to have suffered from several mental disorders, including bipolar disorder and depression. He also experienced hallucinations and episodes of psychosis. These mental health challenges contributed to his art, as can be seen in some of his more turbulent and vivid paintings, such as \"The Starry Night\" and \"Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, Van Gogh did suffer from a mental disorder."

He is known for his unique, vibrant, and expressive style of painting.\n\nNext, we need to define what a mental disorder is. A mental disorder or illness is a condition that affects a person's thinking, behavior, and mood. It can be caused by various factors, including biological, environmental, and social factors.\n\nNow, we need to examine Van Gogh's life and see if there is evidence of him having a mental disorder. Van Gogh is famously known for his struggles with mental health. Throughout his life, he experienced several episodes of depression, anxiety, and other emotional difficulties. He was also known to exhibit symptoms of bipolar disorder or manic-depressive illness, which causes extreme mood swings from high to low.\n\nAdditionally, Van Gogh's self-portraits often depicted him with a melancholic expression and intense, haunting eyes, which further supports the idea that he was struggling with mental health issues.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence of his life and artistic works, it is safe to say that Van Gogh did suffer from a mental disorder, specifically, bipolar disorder or manic-depressive illness."
