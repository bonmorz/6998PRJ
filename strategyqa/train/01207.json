                "content": "First, we need to understand what a triples tandem bike is. A triples tandem bike is a type of bike designed to accommodate three riders in a single line. \n\nNext, we need to consider the weight of the Apollo 15 crew. The Apollo 15 crew consisted of three astronauts - David R. Scott, James B. Irwin, and Alfred M. Worden. They had a combined weight of approximately 580 pounds (263 kilograms). \n\nNow, we need to determine if a triples tandem bike is capable of supporting this amount of weight. Typically, a triples tandem bike is designed to support a maximum weight of around 600 pounds (272 kilograms). Therefore, it is likely that a triples tandem bike would be able to support the weight of the Apollo 15 crew. \n\nBased on these facts, we can conclude that the answer is (A) yes, a triples tandem bike would support the Apollo 15 crew."

It is a bicycle designed to be ridden by three people, with two people pedaling and one person sitting in the back. \n\nNext, we need to know the weight of the Apollo 15 crew. The Apollo 15 mission consisted of three astronauts - David R. Scott, Alfred M. Worden, and James B. Irwin. According to NASA, their combined weight was approximately 635 pounds (288 kilograms). \n\nNow, we need to determine if a triples tandem bike can support a weight of 635 pounds. This would depend on the specific make and model of the bike, as well as any weight restrictions it may have. \n\nHowever, in general, a triples tandem bike should be able to support the weight of 635 pounds. These types of bikes are designed for multiple riders and can typically support a higher weight limit than a regular bicycle. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, a triples tandem bike would support the Apollo 15 crew."

According to manufacturers, most triples tandem bikes can support a weight capacity of 500-600 pounds, which is more than enough to support the weight of the Apollo 15 crew. \n\nFinally, we need to consider the physical requirements of riding a bike. While riding a bike does require some physical exertion, the crew of Apollo 15 were all well-trained astronauts who were accustomed to rigorous physical activity. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that they would be able to ride a triples tandem bike without issue.\n\nOverall, based on the weight capacity of a triples tandem bike and the physical capabilities of the Apollo 15 crew, it is reasonable to conclude that a triples tandem bike would be able to support the crew. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

Apollo 15 was the fourth manned mission to land on the moon and took place in 1971. The crew consisted of David R. Scott, Alfred M. Worden, and James B.

Since a triples tandem bike is designed to seat three people, it would be able to support the three members of the Apollo 15 crew.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

A tandem bike is a bicycle designed to be ridden by more than one person, typically with two riders seated one behind the other. But a triples tandem bike is designed to be ridden by three riders, with one in the front and two in the back seat, pedaling together.\n\nNow, let's look at the Apollo 15 crew. Apollo 15 was the ninth manned mission in the United States' Apollo program, and it was launched on July 26, 1971, with a crew of three astronauts - David Scott, James Irwin, and Alfred Worden.\n\nBased on the above information, we can conclude that a triples tandem bike would support the Apollo 15 crew. However, it is important to note that a triples tandem bike might not be the most practical or efficient means of transportation for the crew, especially in space!\n\nIn summary, since a triples tandem bike can carry three riders, it would be capable of supporting the Apollo 15 crew, which consisted of three astronauts."

                "content": "Firstly, a triples tandem bike is designed to carry three people, so it has the capacity to support the Apollo 15 crew, which consisted of three astronauts. Therefore, we can eliminate option (B).\n\nSecondly, we need to consider the weight and size of the Apollo 15 crew members. The average weight of an astronaut is around 180 pounds (82 kg), which would be a total weight of 540 pounds (246 kg) for the three Apollo 15 crew members. Most triples tandem bikes have a weight capacity of around 550-600 pounds (250-272 kg), depending on the specific model. Therefore, a triples tandem bike would be able to support the weight of the Apollo 15 crew.\n\nLastly, we need to consider the terrain and conditions in which the bike would be used. The Apollo 15 crew famously drove a lunar rover on the moon, which has a completely different terrain and gravity compared to Earth. However, we can assume that the question is asking about the Earth's surface, where a triples tandem bike could easily support the Apollo 15 crew.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, a triples tandem bike would support the Apollo 15 crew."
