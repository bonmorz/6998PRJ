They analyze the various social, economic and political aspects of different regions that make up the planet. Now, let's think about biochemistry. Biochemistry involves the study of chemical processes that occur within living organisms. This field is mainly concerned with the molecular level of biological systems. Therefore, it is unlikely that a geographer would use biochemistry in their work, as their focus is more on the larger scale of the planet and its inhabitants. Hence, the correct answer is (B) no."
