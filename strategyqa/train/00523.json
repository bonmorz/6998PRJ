The Berlin University of the Arts, also known as the Universit\u00e4t der K\u00fcnste Berlin (UdK), is a modern university that was founded in 1696. It offers courses in visual arts, design, music, and performing arts.\n\nNow, let's focus on the term \"relic.\" A relic typically refers to something that has survived from a previous time period and is regarded as valuable because of its historical or cultural significance. \n\nBased on this information, we can determine that the Berlin University of the Arts cannot be considered a Baroque period relic because it is a modern university that was founded during the Baroque period. While the university's buildings may contain Baroque elements, it is a current institution that serves as an important center for artistic and creative education. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

The Baroque period was a style of artistic expression that dominated Europe from the late 16th century to the mid-18th century.

It was initially located in the Brandenburg Palace, which was built in the Baroque style. Eventually, the academy became the Berlin University of the Arts, and it has since moved to different locations.\n\nSo, based on our research, we can conclude that the Berlin University of the Arts is a Baroque period relic, as it was founded during that period and located in a Baroque-style palace. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes."
