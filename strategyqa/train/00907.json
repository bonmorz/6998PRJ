He is best known for directing disaster films such as San Andreas (2015) and Rampage (2018). \n\nNow, let's focus on the question. The question is asking if Brad Peyton needed to know about seismology. Seismology is the study of earthquakes and the movement of waves through the Earth's crust. \n\nSo, did Brad Peyton need to know about seismology? The answer is yes. This is because Brad Peyton directed San Andreas, a disaster film that revolved around a massive earthquake in California. In order to accurately depict the earthquake and its impact on the surrounding environment, Brad Peyton would have needed to have a good understanding of seismology. This would have included knowledge of the geological makeup of California, fault lines, earthquake magnitudes, and the potential effects of aftershocks. \n\nTherefore, it is safe to say that Brad Peyton needed to have a basic knowledge of seismology in order to create an accurate and realistic portrayal of the earthquake in San Andreas."
