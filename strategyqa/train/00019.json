It is a significant feat in the sport.\n\nNow, we need to ask ourselves if it is named after the ancient Greek poet Homer who wrote the Odyssey. To determine this, we need to look at the history of the term. The use of the term \"Homer\" in baseball dates back to the late 1800s, while the epic poem, the Odyssey, was written by Homer in ancient Greece around 8th century BCE. There is no connection between the two.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) - no, a Homer in baseball is not named after the poet Homer who wrote the Odyssey."

A \"Homer\" is a term used to describe when a player hits the ball over the fence in fair territory, resulting in a home run.\n\nNext, we need to examine the origin of the term \"Homer.\" According to various sources, including the Baseball Almanac and the Oxford English Dictionary, the term \"Homer\" actually originated as slang in the late 19th century, well after the ancient Greek poet Homer wrote the Odyssey. The exact origin of the term is unclear, but it is believed to have originated as a shortened version of \"home run.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, a \"Homer\" is not named after the poet Homer who wrote the Odyssey. The term \"Homer\" is a slang term that originated in baseball to describe a home run, and its origin has nothing to do with the ancient Greek poet."

This claim would suggest that there is a direct connection between the two, but this is not the case. \n\nThe term \"Homer\" in baseball has been used for over a century and is believed to have originated from the name of a player named Ned Williamson, who played for the Chicago White Stockings in the late 1800s. Williamson was known for hitting a large number of home runs and was nicknamed \"Honey\" or \"Homerun\" Ned.
