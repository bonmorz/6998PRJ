She is part of the team behind the popular podcast \"Oh No, Ross and Carrie!\" where they investigate claims of the paranormal and pseudoscience.\n\nGiven her background and reputation for being a skeptic, it is unlikely that Carrie Poppy would trust a psychic. Psychics are often known for making claims that are not backed by scientific evidence and rely more on personal intuition and anecdotal experience. This goes against Carrie Poppy's values of critical thinking and skepticism.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (B) no \u2013 Carrie Poppy would not be likely to trust a psychic."

A psychic is a person who claims to have extrasensory perception or supernatural abilities, such as being able to communicate with the dead, predict the future or sense things beyond normal sensory perception.\n\nNow, based on this information alone, we cannot determine whether Carrie Poppy would trust a psychic. We do not know if she has had any past experiences with psychics or their claims, or if she has any personal beliefs or attitudes towards the supernatural. Therefore, the correct answer would be (C) Insufficient information. However, as this option is not given, we must select the closest option which is (B) no, as there is no evidence or context provided to suggest that she would be likely to trust a psychic."

Carrie Poppy is a journalist and science communicator who has spoken out against the use of psychics and other fraudulent claims. Next, we need to understand what a psychic is. A psychic claims to have an ability to perceive information hidden from normal senses through extrasensory perception (ESP) or to predict the future.\n\nGiven Carrie Poppy's profession and advocacy against fraudulent claims, it is improbable that she would trust a psychic. She advocates for scientific evidence and rationality, and psychics' claims lack empirical evidence and are considered pseudoscience. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no."

Carrie Poppy is a skeptic and investigative journalist who hosts the podcast \"Oh No Ross and Carrie.\" She is known for her critical approach to claims of supernatural and paranormal phenomena.\n\nNow let's consider the second part of the question, whether or not Carrie Poppy would be likely to trust a psychic. As a skeptic and investigative journalist, Carrie Poppy would likely approach claims made by a psychic with a critical eye. She would seek evidence and evaluate the credibility of the psychic's claims before accepting them as true. Therefore, the answer to the question would be (B) no, Carrie Poppy would not be likely to trust a psychic."

To answer this question, we need to consider a few factors that may influence her perspective on psychic abilities. \n\nCarrie Poppy is a journalist and a co-host of the podcast \"Oh No Ross and Carrie,\" where she investigates paranormal claims and pseudoscience. This information suggests that she is skeptical and analytical in her approach to supernatural claims. \n\nPsychics claim to have the ability to communicate with the dead, predict the future or read people's minds. There is no scientific evidence to support these claims, and psychics have been widely debunked by skeptics and scientists. \n\nGiven her background in investigative journalism and her skeptical outlook, it is reasonable to assume that Carrie Poppy would not be likely to trust a psychic. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

She co-hosts a podcast named \"Oh No, Ross and Carrie!\" where they investigate paranormal claims and other pseudoscientific claims. As a sceptic, she tends to not believe in claims that are not backed up by proven evidence. \n\nSo, if we consider the question again, \"Would Carrie Poppy be likely to trust a psychic?\" the answer would be \"no.\" This is because psychics make claims that are not backed up by scientific evidence, and Carrie Poppy is known to be someone who questions and investigates such claims. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that she would trust a psychic."
