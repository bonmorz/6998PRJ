Lorenzo de Medici was a powerful and influential ruler and patron of the arts during the Italian Renaissance. Da Vinci was a renowned artist, inventor, and scientist who lived during the same period.\n\nNext, we need to define what is meant by \"exclusive patronage.\" This term refers to a situation in which one patron financially supports an artist exclusively, meaning that the artist only receives support from that one patron and no one else.\n\nNow, to answer the question, we need to examine the historical record. And according to historical accounts, Lorenzo de Medici was not Da Vinci's exclusive patron. While it's true that Lorenzo was a significant patron of the arts during the Renaissance and provided support to many artists, including Da Vinci, he was by no means the only one.\n\nIn fact, Da Vinci received support from other patrons as well, including Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, and the King of France, Francis I. This demonstrates that Da Vinci's patronage was not exclusive to Lorenzo de Medici.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Lorenzo de Medici's patronage of Da Vinci was not exclusive."

Patronage refers to the support or sponsorship given by a wealthy or influential person to an artist or a writer. \n\nNext, we need to focus on the two names mentioned in the question: Lorenzo de Medici and Da Vinci. Lorenzo de Medici was a powerful and wealthy ruler of Florence in Italy during the Renaissance period, while Da Vinci was a famous artist, inventor, and scientist who lived during the same period.\n\nNow, we need to ask ourselves whether Lorenzo de Medici supported Da Vinci exclusively or not. This means did Lorenzo fund only Da Vinci's works, or did he support other artists as well? \n\nHistorical evidence suggests that Lorenzo de Medici was a patron of many artists during his lifetime, including Michelangelo, Botticelli, and Ghirlandaio, among others. This means that Lorenzo's patronage was not exclusive to Da Vinci, and he supported many other talented artists as well.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to this question is (B) no. Lorenzo de Medici's patronage of Da Vinci was not exclusive, and he supported many other artists during his lifetime."
