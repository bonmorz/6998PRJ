It refers to a person who is ordained in religious life and has taken a vow of celibacy, meaning they have chosen not to engage in sexual activity. \n\nNext, we need to consider the country Somalia. Somalia is a predominantly Muslim country with a conservative culture, but stoning is not a common punishment. Stoning is a punishment that is usually reserved for adultery or other severe crimes, and is not linked to celibacy. Therefore, it is unlikely that a celibate cleric would be stoned in Somalia. \n\nBased on the above explanation, the correct answer is (B) no."

It is a method of execution that is still practiced in some countries, particularly those under Islamic law. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that stoning is usually reserved for crimes such as adultery or fornication, where the accused has engaged in sexual relations outside of marriage. \n\nTherefore, if a cleric in Somalia is celibate, i.e. not engaging in sexual activity, they would not be at risk of being stoned.

Stoning is a form of capital punishment where a group of people throws stones at a person until they die. It is a common form of punishment in countries that follow Islamic law, also known as Sharia law.\nFinally, Somalia is a predominantly Muslim country that follows Islamic law. However, celibacy is not a crime under Islamic law, so a cleric who has taken a vow of celibacy would not be punished by stoning. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

Where is Somalia? Somalia is a country in East Africa, known for its ongoing conflict and instability.\n4. What is stoning? Stoning is a form of capital punishment where a person is pelted with stones until they die.\n5. Based on the above information, we can conclude that a celibate cleric in Somalia is unlikely to be stoned because stoning is not a common punishment for celibacy, and Somalia's legal system is influenced more by Islamic law (Shariah) than Christian religious practices. Additionally, Somalia is currently dealing with more pressing issues such as civil war, famine, and terrorism, which makes it unlikely that they would devote resources to punishing celibacy. Therefore, option (B) no is the correct answer to this question."
