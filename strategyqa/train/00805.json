This means we are looking for band members associated with Charles Manson who have killed more people than him. \n\nSecondly, it is important to understand who Charles Manson was and what his history was. Charles Manson was the notorious leader of a California-based cult called the Manson Family. In 1969, he directed his followers to commit a series of nine murders. However, he personally did not commit any of the murders himself. \n\nThirdly, the question indicates that we are specifically looking for band members associated with Charles Manson. It is known that Manson was a musician and formed a musical group with some of his followers. This group became known as the \"Manson Family\" or the \"Manson Family Band\". \n\nFourthly, it is not widely known that any of the band members associated with Charles Manson killed more people than him. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, there are no known band members associated with Charles Manson who killed more people than him. \n\nIn conclusion, this question tests knowledge of the history of Charles Manson, his association with a musical group, and his involvement in the infamous murders."

Next, we need to understand what is meant by \"killer Manson band members.\" This phrase most likely refers to members of Manson's cult who were involved in the murders he orchestrated. Finally, the question asks whether any of these band members exceeded Manson's kills. This means that we are looking for band members who were involved in more murders than Manson himself. \n\nBased on historical records, there were several members of Manson's cult who were involved in the murders he orchestrated, including Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, and Patricia Krenwinkel. However, none of these individuals were involved in more murders than Manson himself. While Tex Watson did participate in several other murders during the same time period, he did not exceed Manson's total number of kills. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no."

These are individuals who were associated with Charles Manson and were involved in the murders committed by his followers. Next, we need to determine how many people Charles Manson was responsible for killing. Charles Manson was convicted for his role in the murders of Sharon Tate, Abigail Folger, Voytek Frykowski, Jay Sebring, Leno LaBianca, and Rosemary LaBianca. Therefore, Charles Manson is responsible for a total of 7 kills. The question is asking whether any member of his band was responsible for more than 7 kills. It is known that some of his followers, such as Tex Watson and Susan Atkins, were involved in multiple murders. Tex Watson, for example, participated in the murders of 7 people on the night of August 9, 1969. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes, there were members of the Manson Family who were responsible for more than 7 kills."

Charles Manson was an American criminal and cult leader who led what became known as the Manson Family, a group of around 100 followers. In the late 1960s, he directed his followers to commit a series of nine murders at four locations. \n\nNext, we need to understand the question. The question is asking whether any members of the Manson band (presumably a reference to the musicians associated with Charles Manson) were responsible for more killings than Charles Manson himself. \n\nTo answer the question, we need to examine the available evidence. While there is some speculation that members of the Manson Family may have committed additional murders beyond the nine that Manson himself ordered, there is no definitive evidence to support this. Furthermore, there is no known association between Manson and any musical band. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, as there is no evidence to suggest that any members of a Manson band outdid Charles Manson in terms of the number of killings they were responsible for. However, this question is somewhat confusing and may be based on inaccurate or misleading information."

Option B says \"no\", which means that no band members killed more than Manson. \n\nSince we know that Charles Manson was responsible for the deaths of 9 people, we need to investigate whether any band members killed more than 9 people. \n\nInterestingly, there were actually two members of the Manson band who killed more than Manson himself. Tex Watson, who was present at the Tate-LaBianca murders and actively participated in the killings, was responsible for the deaths of 7 people. Susan Atkins, another member of the group who was present at the Tate-LaBianca murders, was also responsible for the deaths of 8 people (including Manson's first victim, Gary Hinman). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is A) yes, there were Manson band members who were named for exceed Charles Manson's kills."
