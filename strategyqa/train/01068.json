The device comes with 32GB of internal storage which can be expanded up to 512GB with a microSD card. This means the total storage capacity of the device can be up to 544GB.\n\nNow, let's assume that each HD episode of Game of Thrones has an average file size of 1GB. This means that a season comprising of 10 episodes will require 10GB of storage space.\n\nWith 544GB of maximum storage capacity, we can theoretically save up to 54 seasons of Game of Thrones on Samsung Galaxy A10e. However, this assumes that the device has no other apps or files stored on it, which is unrealistic.\n\nIn reality, Samsung Galaxy A10e will have other apps and files already stored on it, which will reduce the available storage space. Also, we need to consider the fact that the device's operating system uses a certain amount of the internal storage, which will also reduce the available space.\n\nTherefore, based on the limited storage capacity of Samsung Galaxy A10e, it is not possible to save every HD episode of Game of Thrones on the device. The answer to the question is (B) no."

On average, a single episode of Game of Thrones in HD quality has a file size of around 1.5-2GB. \n\nTherefore, if we assume that all eight seasons of Game of Throne have around 10 episodes each, and we calculate the total file size, it will be around 180GB. This file size is way beyond the storage capacity of the Samsung Galaxy A10e, which is only 32GB.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (B) no, you cannot save every HD episode of Game of Thrones on Samsung Galaxy A10e."

Therefore, even if we consider the smallest size of 500MB per episode, it would require 500MB x 73 (total episodes) = 36.5GB of storage space, which is beyond the device's storage capacity. \n\nSo, it is not possible to save every HD episode of Game of Thrones on Samsung Galaxy A10e. The device simply does not have enough storage. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

The device comes with 32GB of internal storage, of which a portion will already be occupied by the operating system and pre-installed apps. As Game of Thrones HD episodes are quite large, each episode can take up to 2-3GB of storage space. This means, depending on how much space you have left after accounting for the operating system and pre-installed apps, you may only be able to save a limited number of HD episodes of Game of Thrones, and certainly not every episode.\n\nAdditionally, the Samsung Galaxy A10e does not have a microSD card slot, which means you cannot expand the storage beyond the internal 32GB. This further restricts the amount of storage available for saving Game of Thrones episodes.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the answer is (B) no, as it is not possible to save every HD episode of Game of Thrones on the Samsung Galaxy A10e due to its limited storage capacity and lack of expandable storage options."

Each episode of Game of Thrones in HD quality is approximately 2-3GB in size. The total size of all 8 seasons is around 60GB. It is highly unlikely that Samsung Galaxy A10e can store this much data, given its limited storage capacity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, you cannot save every HD episode of Game of Thrones on Samsung Galaxy A10e."

This will depend on the number of episodes, their duration, resolution, and the format in which they are stored. \n\nFor the sake of simplicity, let's assume that we have all the HD episodes (73 episodes in total) of Game of Thrones, each of 60 minutes duration, at a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, and stored in the MP4 format (which is a reasonably compressed format). According to various sources, the average size of such an episode is around 1.5GB. Multiplying this by 73 (the number of episodes) gives us a total size of around 109.5GB. \n\nNow, if we try to save all these episodes on Samsung Galaxy A10e, we would need more than five times the available storage space on the phone.
