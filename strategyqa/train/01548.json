Pharmacology is the study of drugs and their effects on the body.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Julius Caesar was interested in pharmacology or that he read books about it. While it is possible that he may have had some knowledge of medicines and remedies, this was likely due to his personal experiences or his exposure to traditional Roman medicine.

Pharmacology is the branch of medicine that deals with the study of drugs and their effects on the body. \n\nWe cannot definitively prove whether or not Julius Caesar read books on pharmacology, as there is no direct evidence either way in historical records. However, it is highly unlikely that he did. \n\nFirstly, pharmacology as a distinct field of study did not emerge until well after Julius Caesar's lifetime. The modern concept of pharmacology traces its roots to the 19th century, with the rise of synthetic drugs and the scientific study of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. \n\nAdditionally, while Julius Caesar was known for his intelligence and thirst for knowledge, his interests tended towards military strategy, politics, and literature, rather than medicine or science. The Roman civilization of Julius Caesar's time placed more emphasis on the practical applications of medicine, such as surgery, rather than the theoretical study of drugs and their effects. \n\nFor these reasons, we can confidently answer the question with (B) no - Julius Caesar did not read books on pharmacology."
