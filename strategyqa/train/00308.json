Sanskrit is an ancient language of India, which was widely used for religious and philosophical texts.\n\nNext, we need to know the meaning of the word \"swastika\". The swastika is a symbol that has been used in many cultures, including the Hindu and Buddhist traditions. It is commonly associated with good luck and well-being.\n\nSo, when we combine these two pieces of information, we can see that it is likely that the swastika does have meaning in sanskrit. In fact, the word \"swastika\" itself is derived from the sanskrit word \"svastika\", which means \"well-being\" or \"good fortune\".\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, the word swastika does have meaning in sanskrit."

                "content": "First, we need to understand what the word \"swastika\" means. It is a symbol that has been used for thousands of years in various cultures and religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. It consists of a cross with arms bent at right angles, with each arm usually having a continuation at a right angle, either facing clockwise or counterclockwise. The swastika is also known as a \"crux gammata\", as it resembles the Greek letter gamma (\u0393) with hooks on each end.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the word \"swastika\" has meaning in Sanskrit, which is the ancient language of India and the liturgical language of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The answer is yes. In Sanskrit, the word \"swastika\" (\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915) is derived from the prefix \"su\" (meaning \"good\") and \"asti\" (meaning \"to be\"). Thus, \"swastika\" means \"to be good\" or \"favored by fortune\". The symbol itself is considered a representation of auspiciousness and good luck in many cultures.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (A) yes, as the word \"swastika\" has a meaning in Sanskrit."

Sanskrit is an ancient Indo-European language that was spoken in South Asia, particularly in India, before the arrival of Persian and Greek influences. The word \"swastika\" is actually derived from Sanskrit. \n\nNext, we need to determine if the word \"swastika\" has meaning in Sanskrit. To do this, we can break down the word itself. \"Swastika\" is composed of two Sanskrit words: \"su\" which means good, and \"asti\" which means to be. Therefore, \"swasti\" means \"to be good\". \n\nHowever, the word \"swastika\" has been heavily associated with the Nazi party and their use of the symbol during World War II. This has overshadowed its original Sanskrit meaning and has led to many people associating the symbol with hatred and violence. \n\nIn conclusion, while the word \"swastika\" does have meaning in Sanskrit as \"to be good\", its association with the Nazi party has overshadowed its original meaning and has led to a negative connotation in Western society."
