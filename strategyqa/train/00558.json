So, we are comparing the popularity of two works- Hamlet and Comedy of Errors- on this platform.\n\nTo find out which work is more common on IMDB, we can look at their ratings, number of votes, and overall visibility on the website. Additionally, we can also look at the popularity of each work in general to see if that has an impact on its presence on IMDB.\n\nHere's what we know about both works: Hamlet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare while Comedy of Errors is a comedy also written by Shakespeare. However, Hamlet is generally considered to be one of Shakespeare's most popular and celebrated plays. It has been adapted numerous times in different languages, media, and regions. On the other hand, Comedy of Errors is less well-known than Hamlet and is often overshadowed by the popularity of other Shakespearean comedies like A Midsummer Night's Dream and Much Ado About Nothing.\n\nGiven the above information, it is likely that Hamlet is more common on IMDB than Comedy of Errors. Not only is it a more popular work in general, but it has also been adapted into various films, TV series, and theater productions which would increase its visibility on the website.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes- Hamlet is more common on IMDB than Comedy of Errors."

We could interpret this in a few different ways: \n\n- If we're looking at the total number of productions listed for each play, then Hamlet is definitely more common, since it has more adaptations across different mediums. \n- If we're looking at how frequently each play is viewed or searched for on IMDB, that information is harder to find. We could try searching for each play and noting how many views each page has, but this isn't a perfect measure since it might depend on factors like when the page was created, how well-known the production is, etc. \n\nGiven that the question doesn't specify which interpretation of \"more common\" we should use, we'll assume that we're looking at the total number of adaptations listed on IMDB. Based on this interpretation, the answer is (A) yes, since Hamlet has more productions listed than Comedy of Errors."
