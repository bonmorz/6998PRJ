U2 is a famous band known for its hit songs like \"With or Without You\" and \"Beautiful Day.\" Secondly, we need to identify what the Polo Grounds are. The Polo Grounds was a multi-purpose sports stadium in New York City that was demolished in 1964. Now, if we put the two together and assume that U2 played at the Polo Grounds, we would have to accept that either the Polo Grounds was not demolished, or that U2 performed at a different venue with the same name. However, we know that the Polo Grounds was demolished years before U2 even became popular, so it is logically impossible for them to have played a concert there. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, they did not play a concert at the Polo Grounds."
