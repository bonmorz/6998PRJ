According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the highest temperature ever recorded in New York is 108\u00b0F (42\u00b0C), which occurred on July 22, 1926, in Troy. \n\nSecond, we need to understand what a fever is. The normal body temperature range for humans is between 97\u00b0F (36\u00b0C) and 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C). A body temperature of 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) or higher is considered a fever. \n\nThird, we need to consider the consequences of having a fever of 108\u00b0F. A fever of this magnitude is incredibly dangerous and can lead to severe health complications, such as brain damage or organ failure. \n\nTherefore, based on the information we have gathered, we can confidently say that a person would not survive a fever of NY's highest recorded temperature. The answer is (B) no."

A fever this high can cause damage to the body's organs and can lead to seizures, coma, and even death.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"no\", a person would not survive a fever of NY's highest recorded temperature."

According to the National Weather Service, the highest temperature recorded in New York State was 108 \u00b0F (42.2 \u00b0C) on July 22, 1926, in Troy, NY. \n\nSecondly, we need to understand what a fever is and how it affects the body. A fever is a temporary increase in body temperature, often due to an illness or infection. The typical normal body temperature is around 98.6 \u00b0F (37 \u00b0C), and a temperature of 100.4 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) or above is generally considered to be a fever.\n\nNow, let's answer the question. A temperature of 108 \u00b0F is extremely high and dangerous for a person. The body's natural cooling mechanisms, like sweating and dilation of blood vessels, may not be enough to keep the body temperature regulated. Therefore, it is highly unlikely for a person to survive a fever of NY's highest recorded temperature of 108 \u00b0F. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

A quick Google search tells us that the highest recorded temperature in NY was 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42.2 degrees Celsius) in Troy, NY on July 22, 1926. \n\nNext, we need to understand what a fever is and what causes it. A fever is defined as a temporary increase in body temperature, often due to an illness or infection. The average normal body temperature is around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), but can vary slightly from person to person. \n\nNow, let's compare the highest recorded temperature in NY (108 degrees Fahrenheit) to the average normal body temperature (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). It's clear that a fever of 108 degrees Fahrenheit is extremely high, and well beyond the normal range for body temperature. \n\nSo, can a person survive a fever of 108 degrees Fahrenheit? The answer is most likely no. A fever this high can cause damage to the body's organs and put a person's life at risk. Immediate medical attention would be necessary in order to cool the person down and prevent further harm to their body. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, a person would likely not survive a fever of NY's highest recorded temperature."
