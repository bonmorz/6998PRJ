Unfortunately, there is no mention in the Song of Roland or any other historical accounts that Roland was friendly with the Norse or Vikings. Therefore, the answer is (B) no.

The protagonist of this story is Roland, who is a brave and loyal knight serving under Charlemagne, the King of the Franks. \n\nNext, we need to understand what is meant by \"group that had sagas.\" The word saga refers to a long, detailed story or legend, often involving heroic characters or epic battles. In this context, it is likely that the question is referring to a specific group or culture that is known for their sagas. \n\nBased on this information, we can try to answer the question. There is no mention in the Song of Roland that Roland was friendly with any particular group that had sagas. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

The question is asking for a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer and we know that the answer is \"no\". \n\nTo arrive at this answer, we need to consider the context and plot of the \"song of Roland\". The protagonist in this epic poem is Roland, a warrior who is loyal to his king and fights against the invading Saracens. The group that had sagas is likely referring to a group of people who had their own stories and legendary figures. \n\nBased on the plot of the \"song of Roland\", it is unlikely that the protagonist was friendly with this group. Roland's loyalty is primarily to his own side and fellow warriors, while his enemies are clearly the Saracens. The sagas group is not mentioned in the poem and there is no indication that Roland had any relationship or connection with them. Therefore, the answer is \"no\"."

However, there is no evidence in the text of Song of Roland that suggests Roland had any association or friendship with the Vikings. In fact, the poem depicts Roland and the other Franks as battling against the Saracens, who were the enemies of Christianity during the time period in which the poem is set. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Roland was not friendly with the group that had sagas."

Sagas are a type of story, often from Norse or Icelandic literature, that tell about heroic deeds and battles. \nSo, the question is essentially asking if the protagonist in the Song of Roland was friends with a group that told heroic stories and battles. \nThe answer, according to the given choices, is \"no.\" This means that the protagonist was not friends with that particular group.

The protagonist is Roland, who is a noble knight and a trusted member of Charlemagne's army.\n- Next, we need to identify the group that had sagas. This is not specified in the question, so we'll need to do some research or make an educated guess. One possibility is that the group referred to is the Vikings, who were known for their sagas.\n- Now we need to determine whether Roland was friendly with this group. Again, this is not specified in the question, but we can infer that the answer is most likely no. The reason for this is that the Song of Roland is an epic poem that celebrates the victory of Charlemagne's Christian army over the Muslim forces of Spain. The Vikings, on the other hand, were often seen as enemies of Christian Europe, due to their raids and invasions. It is unlikely that Roland, as a member of Charlemagne's army, would have been friendly with the Vikings.\n- Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, Roland was not friendly with the group that had sagas."
