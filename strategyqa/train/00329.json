A quick search reveals that the host country, Canada, received the most gold medals during the 1976 Olympics with a total of 11 gold medals. \n\nNext, we need to determine if Canada still exists as a country. This may seem like a simple answer, but it's important to note that many countries have undergone significant changes, such as name changes, mergers, or splits. \n\nHowever, in the case of Canada, we can confidently say that it still exists as a country. Canada is a stable and well-recognized country that has not undergone any significant changes since its inception in 1867. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, as Canada still exists as a country. \n\nIt's essential to think critically about the details of the question and all the elements involved in answering it. In this case, a basic understanding of the history of the Olympics and world geography was necessary to arrive at the correct answer."

Canada is still a country, so the answer should be \"yes,\" but the answer choices suggest otherwise. Therefore, we need to consider whether the wording of the question is asking about the existence of the country in a different way.\n\nOne possible interpretation is that the question is asking if the country that received the most gold medals in the 1976 Olympics still exists under the same name or political structure. This interpretation would be more challenging to confirm, as it requires knowledge of the political changes and status of countries over time. \n\nHowever, since the wording of the question is straightforward and asks specifically about the country, we can assume that the correct answer is a straightforward \"yes.\" The answer choice \"B\" (no) is incorrect."
