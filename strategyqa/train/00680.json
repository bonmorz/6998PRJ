It can grow and develop \n3. It can respond to stimuli \n4. It can maintain homeostasis \n5. It can metabolize \n\nNow, let's think about Cholera. Cholera is a bacterium that causes severe diarrhea and dehydration. It is a microorganism that belongs to the family of Vibrionaceae.  \n\nCholera may not meet all of the criteria of being \"alive\", but it does reproduce, grow, metabolize and respond to stimuli. Therefore, we can say that Cholera is alive to some extent. Hence, option (A) is correct."

Cholera is a disease caused by a bacteria called Vibrio cholerae. \n\nNow, let's consider the characteristics of living things: they are made of cells, they can grow and reproduce, they can respond to stimuli, and they can obtain and use energy. \n\nBased on these characteristics, we can determine that the bacteria that causes Cholera is indeed alive. Here's why: \n\n- Vibrio cholerae is made of cells, so it meets the first criteria for being alive. \n- This bacteria can also grow and reproduce, which means it is capable of sustaining itself and passing on its genetic information to offspring. This fulfills the second criteria. \n- Additionally, Vibrio cholerae can respond to stimuli. For example, it can sense and move towards nutrients in its environment. This meets the third criteria. \n- Lastly, Vibrio cholerae obtains and uses energy in order to carry out its life processes. For example, it can break down organic matter to release energy. This satisfies the fourth criteria. \n\nIn conclusion, because Vibrio cholerae meets all the criteria for being a living organism, we can confidently answer (A) yes, Cholera is alive."
