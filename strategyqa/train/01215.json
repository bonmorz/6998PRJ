Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy on a tiny scale, such as atoms and subatomic particles.\n\nNow, we can look at whether or not Terry Pratchett wrote about quantum mechanics. While most of his books were comedic fantasy, he did touch on some scientific concepts in his writing. In particular, he wrote a book called \"The Science of Discworld\" which explains scientific concepts through a fictional lens. In this book, he does mention quantum mechanics.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes, Terry Pratchett did write about quantum mechanics, at least in \"The Science of Discworld.\""

Terry Pratchett (1948-2015) was an English author of fantasy novels, comic novels, and humorous books. \n\nSecondly, we need to understand what quantum mechanics is. Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and energy at a very small scale, such as atoms and subatomic particles. \n\nNow, to answer the question, we need to find out if Terry Pratchett's works contain any references to quantum mechanics. It turns out that some of his works do indeed mention quantum mechanics. For example, in his novel \"The Long Earth,\" he explores the concept of multiple universes and the possibilities of quantum mechanics. Additionally, in \"Quantum of Tweed,\" a collection of short stories by various authors, Terry Pratchett contributes a story that deals with the concept of quantum mechanics. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, Terry Pratchett did write about quantum mechanics in some of his works."

He wrote a popular series called Discworld, which consisted of more than 40 books. \n\nNext, we need to understand what quantum mechanics is. Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level. \n\nSo, did Terry Pratchett write about quantum mechanics? The answer is yes. In his book \"The Light Fantastic,\" which is part of the Discworld series, he mentions quantum mechanics. To be specific, one of the characters in the book uses a \"quantum tunneling device\" to travel through space. This device is based on the concept of quantum mechanics. Therefore, (A) yes is the correct answer."

In his book \"The Science of Discworld,\" which was co-authored with scientist Ian Stewart and mathematician Jack Cohen, Pratchett and his co-authors explore various scientific concepts, including quantum mechanics. The book presents these concepts in a humorous and accessible way, which is typical of Pratchett's writing style. So, the answer is (A) yes."
