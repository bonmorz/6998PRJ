The Quran is the holy book of Islam, revealed to the Prophet Muhammad in the seventh century.\n\nFinally, we can answer the question. An adherent of Zoroastrianism would not consult the Quran for religious guidance because the Quran is not part of the Zoroastrian belief system or tradition. Each religion has its own set of holy texts, and Zoroastrianism has its own holy book, the Avesta. Therefore, answer (B) is correct."
