Next, we need to identify who typically uses the yellow pages. In the past, when there were no online directories, people would rely on the yellow pages to find phone numbers and addresses of businesses. However, with the rise of the internet and online directories such as Google Maps and Yelp, the use of the yellow pages has decreased significantly. So, the answer to the question is (A) yes, it would be uncommon for a high schooler to use the yellow pages because they are more likely to use online directories."

The yellow pages are a printed directory of local businesses categorized by business type (i.e. plumbers, electricians, restaurants, etc.). \n\nNext, who typically uses the yellow pages? The yellow pages used to be a popular resource for finding businesses before the internet became widely used. However, with internet searches now being the norm, it is less common for people to use the yellow pages. \n\nNow, let's focus on the question. Would it be uncommon for a high schooler to use the yellow pages? It is safe to assume that most high schoolers are part of the generation that has grown up with the internet and smartphones. Therefore, it is unlikely that a high schooler would choose to use the yellow pages when they have access to faster and more convenient ways of finding information online. \n\nBased on these points, the answer to the question is (A) yes, it would be uncommon for a high schooler to use the yellow pages."

High school students are typically between the ages of 14 and 18 years old. \n\nPutting these two pieces of information together, it is safe to say that it would be uncommon for a high schooler to use the yellow pages. Firstly, high school students are part of the digital generation, and they prefer to search for information online using search engines like Google. Secondly, most high school students would not have a specific need for the yellow pages, as they are more likely to search for information related to school projects or personal interests rather than for business services. \n\nTherefore, option (A) Yes, it would be uncommon for a high schooler to use the yellow pages, is the correct answer."
