She is the author of the beloved Harry Potter series, which features a fantastical world filled with magic, mythical creatures, and supernatural events. Therefore, we can safely assume that her other bestselling books would also contain elements of fantasy. \n\nSecondly, we need to consider what is meant by a \"fantasy shelf.\" A fantasy shelf typically includes books that have fantastical or speculative elements in their plot, setting, or characters. Given that J.K. Rowling's books are known for their inclusion of magic and fantastical creatures, it is likely that her top sellers would be found on a fantasy shelf.\n\nLastly, we need to consider the question's specific wording. The use of \"top sellers\" implies that we are discussing J.K. Rowling's most popular books. Therefore, it is even more likely that her top sellers would be found on a fantasy shelf, as her popularity is largely thanks to her contribution to the fantasy genre.\n\nIn conclusion, J.K.
