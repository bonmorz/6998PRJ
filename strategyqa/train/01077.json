Cuneiform was used as a writing system by multiple civilizations in the ancient Middle East, including the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Assyrians. In contrast, the Greek alphabet was only developed by the Greeks and was not widely adopted by other cultures. \n\nIf we mean which alphabet is more commonly known or recognized today, then the answer would likely be the Greek alphabet. The Greek alphabet is still used in Greece and by many fraternities and sororities in the United States. It is also used in mathematics and science to represent various concepts and variables. Sumerian cuneiform, on the other hand, is not commonly used or recognized today outside of academic circles or archaeology. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, as the Greek alphabet is not as common as Sumerian cuneiform historically."

If we're asking whether the Greek alphabet and Sumerian cuneiform are both used today, then the answer would be \"yes\" for both, since both scripts still exist in some form or another. However, if we're asking which script is more widely known or recognized, then the answer is likely (B) no \u2013 that is, the Greek alphabet is more widely known than Sumerian cuneiform.\n\nTo understand why, we need to consider a few factors. First of all, the Greek alphabet is the basis for many modern writing systems, including the Latin alphabet (used in English and many other languages), the Cyrillic alphabet (used in Russian and other Slavic languages), and the Hebrew alphabet (used in Hebrew and Yiddish). As a result, many people around the world are at least somewhat familiar with the Greek alphabet, even if they don't speak modern Greek.\n\nOn the other hand, Sumerian cuneiform is a much more obscure script that is no longer used in any living languages. While it is true that cuneiform was one of the earliest forms of writing in human history, it hasn't been in widespread use for thousands of years. As a result, far fewer people are likely to be familiar with cuneiform than with the Greek alphabet.\n\nSo while both scripts technically exist today, the Greek alphabet is certainly more \"common\" than Sumerian cuneiform in terms of how widely recognized and used it is around the world."

It is still used today in Greece, Cyprus, and other places that use the Greek language. On the other hand, Sumerian cuneiform is one of the earliest known writing systems that was used in ancient Mesopotamia to write the Sumerian language.\n\nNow, the question is asking whether the Greek alphabet is as common as Sumerian cuneiform. To answer this question, we need to consider the historical contexts and the current usage of both writing systems.\n\nGreek alphabet was first introduced in the 8th century BC and has been used continuously since then. It spread throughout the Mediterranean region and influenced many other writing systems, such as the Latin alphabet (which is used for English, Spanish, French, Italian, and many other languages). Today, Greek alphabet is used primarily for writing the Greek language, and it is still a widely used writing system in Greece, Cyprus, and other places where Greek is spoken.\n\nOn the other hand, Sumerian cuneiform was used in ancient Mesopotamia around 3500 BC. It was a complex writing system that required thousands of different signs to represent different words and concepts. While it was widely used in the ancient Near East, it was gradually replaced by other writing systems such as Akkadian cuneiform and Aramaic script. As a result, Sumerian cuneiform fell out of use and became a dead language by the 1st century AD.\n\nBased on these facts, we can conclude that the Greek alphabet is more common than Sumerian cuneiform. Greek alphabet is still actively used today, while Sumerian cuneiform has been a dead language for more than a thousand years. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no."

However, if we are asking which was more widely used historically, the answer would likely be Sumerian cuneiform, as it was used by a civilization that existed thousands of years before the Greek alphabet was developed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, because while the Greek alphabet may be more commonly used today, historically, Sumerian cuneiform was a more widely used writing system."

Sumerian cuneiform, on the other hand, is a writing system that uses wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets and can be traced back to around 3200 BC.\n\nNow, we can answer the question. The answer is (B) no. This is because Sumerian cuneiform was used for a longer period of time and was used by a larger number of people than the Greek alphabet. While the Greek alphabet is still used today in modern Greek, it is not as widely used as Sumerian cuneiform was during its time. Therefore, the Greek alphabet is not as common as Sumerian cuneiform."

It was an essential system for Sumerian writing, religion, and administration, but it ceased to be used several centuries ago.\n\nTherefore, given that the Greek alphabet is still in use today and has influenced other writing systems, while Sumerian cuneiform has not been used for thousands of years, the answer to the question is (B) no, the Greek alphabet is not as common as Sumerian cuneiform."
