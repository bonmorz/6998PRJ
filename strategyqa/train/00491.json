Martin Luther was a German monk who lived in the 16th century and is known for initiating the Protestant Reformation. Martin Luther King Jr., on the other hand, was a Baptist minister and civil rights activist who lived in the 20th century.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that they were not of the same sect because Martin Luther was a member of the Catholic Church before he broke away, while Martin Luther King Jr. was a Baptist. So, the correct answer is (B) no."

He fought for racial equality and social justice primarily through nonviolent activism and civil disobedience.\n\nFrom the above explanation, we can see that Martin Luther and Martin Luther King Jr. were not of the same sect. Martin Luther was a religious figure who played a significant role in the Protestant Reformation, while Martin Luther King Jr. was an activist who fought for civil rights and social justice in America. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no."
