The largest ship he used was the Santa Maria, which was around 62 feet long and 18 feet wide. \n\nNext, we need to find out the size of the Statue of Liberty. The statue itself stands at 151 feet tall and is made of copper sheets that are only 2.4 mm thick, while the pedestal it stands on is about 89 feet tall. \n\nSo, could the largest ship from the voyages of Columbus haul the statue of liberty? No, because the Statue of Liberty is much too large and heavy to be carried by a ship that small. The statue alone weighs over 225 tons and would require a much larger vessel capable of carrying that weight. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

According to historical records, his largest ship was the Santa Maria, which had a length of about 116 feet (35 meters) and a width of about 30 feet (9 meters).\n\nNext, we need to know the size of the Statue of Liberty, which is located in New York City. The statue stands at a height of about 305 feet (93 meters) from the ground to the tip of the torch. It weighs around 225 tons (204 metric tons) and is made of copper sheets that are only 3/32 of an inch (about 2 mm) thick.\n\nBased on these measurements, it is clear that the largest ship from Voyages of Christopher Columbus would not be able to haul the Statue of Liberty. The ship's length and width are much smaller than the height of the statue, which means that the statue would not fit on the deck of the ship.\n\nAdditionally, the weight of the statue is much greater than the capacity of the largest ship used by Christopher Columbus. It is unlikely that the ship's structure would be able to handle the weight, and the ship would likely capsize or sink under the weight of the statue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the largest ship from Voyages of Christopher Columbus could not haul the Statue of Liberty."

It is clear that the weight of the statue would far exceed the weight capacity of the Santa Maria, as the ship was designed to carry cargo weighing no more than a few hundred tons. Furthermore, the statue's height and width far exceed the dimensions of the Santa Maria. \n\nTherefore, we can confidently conclude that the largest ship from the Voyages of Christopher Columbus could not haul the Statue of Liberty.
