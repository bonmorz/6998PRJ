According to folklore, if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and sees its shadow, it will retreat back underground, indicating six more weeks of winter. If it doesn't see its shadow, spring will arrive early.\nNext, we need to consider the climate in New York during February. February is typically the coldest month in New York with average temperatures ranging from the mid-20s to the mid-30s Fahrenheit. It can be very cold, particularly in the morning and evening.\nGiven this information, it is likely that most school children in New York would be wearing jackets on Groundhog Day.
