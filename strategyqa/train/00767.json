Then we need to analyze when Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was published, which was in 1997. These two points clearly indicate that Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was not published during the great depression. Therefore, it is safe to say that it was not popular during that time. Hence, the correct answer is (B) no."

The first book in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in the United Kingdom in June 1997, and in the United States in September 1998.\n\nBased on these timelines, we can determine that Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was not popular during the Great Depression. It was published many years after the Great Depression had ended, and therefore could not have been popular during that time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
