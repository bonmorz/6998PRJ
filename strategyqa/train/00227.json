The Tudors were the English royal family during the 15th and 16th centuries. Specifically, we need to look for a connection to King Henry VII or King Henry VIII, who were ruling during this time period. \n\nIt is known that King Manuel I had a sister named Leonor who married King Jo\u00e3o II of Portugal. King Jo\u00e3o II also had a daughter named Isabella who married King Manuel I. \n\nNow, we need to determine if any of these individuals had familial ties to the Tudors. King Henry VII had a daughter named Margaret Tudor who married King James IV of Scotland. The couple had a son named James V who later married Mary of Guise. Mary of Guise had a sister named Louise of Guise who married King Francisco I of France. King Francisco I of France was cousins with King Manuel I of Portugal. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that King of Portuguese people in 1515 did have familial ties to the Tudors, as his cousin King Francisco I of France was connected to the Tudors through marriage. The answer is (A) yes."

One famous Tudor monarch was Henry VIII. \n\nTo answer the question, we need to look for any historical evidence that suggests familial ties between King Manuel I of Portugal and the Tudors. It is known that King Manuel I of Portugal had a sister named Isabella. Isabella was married to King Charles V of Spain, who was the nephew of Catherine of Aragon. Catherine of Aragon was the first wife of Henry VIII.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that King Manuel I of Portugal did have familial ties to the Tudors through his sister's marriage to King Charles V of Spain, who was related to Henry VIII's first wife.

Then, we need to examine whether Manuel I had familial ties to the Tudors. To answer this question, we need to look at the family history of both the Portuguese royal family and the Tudor dynasty. \n\nManuel I had several siblings and children, but there is no record of any direct familial ties with the Tudors. However, his daughter, Princess Isabella, was married to Charles V of Spain, who was the grandson of Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon. Isabella of Castile was the sister of Catherine of Aragon, who was the first wife of King Henry VIII of England. Therefore, through the marriage of Princess Isabella to Charles V, Manuel I indirectly had familial ties to the Tudors. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, King of Portuguese people in 1515 had familial ties to the Tudors but indirectly through his daughter's marriage to Charles V of Spain, who was related to the Tudors."
