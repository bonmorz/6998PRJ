                "content": "1. What is smog? Smog is a type of air pollution made up of a mixture of harmful pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter.\n2. What causes smog? Smog is mostly caused by human activities, such as industrial and vehicular emissions, but can also be influenced by natural factors like weather conditions.\n3. How is air quality measured? Air quality can be measured using the Air Quality Index (AQI), which reports the amount of pollutants in the air and their potential health effects. AQI values range from 0-500, with higher values indicating poorer air quality.\n4. What is considered a smoggy day? In general, an AQI value of 101 or higher is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups, and an AQI value of 151 or higher is considered unhealthy for everyone. Therefore, a day with an AQI value above 100 can be considered a smoggy day.\n5. What is the air quality like in D\u00fcsseldorf? According to the European Environment Agency, the average annual concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5) in D\u00fcsseldorf was 13 micrograms per cubic meter in 2019, which is below the EU annual limit of 25 micrograms per cubic meter. This suggests that D\u00fcsseldorf has generally good air quality.\n6. How many smoggy days does D\u00fcsseldorf have each year? Although specific data on the number of smoggy days in D\u00fcsseldorf is not readily available, the fact that the city has good air quality overall suggests that it likely has only a small number of smoggy days each year.\n7. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes."

Smog is a type of air pollution that occurs when pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds react with sunlight to form harmful ozone. Smog can cause respiratory problems such as asthma, and is commonly associated with urban areas and high levels of automobile traffic.\n\nNext, we need to understand what is meant by \"a small number of smoggy days.\" Generally, this refers to the number of days in a year where air quality is considered poor due to high levels of smog. A small number might be less than 10 or 20 days per year.\n\nBased on this understanding, we can turn to the question at hand. The question asks whether D\u00fcsseldorf has only a small number of smoggy days each year. To answer this, we need to look at data on air quality in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\nAccording to a report published by the European Environment Agency in 2020, D\u00fcsseldorf had an average of 16 days per year where air quality exceeded EU recommended limits for PM10, a type of fine particulate matter that can be harmful to human health. This suggests that D\u00fcsseldorf does have a small number of smoggy days each year, as defined by the criteria we discussed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes."
