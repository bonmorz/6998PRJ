The atmospheric pressure on Venus is about 90 times that of Earth, which is equivalent to being submerged under 1 kilometer of water. The thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide traps the energy from the Sun, creating an intense greenhouse effect that keeps the surface of Venus hot enough to melt lead.\n\nBased on these facts, we can conclude that someone on Venus would be highly unlikely to experience hypothermia since the planet's high surface temperature would prevent their body from losing heat, making it virtually impossible for their body temperature to drop to dangerously low levels. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, someone on Venus would be unlikely to experience hypothermia."
