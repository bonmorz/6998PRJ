So, our focus is on the speed at which the two books can be read.\n\nSecondly, we need to consider the length of the two books. The Raven is a poem and is much shorter than The Great Gatsby, which is a novel.\n\nThirdly, we need to consider the difficulty level of the two books. The Great Gatsby is written in a more complex style and has a deeper meaning than The Raven, which is a horror poem.\n\nBased on these factors, it is likely that the speed reader will read The Raven faster than The Great Gatsby. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

Now, the question asks whether Speed reader will finish reading The Great Gatsby before the Raven. To answer this, we need to know the lengths of both books. \n\nThe Great Gatsby, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, has a total of 180 pages. On the other hand, The Raven, a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, has only 108 lines. Since The Great Gatsby is a novel, it has significantly more words than The Raven. \n\nTherefore, it's unlikely that Speed reader will finish reading The Great Gatsby before The Raven, as it simply has more content to read through.

A speed reader is someone who can read faster than the average person, but they still have a limit to how fast they can read. Let's say that the speed reader can read at a rate of 500 words per minute.\n\nNow, we need to compare the word count of The Great Gatsby and the Raven. The Great Gatsby has a word count of approximately 50,000 words, while the Raven has a word count of approximately 1,000 words. \n\nIf the speed reader reads at a rate of 500 words per minute, it would take them about 100 minutes to read The Great Gatsby (50,000/500=100). On the other hand, it would only take them about 2 minutes to read the Raven (1,000/500=2).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the speed reader will finish reading the Raven before they finish reading The Great Gatsby.
