According to the FDA, the safe temperature range for cold food storage is between 40\u00b0F and 32\u00b0F (or 4\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C). Now we need to find out the water temperature range where manta rays live. Manta rays are found in tropical and subtropical waters worldwide. These waters typically have a temperature range of 70\u00b0F to 84\u00b0F (or 21\u00b0C to 29\u00b0C). As you can see, the temperature range where manta rays live is much higher than the safe temperature range for cold food storage. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, manta rays live in water above the safe temperature for cold food storage."

The United States Food and Drug Administration recommends that cold foods be stored at a temperature range of 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) or below to prevent bacterial growth and food spoilage. Next, we need to determine the water temperature range where manta rays live. Manta rays are found in tropical and subtropical waters, with temperatures ranging from around 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C) to 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C).
