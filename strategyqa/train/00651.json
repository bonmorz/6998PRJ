It is geographically located in the far northwest of North America, separated from the rest of the country by Canada. \n\nKnowing these facts, we can determine that it is highly unlikely for Alaska to have been a part of the Northern Army during the Civil War. The Northern Army primarily operated in the eastern and northern states of the country, fighting against the Confederacy. \n\nFurthermore, Alaska's population at the time was very small and mainly made up of indigenous peoples, with few settlers. This would have made it difficult for them to participate in the war effort even if they had wanted to. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Alaska was not part of the Northern Army during the Civil War."

It wasn't until 1867 that the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in what is known as the Alaska Purchase.\n\nTherefore, it would not make sense for Alaska to be a part of the Northern Army during the Civil War, since it was not a part of the United States at the time. The correct answer is (B) no."

Alaska, however, did not become a state until 1959, long after the Civil War had ended. So, Alaska could not have been a state during the Civil War. \n\nNext, we need to consider whether Alaska was part of the United States during the Civil War. Alaska was not yet a part of the United States during the Civil War, as it was still controlled by the Russian Empire until 1867 when it was sold to the United States in the Alaska Purchase. \n\nFinally, we need to determine whether Alaska was part of the Northern Army, which fought for the Union during the Civil War, or the Southern Army, which fought for the Confederacy. As Alaska was not a part of the United States during the Civil War, it could not have represented either the North or the South. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, Alaska was not part of the Northern Army during the Civil War."

Alaska was not yet a state during the Civil War. It was only in 1867, two years after the end of the Civil War, that the United States purchased Alaska from Russia and officially added it to their territories.\n\nFinally, we need to know whether Alaska played any role in the Civil War. There is no record of Alaska providing troops or resources to either the Union or Confederate armies during the Civil War. \n\nTherefore, based on these facts, the answer is (B) no, Alaska was not part of the Northern Army (or any army) during the Civil War."

It was still a Russian colony until its purchase by the United States in 1867.

By breaking down the question into smaller pieces, we can logically eliminate the incorrect answer and arrive at the correct answer."
