It refers to the overthrow of King James II in 1688 by a group of English parliamentarians and William of Orange, who became the new king. \n\nNext, we should define what mercenaries are. They are soldiers who fight in wars for money, rather than out of loyalty to a particular country or cause. \n\nWith these definitions in mind, we can examine why the answer to the question is no. While there were certainly soldiers who fought for William of Orange in the Glorious Revolution, they were not considered mercenaries. This is because they were not fighting solely for pay, but rather for a political cause - specifically, to depose King James II and establish William as the new king. \n\nTherefore, while soldiers did fight for William in the Glorious Revolution, they were not mercenaries. As such, the answer to the question is (B) no."

The Glorious Revolution was a political coup in England in 1688, where the Catholic James II was replaced by the Protestant William of Orange and Mary. Were mercenaries involved in the Glorious Revolution? Mercenaries are soldiers who fight for payment, usually from a foreign country. So, did England hire mercenaries to fight for them during the Glorious Revolution? In general, the Glorious Revolution was a domestic political conflict rather than a military one, and there is no evidence that England hired mercenaries to fight for them during the event. Therefore, the answer is (B) no - mercenaries did not fight for England in the Glorious Revolution."

So, did England hire foreign soldiers to fight for them during the Glorious Revolution? While there were armies from foreign countries involved in the revolution, they were not mercenaries, but rather professional soldiers from the Netherlands who were hired by William of Orange, who became King William III of England after the revolution.

The Glorious Revolution was the overthrow of King James II of England by a group of Protestant English nobles in 1688-1689.

A mercenary is a professional soldier who is hired to fight for a foreign army or a group other than their own.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that mercenaries did not fight for England in the Glorious Revolution. This is because the overthrow of King James II was led by English nobles who were fighting for their own cause, not for a foreign power or a group they were hired by.

The Glorious Revolution was largely fought by the English army and rebels within England.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

Mercenaries are soldiers who are hired by a foreign country to fight in a war or conflict. They are motivated by financial gain rather than loyalty to a particular country.\n\nNow, we can answer the question. As the Glorious Revolution was a conflict between two factions within England, there was no need for England to hire mercenaries. Additionally, hiring mercenaries would have been costly and potentially risky, as they may not have had the same loyalty and commitment to the cause as English soldiers. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, mercenaries did not fight for England in the Glorious Revolution."
