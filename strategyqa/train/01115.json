According to Google, the album \"Boy\" has a total duration of 42 minutes and 14 seconds. \n\nNext, we need to know how long an episode of Peppa Pig lasts. According to the official Peppa Pig website, each episode is approximately 5 minutes long. \n\nNow, we can calculate the total duration of Peppa Pig episodes. If we assume we want to listen to a full season of Peppa Pig, which typically contains 52 episodes, the total duration of Peppa Pig episodes would be 52 x 5 = 260 minutes or 4 hours and 20 minutes. \n\nCompare this duration to the duration of the U2 debut studio album, which is only 42 minutes and 14 seconds. Clearly, the entire U2 album can't be listened to during an episode of Peppa Pig, so the correct answer is (B) no."

Most episodes of Peppa Pig are approximately 5 minutes long, although some may be longer or shorter. \n\nSo, to calculate the total duration of Peppa Pig, we need to know how many episodes will play during the time it takes to listen to the entire U2 debut studio album. \n\nDividing 42 minutes and 28 seconds (the duration of \"Boy\") by 5 minutes (the length of a Peppa Pig episode) gives us 8.45. However, we can't play a partial episode, so we need to round down to 8. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that it is not possible to listen to the entire U2 debut studio album during an episode of Peppa Pig as it would take more than 8 episodes to play. The answer is (B) no."
