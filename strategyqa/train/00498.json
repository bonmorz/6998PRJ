This height makes him one of the tallest professional wrestlers in history.\nConsidering that a Yeti, if it exists, is believed to have a height of around 6-7 feet (182.9-213.4 cm), it is safe to say that it would be towered over by Andre the Giant who stood at 7'4\".\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, a hypothetical Yeti would be towered over by Andre the Giant."

A Yeti is a mythical creature that is said to be similar to a large, ape-like creature that is said to live in the Himalayan region.\n\nNow, we can infer that Andre the Giant would be taller than a Yeti. This is because the average height of a male Yeti is said to be around 6 feet tall, based on eyewitness accounts and reported sightings. In contrast, Andre the Giant was over 7 feet tall, which means that he would tower over a Yeti if they were real.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes - a hypothetical Yeti would be towered over by Andre the Giant."

Yetis are mythical creatures that have been described as being between 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) tall, but their existence has never been proven. \n\nSince the tallest recorded height of a Yeti is still shorter than Andre the Giant's height, we can conclude that if a Yeti were to exist, it would indeed be towered over by Andre the Giant.
