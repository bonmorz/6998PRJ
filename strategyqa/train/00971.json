It is asking whether Eddie Murphy's father saw his (Eddie's) first stand up show. We don't have any information to suggest that he did, so we can confidently choose answer (B) - no. \n\nIt's worth noting that Eddie Murphy has spoken publicly about his relationship with his father, and has mentioned that they did watch comedy together when he was growing up. However, this question specifically asks about Eddie's first stand up show, which is a separate event."

Therefore, we need to consider the information we know about Eddie Murphy and his father to determine the answer.\n\nFirstly, if Eddie Murphy's father did see his first stand-up show, it would be stated in the question as a positive answer. However, the answer given is \"no,\" which means that Eddie Murphy's father did not see his first stand-up show.\n\nFurthermore, we can look up some information about Eddie Murphy's early life and his relationship with his father to confirm this answer. Reports state that Eddie's father, Charles Murphy, was not supportive of his son's comedy career and often criticized his performances. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that he would have attended Eddie's first stand-up show.\n\nIn summary, based on the information provided and additional research, the correct answer is (B) no, Eddie Murphy's father did not see his first stand-up show."

To answer this question, we need to know whether Eddie Murphy's father was there when he performed his first stand-up show. \n\nThere are a couple of possibilities. If Eddie Murphy's father was not present at the first show, then the answer would be no. If Eddie Murphy's father was present, then the answer would be yes. \n\nHowever, the answer to this specific question is (B) no, because it is well known that Eddie Murphy's father died when Eddie was young and before he became a famous comedian.

In order to answer this question, we need some background information. Eddie Murphy started his career in comedy by performing stand up comedy in various clubs in New York City. His first highly successful stand up show was \"Delirious\" in 1983, which was later released as a film. \n\nNow, knowing that Eddie Murphy's father was alive at the time of his first stand up show, we still cannot conclude whether he saw it or not. There is no publicly available information that confirms or denies whether Eddie Murphy's father saw his first stand up show. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

He began his career as a stand-up comedian in the late 1970s, and shortly thereafter began appearing in movies.\n\nNow, the question is whether Eddie Murphy's father saw his first stand-up show. We don't have any information about this in the question stem, so we need to use our knowledge of Eddie Murphy to make an educated guess.\n\nBased on what we know about Eddie Murphy's father, it's possible that he did not see his first stand-up show. Eddie's father, Charles Edward Murphy, died when Eddie was only eight years old, so it's unlikely that he would have been able to attend any of Eddie's early performances. Additionally, Eddie's early performances were primarily at small venues in New York City, which would not have been as accessible to someone living in New Jersey, where Eddie grew up with his family.\n\nGiven these factors, we can reasonably assume that the correct answer is (B) no."
