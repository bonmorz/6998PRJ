However, we can assume that he must have experienced some form of technology or communication during his childhood. Nevertheless, it is highly unlikely that he enjoyed something that did not exist during his lifetime. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, P. G. Wodehouse did not like the internet as a child because it was not available during that era."

However, we need to keep in mind that the internet did not exist during his childhood (Wodehouse lived from 1881-1975, and the first operational internet network was not established until 1969). Therefore, it is impossible for him to have had any opinions on the internet as a child. \n\nSo, looking at the options, we can eliminate option A as it suggests that Wodehouse had a positive or favorable opinion towards the internet during his childhood, which is impossible timeline-wise. This leaves us with option B, which suggests that P. G. Wodehouse did not like the internet as a child - this is the correct answer as it is the only plausible option out of the two given."

He was born in 1881 and grew up in the late 19th century and early 20th century, a time when the internet did not exist. \n\nBased on these facts, it is safe to assume that P. G.

G. Wodehouse's childhood. Since he was born in 1881 and passed away in 1975, we can safely assume that the internet did not exist during his childhood. The first iteration of the internet, known as ARPANET, was created in the 1960s. \n\nSo, even if we don't know anything else about P. G. Wodehouse's childhood or personal preferences, we can confidently answer this question with (B) no, since the internet did not exist during his childhood for him to form an opinion on."
