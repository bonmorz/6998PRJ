Jacques Du\u00e8ze lived in the 14th century, while Richard Dawkins is a contemporary figure.\n\nGiven the vast differences in time period, it's unlikely that the two would have been able to meet and form a friendship.

Secondly, Jacques Du\u00e8ze was a theologian who believed in the existence of God and the importance of religion, while Richard Dawkins is famously known for his atheistic beliefs and criticism of religion. As a result, it is unlikely that Du\u00e8ze and Dawkins would have been friends given their starkly differing views on religion and God. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
