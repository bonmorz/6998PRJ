We also know that she was known for her iconic fashion sense and often wore high-end designer clothing. \n\nNow, the question specifically asks whether she wore Dolce & Gabbana to her husband's inauguration. However, Dolce & Gabbana did not exist as a fashion brand until 1985, many years after Kennedy's time as First Lady. Therefore, it is impossible for her to have worn Dolce & Gabbana to the inauguration. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no. She did not wear Dolce & Gabbana to her husband's inauguration."
