Alliteration is the repetition of sound at the beginning of nearby words. \nNow, we can analyze the names of The Powerpuff Girls. We can see that each name starts with a different letter, but each name also contains repeated sounds at the beginning of the words. Blossom starts with the \"B\" sound, Bubbles starts with the \"B\" sound as well, and Buttercup starts with the \"B\" sound. Therefore, the names of The Powerpuff Girls are alliterative. The correct answer is (A)."
