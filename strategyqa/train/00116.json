                "content": "Firstly, what are abyssal plains? Abyssal plains are vast, flat, and relatively featureless regions of the ocean floor that lie at abyssal depths, typically around 3,000 to 6,000 meters (9,800 to 19,700 ft) below the surface of the ocean. \n\nNext, what are goats? They are a domesticated mammal, that belongs to the family Bovidae and genus Capra.\n\nSo now we can come to the answer. As goats are a domesticated mammal, typically found on land and in farm settings, it is highly unlikely that they would be found on abyssal plains which are found in the deep ocean. Therefore the correct answer is (B) no."

Goats are terrestrial animals, meaning they live primarily on land and are not adapted for life in water. Therefore, it is unlikely that goats would be found on abyssal plains.
