New England is a region in the northeastern part of the United States while Sainsbury's is a supermarket chain based in the United Kingdom. \n\nNow, let's focus on the question. The question asks if we could drive from New England to a Sainsbury's. Since Sainsbury's is located in the UK, we cannot drive from New England to a Sainsbury's directly. \n\nTo drive from New England to the UK, one would need to cross the Atlantic Ocean, which is not possible by car. Alternatively, taking a car ferry or shipping the car could be an option. However, this is not what the question explicitly asks. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) No, as it is not possible to drive from New England to a Sainsbury's directly."
