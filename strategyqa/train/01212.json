Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."

If we assume an average weight of 150 pounds per student (which may be conservative), the total weight of the student body would be around 894,600 pounds or 447.3 tons.\n\nNext, we need to know the towing capacity of a Ford F-350. According to Ford's website, the maximum conventional towing capacity for a Ford F-350 is 21,000 lbs. Even if we assume that we could tow several times the conventional towing capacity using a fifth-wheel hitch, the weight of the student body still exceeds this limit by more than 400 tons.

Assuming an average weight of 150 pounds per student (including clothes and belongings), that would be a total weight of 900,000 pounds or 450 tons. \n\nNext, we need to consider the towing capacity of a Ford F-350. According to Ford's website, the 2021 F-350 has a maximum towing capacity of 37,000 pounds when properly equipped with a diesel engine and other towing features. \n\nTherefore, even if we assume that we could somehow fit all 6,000 students onto a trailer and that the trailer itself weighed nothing, the F-350's towing capacity would still fall far short of the weight of the entire student body. \n\nBased on these calculations, the answer is (B) no, a Ford F-350 cannot tow the entire Yale University student body."

As of Fall 2019, Yale University had a total enrollment of approximately 13,000 students. \n\nNext, we need to find out the weight of an average Yale student. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the average weight for American college students is 156 pounds (70.76 kg). \n\nSo, if we multiply the weight of one student (70.76 kg) by the total number of Yale students (13,000), we get 919,880 kg or 919.88 metric tons. \n\nNow, let's look at the towing capacity of a Ford F-350. According to Ford's website, the maximum towing capacity of a Ford F-350 is 35,750 pounds (16,204 kg). \n\nGiven that the weight of an entire Yale student body is significantly higher than the towing capacity of a Ford F-350, the answer is (B) no, a Ford F-350 cannot tow the entire Yale University student body."

According to the 2021 Ford F-350 specifications, the maximum conventional towing capacity for the F-350 is 21,200 pounds.\n\nTherefore, we can see that the maximum towing capacity of the Ford F-350 is not even close to the weight of the entire Yale University student body. The weight of the student body is almost 100 times the maximum towing capacity of the F-350. Hence, the answer to the question is (B) no, Ford F-350 cannot tow the entire Yale University student body."
