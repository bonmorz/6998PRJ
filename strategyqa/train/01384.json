When they sting, the stinger lodges into the skin of the victim and remains there, tearing away from the bee's body and causing the bee to die. \n\nNow, let's consider the question. Can a honey bee sting a human more than once? Based on the anatomy of a honey bee, the answer is no. Once the honey bee stings the victim, the stinger remains in the skin and the bee dies. Therefore, it is physically impossible for a honey bee to sting a human more than once. \n\nSome other species of bees, such as bumblebees and sweat bees, have smooth stingers that can be withdrawn from the skin after a sting. This allows them to sting multiple times. However, the question specifically asks about honey bees, and the answer for honey bees is no \u2013 they cannot sting a human more than once."

This causes the bee's abdomen to rip away from its body, ultimately leading to its death. \n\nTherefore, technically speaking, a honey bee cannot sting a human more than once because it will only sting once and then die. Other types of bees, such as bumblebees or wasps, may be able to sting multiple times because they have smooth stingers that don't get stuck in the skin. However, the question specifically asks about honey bees, and the answer is that they cannot sting a human more than once."

When a honey bee stings a human or other animal, the barbs on the stinger become embedded in the skin, causing the stinger to be pulled from the bee's body. This results in the bee's death, as it cannot survive without its stinger and other critical body parts that also get left behind.\n\nSo, while the bee may attempt to sting a human multiple times, it is physically impossible for it to do so because it ultimately loses its stinger and dies after the first sting. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no - a honey bee cannot sting a human more than once."
