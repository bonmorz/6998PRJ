She suffered severe injuries to her face and lost both her hands as a result of the attack. Now, let's answer the question. Given what we know about Charla Nash, it is expected that she would be anxious near a gorilla (Answer A) or any kind of primate for that matter. This is because Charla Nash experienced a traumatic event with a primate that has caused physical and emotional scars. It would be reasonable to expect her to be fearful and anxious around primates after suffering such an attack. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

Charla Nash was a victim of a vicious primate attack in 2009, during which a friend's pet chimpanzee named Travis mauled her, resulting in the loss of her eyes, nose, lips, and hands. \n\nNow, we need to consider the question - would it be expected for Charla Nash to be anxious near a gorilla? We know that Charla Nash's attack was caused by a chimpanzee, not a gorilla. However, both chimpanzees and gorillas are primates and can exhibit similar behaviors. Additionally, it is not uncommon for victims of animal attacks to develop a fear or anxiety towards similar animals.\n\nTherefore, it is expected that Charla Nash would be anxious near a gorilla due to her traumatic experience with a primate attack. Answer (A) is correct."

Next, we need to consider what type of animal a gorilla is. A gorilla is a large primate species that generally lives in the wild. They are known for their strength and powerful presence. Now, we need to consider any potential reasons why Charla Nash might feel anxious around a gorilla. One possibility is that she may have had a negative experience with a gorilla in the past or has a fear of animals in general. Another possibility is that she may feel intimidated by the large size and strength of a gorilla. Given these considerations, we can conclude that it is expected that Charla Nash would be anxious near a gorilla, so the answer is (A) yes."

What does this have to do with gorillas? While chimpanzees and gorillas are different primates, they are both great apes and share some similarities in behavior and appearance.\n3. Why would Charla Nash be anxious near a gorilla? Given her traumatic experience with a primate, it is reasonable to assume that she would experience anxiety or fear around other primates, including gorillas.\n4. Is this a factual statement? Yes, it is based on logic and understanding of the situation. It is important to consider the context and individual experiences of someone when making assumptions or predictions about their behavior."

As a result, she suffered severe injuries including the loss of her eyes, nose, and jaw. \n\nNow, let's focus on the question. The question is asking if it is expected that Charla Nash would be anxious near a gorilla. To answer this question, we need to consider a few things. \n\nFirstly, gorillas and chimpanzees are two different species. Charla Nash was attacked by a chimpanzee, not a gorilla. However, it is possible that the traumatic experience of being attacked by an ape may cause Charla Nash to experience anxiety around other apes, including gorillas. \n\nSecondly, it is important to note that gorillas are also very powerful animals and can be unpredictable. Therefore, it is not uncommon for people to feel anxious around gorillas in the wild. \n\nBased on these considerations, the answer to this question is (A) yes, it is expected that Charla Nash would be anxious near a gorilla. While it is not certain that Nash would experience anxiety around gorillas specifically, given what she has been through, it would not be surprising. Additionally, it is not uncommon for people to feel anxious around gorillas due to their size and unpredictability."

This incident received a lot of media attention and left Nash with extensive physical and emotional trauma.\n\nNext, we need to consider the nature of gorillas. Gorillas are large primates that are closely related to chimpanzees. Although they are generally known to be peaceful and gentle animals, they have the potential to be dangerous if they feel threatened or cornered. Additionally, gorillas are much larger and more powerful than humans, so being in close proximity to one can be intimidating.\n\nConsidering these facts, it is reasonable to assume that Charla Nash would be anxious near a gorilla. She has already experienced a traumatic incident involving a primate, and being near any large, potentially dangerous animal could trigger feelings of fear and anxiety. Additionally, Nash is likely aware of the risks associated with being near wild animals, especially given her previous experience with a chimpanzee.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. It is expected that Charla Nash would be anxious near a gorilla."
