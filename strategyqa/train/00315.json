                "content": "Firstly, it is important to establish who Walt Disney is. Walt Disney was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer, responsible for animated classics such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Bambi, and Cinderella. It is said that he revolutionized animation and created a legacy that still lives on to this day. \n\nNext, we need to look at Anderson Cooper. Anderson Cooper is an American journalist, television personality, and author. He is best known as the anchor of CNN's Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0.\n\nNow, to answer the question at hand, there is no reliable information to suggest that Walt Disney was ever interviewed by Anderson Cooper. It is important to note that Walt Disney passed away in 1966, while Anderson Cooper was born in 1967. Therefore, it is impossible for the two to have met, much less for Anderson Cooper to have interviewed Walt Disney.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer to the question is (B) no, as there is no evidence to suggest that Anderson Cooper ever interviewed Walt Disney."

This is unlikely, considering that Walt Disney passed away in 1966, while Anderson Cooper was born in 1967. \n\nAdditionally, Anderson Cooper was only a one-year-old baby when Walt Disney passed away, so there could not have been an interview between him and Disney. \n\nThus, the answer to the question is (B) no - Walt Disney was never interviewed by Anderson Cooper because they never had the opportunity to cross paths due to the significant age difference between them."
