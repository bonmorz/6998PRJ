Therefore, it is not an animal or a plant, and it doesn't have organs like a human body. \n\nBreast cancer is a disease that affects the cells of the breast tissue, which is found in mammals, including humans. So, since amoebas are not mammals and they don't have breasts, it is safe to say that they cannot get breast cancer. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes, amoebas are safe from breast cancer."

These organisms do not have breasts or breast tissue, which is the primary location for breast cancer to occur. Therefore, it is safe to say that amoebas cannot develop breast cancer or be affected by it. Hence, the correct answer is (A) yes."

Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes, amoebas are safe from breast cancer."

It does not have a defined nucleus or organelles, and it moves by extending its body and then contracting it.\n\nNext, we must understand what breast cancer is. Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow uncontrollably. It is the most common cancer in women worldwide and can also affect men.\n\nNow, the question asks if amoebas are safe from breast cancer. Since amoebas do not have breasts or breast tissue, they cannot develop breast cancer. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, amoebas are safe from breast cancer.\n\nIn summary, the answer is (A) because amoebas do not have breast tissue and, therefore, cannot develop breast cancer."

They do not possess any mammary glands or breast tissues which are the origin of breast cancer. Thus, they cannot develop breast cancer.\n\nSecondly, we need to understand what breast cancer is. Breast cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the breast tissue. It primarily affects women, although it can also occur in men. The main risk factors for breast cancer include genetic mutations, age, personal or family history of breast cancer, exposure to estrogen, and being overweight.\n\nSince amoebas do not possess mammary glands or breast tissues and are not exposed to any of the above risk factors of breast cancer, it is safe to assume that they cannot develop it. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"yes,\" amoebas are safe from breast cancer."

Therefore, it is impossible for them to develop breast cancer. \n\nBased on this logic, the correct answer is (A) yes, amoebas are safe from breast cancer."
