Thiago Moises is a Brazilian mixed martial arts fighter who competed in the UFC lightweight division. The submission move he used on May 13, 2020, would need to be researched to see what it entailed.\n\nSecond, we need to understand what the Achilles is and how it can be injured. The Achilles tendon is that band of tissue that connects the heel bone to the calf muscles in your leg. When this tendon is injured, it can cause a lot of pain and even prevent you from walking or competing in sports.\n\nThird, based on the information provided, we can assume that Thiago Moises used a submission move on May 13, 2020, that could hypothetically hurt the Achilles. From this, we can conclude that the answer to the question is (A) yes. However, without further information on the specific submission move used by Moises, we cannot make an accurate prediction of whether or not it caused actual damage to the Achilles tendon."

Thiago Moises is a Brazilian mixed martial artist who competes in the lightweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). On May 13, 2020, he had a fight against Michael Johnson. In this fight, Thiago Moises used a heel hook submission move to defeat Michael Johnson.\n\nNow, let's understand what a heel hook submission move is and how it can potentially hurt the Achilles. A heel hook submission is a technique used in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and mixed martial arts, where the practitioner applies pressure on the opponent's heel, stretching the ligaments and tendons in the ankle joint. This can result in injuring or tearing the Achilles tendon, which is a strong fibrous cord that connects the calf muscles to the heel bone.\n\nConsidering the above information, we can conclude that Thiago Moises' submission move on May 13, 2020, can hypothetically hurt Achilles. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

Moises is known for using various types of submissions, including leg locks, arm bars, and chokes.\n\nThirdly, we need to identify the body part that the submission move targeted. The question specifically mentions Achilles, which is a prominent tendon located at the back of the ankle. \n\nFourthly, we need to determine whether the submission move Moises used could hypothetically hurt the Achilles. Without knowing the exact submission move used, we can't definitively say yes or no, but since the question is asking if it is possible in theory, we can assume it is theoretically possible for Moises to use a submission move that would put strain or pressure on the Achilles, leading to pain or injury.\n\nTherefore, based on the information we have, the answer is (A) yes, it is hypothetically possible for Thiago Moises to use a submission move in his May 13th, 2020 fight that could hurt the Achilles."
