According to research, wandering albatrosses are known to fly non-stop for up to 6 days and cover approximately 10,000 km (6,200 miles) in that time. \nNow, to determine if a wandering albatross could fly from Bucharest to New York City without a rest, we need to calculate the distance between the two cities. The distance between the two cities, calculated by the Haversine formula, is approximately 6,800 km (4,225 miles). \nSince the wandering albatross can fly up to 10,000 km (6,200 miles) without rest, it is clear that the wandering albatross can easily fly from Bucharest to New York City without any rest. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes."

They are known to fly thousands of miles over the ocean without stopping. \n\nSecond, we need to determine the distance between Bucharest and New York City. The straight-line distance between Bucharest and New York City is approximately 6,070 miles. \n\nThird, we need to consider the maximum range of the wandering albatross. The wandering albatross has a reported maximum range of up to 10,000 miles per flight. \n\nGiven that the distance between Bucharest and New York City is less than the maximum range of the wandering albatross, we can conclude that it is possible for a wandering albatross to fly from Bucharest to New York City without a rest.

Wandering albatrosses are known to have the largest wingspan of any bird, with the ability to fly for long distances without flapping their wings. In fact, they can fly for hours and cover hundreds of kilometers without rest. \n\nGiven their capabilities for long distance flight, it is possible that a wandering albatross could fly from Bucharest to New York City without a rest. However, it is important to note that the exact route of flight taken by the bird may vary depending on weather, wind patterns, and other environmental factors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, a wandering albatross could fly from Bucharest to New York City without a rest."

According to Google Maps, the distance between Bucharest, Romania and New York City, USA is approximately 7,020 miles.\n\nStep 2: Determine the average flight speed of a wandering albatross. According to experts, the average speed of a wandering albatross is around 55 miles per hour.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the flight time required for the albatross to cover the distance. As flight speed is distance over time, we can divide the distance 7,020 miles by the albatross's speed of 55 miles per hour to get 127.63 hours.\n\nStep 4: Consider the physical capabilities of the albatross. According to ornithologists, wandering albatrosses are known for their exceptional flying abilities and can stay in the air for weeks on end without needing to land.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, based on our calculations and expert opinions, it seems highly likely that a wandering albatross could fly from Bucharest to New York City without a rest.
