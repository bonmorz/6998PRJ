Radioactive waste is any material that contains radioactive elements (isotopes) that are no longer needed and considered as garbage. They can be harmful to living things for a long time (from thousands to millions of years). \n\nNext, we need to consider whether the United States Navy uses radioactive elements in their operations. The nuclear power used by the US Navy is a significant source of radioactive waste. The Navy has nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines that use nuclear reactors to generate electricity instead of traditional diesel fuel. Nuclear reactors work by splitting uranium atoms, releasing energy and producing heat. The heat is then used to power steam turbines, which generate electricity. \n\nDuring the operation of these nuclear-powered vessels, nuclear waste is generated. This nuclear waste is in the form of spent or used nuclear fuel, as well as other byproducts. This waste is highly radioactive and has to be stored carefully to prevent contamination or damage to the environment. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, the United States Navy creates radioactive waste as a result of their nuclear-powered vessels."
