                "content": "When you cook spaghetti, it should not be too slick. This is because if spaghetti is too slick, it means that it is overcooked and has absorbed too much water. Overcooked spaghetti can become mushy and lose its firm texture. \n\nThe optimal texture for cooked spaghetti is slightly firm or al dente, which means \"to the tooth\" in Italian. To achieve this texture, you typically cook spaghetti for about 8-12 minutes in a pot of boiling salted water. During the cooking process, some of the starchy water gets absorbed by the spaghetti, but not too much. \n\nTo test if spaghetti is al dente, you can take a piece of spaghetti out of the pot and bite into it. The spaghetti should be firm but tender, with a slight resistance to your teeth. If it is too hard or crunchy, it needs more time to cook. If it is too soft or mushy, it has been overcooked. \n\nIn summary, spaghetti should not be slick when cooked. It should have a slightly firm and tender texture, with a delicate bite."
