Therefore, the first thing we need to establish is the timeline of Guam's history. \n\nGuam was discovered by the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan in 1521, which is almost 300 years before Queen Victoria's reign. So, it's highly unlikely that the first European visitor to Guam, who would have been one of Magellan's crew members, could have been friends with someone who wasn't even born yet. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the first European visitor to Guam could not have been friends with Queen Victoria."
