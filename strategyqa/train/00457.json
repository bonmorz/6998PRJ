While there are certainly some movies that do follow this trope, there are also many that do not. For example, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Iron Man (played by Robert Downey Jr.) is a wealthy and successful industrialist who is also a technological genius. Similarly, in the Star Wars franchise, characters like Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia are both intelligent and capable, despite being labeled as \"nerdy\" in certain circles. \n\nOverall, while some movies may fall into the trap of depicting nerds as social outcasts or losers, there are plenty of examples where that is not the case. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

This term can have different meanings for different people, but generally, it refers to someone who is highly intelligent and passionate about academic subjects or hobbies that are not popular or mainstream. \n\nNext, we need to analyze the portrayal of nerds in movies. While there are certainly many movies that depict nerds as socially awkward or unpopular, not all of them do. In recent years, there have been movies that celebrate nerd culture and show nerds as capable, strong, and even heroic. \n\nFor example, movies like \"The Social Network\" and \"The Theory of Everything\" feature main characters who are undeniably nerdy but are also successful and respected in their fields. The Marvel Cinematic Universe is also full of characters who could be considered nerds, such as Tony Stark/Iron Man and Bruce Banner/The Hulk, who are not portrayed as losers but as important members of the superhero team. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, movies do not always show nerds as losers. While it is true that some movies do portray nerds negatively, there are also many examples of movies that depict them positively."

These characters can sometimes be cast as the \"underdogs\" to the more conventionally attractive and popular characters in a story. In this sense, one could argue that movies are portraying nerds in a negative light.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also many movies that portray intelligent characters in a positive light.

While there may be many stories that follow the \"nerd as underdog\" trope, there are also countless examples of movies that portray intelligent characters as heroes, successful professionals, or respected experts."
