The clock faces are illuminated at night by lights behind each of the clock faces, making them visible in the dark. \n\nSecondly, the clock mechanism itself, comprising a pendulum and gears, is housed inside the clock tower, and is constantly regulated to keep accurate time. This means that the clock can accurately tell time even in complete darkness. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes, the Palace of Westminster can tell time in the dark."

The clock boasts four dials, each with a diameter of around 23 feet, and uses almost 4000 pieces to work. \n\nThe clock face is made up of numerals formed using frosted glass so that the interior is lit up with electric incandescent lighting at night. These lights are backed by low wattage bulbs that are placed in front of aluminum paste to enhance the lit up numerals. \n\nTherefore, as the clock face is illuminated at night through electric lighting, it can indeed tell time in the dark. Hence, the answer is (A) yes."

It is the building in London that houses the British Parliament, including the House of Commons and the House of Lords. \n\nNext, we need to consider what it means to \"tell time in the dark.\" This implies that the Palace of Westminster has some sort of clock or time-telling mechanism that can be seen or read even in the absence of light. \n\nSo, can the Palace of Westminster tell time in the dark? The answer is yes. This is because the building has a clock tower known as the Elizabeth Tower, which houses the famous Big Ben clock. The clock face is illuminated at night, and the tower is lit up as well, allowing the time to be easily seen even in the dark. Therefore, we can confidently choose answer (A) as the correct answer to this question."

It is a significant landmark in the city and includes the clock tower, commonly referred to as Big Ben. The clock tower has four clock faces, each measuring 23 feet in diameter. The hands of the clock are made of cast iron and are approximately 14 feet long for the hour hand and 9 feet long for the minute hand.\n\nNow, coming back to the question, can the Palace of Westminster tell time in the dark? The answer is yes, and the reason for this is that the clock faces of Big Ben are illuminated at night. The lighting system illuminates the clock faces from behind and is powerful enough to make the clock visible from miles away.\n\nTherefore, we can safely conclude that the Palace of Westminster can tell time in the dark, and the correct answer is option (A) yes."

At night, the clock faces are illuminated from within, making them visible and readable from a distance. So, the answer is (A) yes, the Palace of Westminster can tell time in the dark."
