The Kingdom of Hungary, on the other hand, existed as an independent sovereign state from 1000 until 1918-1920. Therefore, there was a significant time gap between the invention of the Walkman and the existence of the Kingdom of Hungary. \n\nSecondly, the Walkman was a western technological advancement that originated in Japan and became popular in the western world during the 1980s and 1990s. It is unlikely that this technology would have been readily available or widely used in a central European country like Hungary during the Kingdom era.\n\nFinally, there is no historical evidence or records to suggest the use of Walkmans in the Kingdom of Hungary. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
