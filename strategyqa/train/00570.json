Since the Earth is spherical, its curvature blocks the view of distant objects.\n4. Therefore, if there is anything obstructing the view of the sky from Wembley Arena (such as buildings or trees), and the moon is not directly above Wembley Arena, it will not be visible.\n5. Therefore, the answer is no, you cannot see the moon in Wembley Arena."

It is a large entertainment venue located in London, which is a heavily populated area with a significant amount of light pollution. This light pollution can make it difficult to see celestial objects such as the moon, even at night.\nBased on these factors, it is unlikely that one would be able to see the moon from Wembley Arena.

Second, we need to know that the moon is an astronomical object that exists in space outside of Earth's atmosphere. Third, we need to consider the fact that we can only see the moon from Earth when it is visible in the sky and not obstructed from our view by clouds or other atmospheric conditions.\n\nBased on these factors, we can conclude that it is not possible to see the moon from Wembley Arena. The arena is enclosed and does not have an unobstructed view of the sky. Even if one were to step outside of the arena, they would still need to have a clear line of sight to the moon in order to see it, which may not always be possible depending on where the moon is in its orbit and the surrounding conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

The visibility of the moon depends on its phase, time of the day, weather conditions and geographical location.\n\nNow, the question is asking whether we can see the moon from inside Wembley Arena. Since the arena is an indoor space, it is not possible to see the moon from this location. So, the answer to the question is (B) no.\n\nIn summary, the answer to the question is based on our understanding of the geographical location of Wembley Arena and the visibility of the moon from that location."
