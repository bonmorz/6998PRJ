Therefore, we would need 16 shoes for the octuplets. However, the question asks if four shoes would be insufficient, which means we need to compare 4 with 16. Since 4 is less than 16, four shoes would not be enough for the octuplets. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, four shoes would be insufficient."
