It is not a common animal found in urban cities like Shanghai. \n\nSecondly, it's important to note that red pandas are not commonly kept as pets, and therefore it is unlikely that someone would have a pet red panda walking around the streets of Shanghai. \n\nThirdly, if a red panda were to escape from a zoo or wildlife park in Shanghai, it would most likely be reported immediately and captured by authorities, making it even less likely to see one just wandering around the city. \n\nTaking all these factors into consideration, we can conclude that it is not normal to see a red panda in Shanghai outside of a zoo, making the answer (B) no."

It is a rare and endangered species that lives in a specific habitat, including bamboo forests and temperate forests. \n\nNext, we need to consider the location - Shanghai. Shanghai is a major metropolitan city in Eastern China, and it is not part of the red panda's natural range. Red pandas are not found in cities or urban areas, especially not outside of a zoo or wildlife sanctuary.\n\nBased on these factors, we can conclude that it is not normal to see a red panda in Shanghai outside of a zoo.
