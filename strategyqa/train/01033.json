Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

To answer this question, we need to consider whether or not this is a common practice.\n\nOne way to do this is to think about the types of seafood that are commonly used as pizza toppings. Some common options might include shrimp, anchovies, or even squid. However, the Black Sea is not known for these types of creatures specifically.\n\nInstead, the Black Sea is known for its sturgeon, which is a type of fish that is often used to make caviar. While some people might put caviar on their pizza, this is not a common practice and would likely be quite expensive. Additionally, sturgeon is an endangered species, so it is not ethical or sustainable to use it as a pizza topping.\n\nGiven these factors, we can surmise that people do not typically put creatures from the Black Sea on their pizza. However, as with any cultural practice, there may be individuals or regions where this is more common. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no."
