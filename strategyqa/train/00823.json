As of August 2021, Tyson Fury is the WBC heavyweight champion. \n\nNext, we need to determine if Jack Dempsey and Tyson Fury fought each other. However, this is not possible because of the age difference between the two boxers. Jack Dempsey retired in 1927, which is around 90 years ago, and Tyson Fury was born in 1988, which means he is currently 33 years old. Therefore, it is not possible for Jack Dempsey to fight Tyson Fury or any other modern WBC heavyweight champion.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the answer to the question is no, Jack Dempsey did not fight the current WBC heavyweight champion."
