The first major comic book publishers, including DC Comics, emerged in the late 1930s, which was decades after Taft left the office. Therefore, Taft could not have read DC Comics.

He was the 27th president of the United States, who served from 1909 to 1913. \n\nNext, we need to understand what DC Comics are. DC Comics is a company that publishes comic books featuring various characters, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and others. \n\nNow, we can combine these two facts and ask whether President Taft, who lived during the early 20th century, read DC Comics. \n\nThe answer is most likely no. DC Comics was founded in 1934, after President Taft had already passed away in 1930. Therefore, it is unlikely that he had the opportunity to read any DC Comics during his lifetime. \n\nAdditionally, even if DC Comics had existed during President Taft's lifetime, as an adult and political figure, he may not have been interested in reading comic books. Therefore, we can confidently say that the answer is (B) no."

DC Comics is a major American comic book publisher and the home of iconic superhero characters such as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, among others. \n\nNow, we can combine these two pieces of information to answer the question. Since President Taft served as President before DC Comics was even founded (it was founded in 1934), it is impossible for him to have read or even heard of DC Comics. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, he did not read DC Comics."
