Spiders are not typically found in the sea or along the shoreline where sea otters live. They are land-dwelling creatures that live in a variety of habitats, such as forests, fields, and gardens.\n\nTherefore, based on our understanding of sea otters' diet and their natural habitat, we can conclude that sea otters do not eat spiders. The answer is (B) no."

Sea otters are marine animals that primarily feed on creatures that can be found in the sea, such as crustaceans, fish, and mollusks. They are not adapted to live on land and therefore do not typically hunt for land animals. \n\nSpiders, on the other hand, are not typically found in the sea. They are land creatures and cannot survive underwater. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a sea otter would eat a spider. \n\nHence, the answer to the question is (B) no, as sea otters do not typically eat spiders."
