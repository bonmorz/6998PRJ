So, if Pantheon has a name that is shared by any other building or landmark, then it does not have a unique name. \n\nTo answer the question, we need to do some research. We can start by looking up the Pantheon and seeing if any other structures or monuments share its name. A quick search reveals that there are several other Pantheons around the world, including one in Rome and one in Athens. This means that the name \"Pantheon\" is not unique to the Parisian structure. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Pantheon in Paris does not have a unique name."
