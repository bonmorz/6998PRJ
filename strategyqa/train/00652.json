A compact disc typically consists of a clear polycarbonate plastic substrate, a reflective layer of aluminum, a protective layer of lacquer, and a label.\n\nNext, we need to understand what magma is. Magma is molten rock beneath the earth's surface that is typically between 700\u00b0C and 1300\u00b0C.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that a compact disc would most likely melt in magma. This is because the polycarbonate plastic substrate and protective lacquer layers have low melting points and would melt quickly in such extreme temperatures.

A compact disc, or CD, is typically made of a polycarbonate plastic layer that has been coated with a layer of aluminum and a layer of lacquer. These layers allow the CD to hold digital information in the form of pits and bumps on the surface. \n\nNext, we need to understand what magma is. Magma is a molten mixture of rock, minerals, and gases that is found beneath the Earth's surface. It is extremely hot, with temperatures ranging from 700 to 1300 degrees Celsius. \n\nGiven the extreme temperatures of magma, it is safe to say that a compact disc would not be able to withstand the heat and would melt. The polycarbonate plastic layer would likely melt first, followed by the aluminum and lacquer layers. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, a compact disc would melt in magma."

Magma is molten rock that is located deep within the Earth and has a temperature range of 700-1300\u00b0C (1292-2372\u00b0F). \n\nBased on this information, it is clear that the temperature of magma is significantly higher than the melting point of all the materials used in the construction of a compact disc. Therefore, when exposed to magma, the compact disc would melt. Hence, the answer to the question is (A) yes, a compact disc would melt in magma."
