However, some people with disabilities, end-stage renal disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may also be eligible. An eleventh-grader is typically around 16 or 17 years old, which means they are nowhere close to 65 years old. They are also less likely to have a qualifying disability than someone who is older.
