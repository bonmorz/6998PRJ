Therefore, he has no experience or training in diving to the depths of the ocean.\n\nNext, we need to determine the depth of the Red Sea's deepest point. The Red Sea's deepest point is the Suakin Trough, which is around 7,254 feet (2,211 meters) deep.\n\nBased on these two pieces of information, it would be very difficult for Nuno Gomes to dive to the Red Sea's deepest point. Diving to such depths requires extensive training, experience, and specialized equipment. It is also very dangerous, and requires a high level of physical fitness and mental preparation. Nuno Gomes, being a retired football player with no background in diving, would find it extremely challenging to accomplish such a task. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

While it's possible that he has some experience or training in diving, it's unlikely that he has the necessary expertise or equipment to safely dive to such a depth.\n\nWe also need to consider the challenges associated with diving to such depths. At these extreme depths, the water pressure can be immense, posing a serious risk of injury or death. Additionally, the lack of light and oxygen can make it difficult to navigate and perform tasks underwater.\n\nTherefore, given all of these factors, it's likely that it would be very difficult (if not impossible) for Nuno Gomes to dive to the Red Sea's deepest point.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Red Sea's deepest point is the Suakin Trough, with a depth of approximately 7,160 feet or 2,182 meters. \n\nNext, we need to consider who Nuno Gomes is and what his capabilities are. Without any additional context, we cannot assume anything about Nuno Gomes' diving abilities. However, we can make some general assumptions based on the average person's capabilities. \n\nAccording to the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI), the average recreational diver can go as deep as 130 feet or 40 meters. Going deeper than this requires technical training and equipment. Even professional divers, who have extensive training and experience, have limits on how deep they can dive. \n\nTherefore, based on this information, we can conclude that it would indeed be very difficult for Nuno Gomes or any average person to dive to the Red Sea's deepest point."

No, it is not possible for humans to dive to such extreme depths without special equipment and training. The pressure and lack of oxygen at such depths would be fatal to an unaided person.\n4. Therefore, it would be very difficult, or rather impossible, for Nuno Gomes or anyone else to dive to the Red Sea's deepest point without proper equipment and training.
