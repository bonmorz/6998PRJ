He is considered one of the most influential philosophers in history. \n\nNext, we need to understand what the House of Lords is. The House of Lords is the upper house of the British Parliament, which consists of members who have been appointed or inherited their seats. It is not an ancient Greek concept or institution, which is important to note when considering whether Aristotle could have been a member. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, because Aristotle was not a member of the House of Lords, which is a specific British institution that did not exist during his lifetime or in his cultural context."

It is composed of hereditary peers, life peers, and bishops.\n\nNow, we can answer the question. Aristotle was not a member of the House of Lords because he lived in ancient Greece, which is not part of the United Kingdom. Additionally, the House of Lords was not established until much later, in the 14th century CE. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

He was a student of Plato and taught Alexander the Great. \n\nBased on this information, we can say with certainty that Aristotle was not a member of the House of Lords. Why? Because the House of Lords is part of the UK's political system, which did not exist until many centuries after Aristotle's death. Moreover, Aristotle did not hail from the UK or any other region that was politically or geographically linked to the UK. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Aristotle was not a member of the House of Lords."
