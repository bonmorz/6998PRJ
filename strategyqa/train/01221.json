Mussolini was known for wearing clothes and accessories that emphasized his style and personality, but there is no specific evidence about his shoe size. Likewise, while Bj\u00f6rnsson's impressive size and strength may suggest that he wears large shoes, there is no specific information about his shoe size that relates to Mussolini.\n\nGiven this lack of evidence or logical connection, the answer to the question is simply \"no\" or (B).

There is no real way of comparing the two as they were from different time periods and were known for different things. Additionally, there is no publicly available information that indicates who had bigger feet or wore bigger shoes. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is (B) no, because we cannot make any assumptions or comparisons."
