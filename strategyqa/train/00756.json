Mark Twain, whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens, was an American author and humorist. \n\nNow, moving on to the question itself. The question is asking whether Mark Twain was a struggling inventor. This is a bit tricky because Mark Twain did have an interest in inventions and patents, but he was not necessarily a struggling inventor.\n\nMark Twain's interest in inventions led him to experiment with various technologies, such as an automatic typesetting machine and a self-pasting scrapbook. However, these inventions did not bring him financial success nor were they notable in their production. \n\nSo, to answer the question, we can say that Mark Twain had an interest in inventing but was not a struggling inventor as he did not solely focus on it nor gain significant success from his inventions. The correct answer, therefore, is (B) no."

Therefore, we need to focus on his inventions. \n\nSecondly, we need to find evidence to support any answer. Mark Twain did have an interest in inventing, but he was not considered a struggling inventor. In fact, he had invented a self-pasting scrapbook that was very successful and well-received in the market. It was a unique invention that made collecting clippings from newspapers and magazines easier, and it was even endorsed by the prestigious Harper's magazine.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, the answer is (B) no, and we can conclude that Mark Twain was not a struggling inventor."

While he is known for his literary works such as The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, he was not primarily known for being an inventor. \n\nNext, we need to define what is meant by a \"struggling inventor.\" Generally, this would mean someone who is having difficulty inventing or bringing their inventions to market, often due to financial constraints. \n\nWith these two pieces of information, we can confidently answer that Mark Twain was not a struggling inventor. While he did file several patents during his lifetime, they were largely for inventions that did not gain widespread popularity or financial success. His main career focus and success was in writing and humor, not inventing. Therefore, option (B) no, is the correct answer."
