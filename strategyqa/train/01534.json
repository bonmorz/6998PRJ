Joey is approximately the size of a jellybean at birth and can grow up to 8 inches in length.\n\nOn the other hand, Scooby Doo is a fictional character, but we can assume that he is a Great Dane, a breed of dog that weighs between 100 to 200 pounds and stands about 2 to 3 feet tall. His size alone makes it impossible for him to fit in the kangaroo's pouch, which is primarily made for newborn joeys, not fully-grown dogs.\n\nAdditionally, kangaroos typically live in Australia, while Scooby Doo is from America. Therefore, it is highly improbable for him to be found in the natural habitat of kangaroos. Hence, the correct answer is (B) no, Scooby Doo cannot fit in a kangaroo pouch."

Kangaroo pouches can vary in size, but on average they are around 18 inches long and 8 inches wide. \n\nNext, we need to consider the size of Scooby Doo. Scooby Doo is a fictional animated dog, but he is typically portrayed as being about the same size as a Great Dane or another larger breed. These dogs typically weigh between 100-200 pounds and can be up to 6 feet tall. \n\nGiven Scooby Doo's size and the size of a kangaroo pouch, it is unlikely that he could fit inside. The pouch would not be large enough to accommodate his body size, even if he were to curl up tightly. Additionally, kangaroo pouches are meant to hold newborn joeys and not fully grown dogs. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Scooby Doo could not fit in a kangaroo pouch."

Scooby Doo, on the other hand, is a Great Dane dog, which is a large breed and can weigh up to 200 pounds. \n\nSecondly, even if we assume that a kangaroo pouch is big enough for Scooby Doo to squeeze into, it would not be a suitable place for him to be in. In the wild, kangaroo pouches are filled with fur, milk, and comforts that provide warmth and safety to joeys. For Scooby Doo, being in a kangaroo pouch would be uncomfortable, as it is cramped, dark, and unfamiliar. \n\nTherefore, based on the size and unsuitability of a kangaroo pouch as a habitat, the answer is no, Scooby Doo could not fit in a kangaroo pouch."

While kangaroo pouches can hold their joeys, or baby kangaroos, they are not very large. They are designed to accommodate newborn joeys, which are only a few inches long and weigh less than a pound.\n\nBased on these facts, it is safe to say that there is no way Scooby Doo could fit in a kangaroo pouch, even if he curled up tightly.

Great Danes can typically weigh up to 175 pounds and stand over two feet tall at the shoulders. This is much larger than a kangaroo's average weight of about 55-200 pounds and height of 3-8 feet.\n\nTherefore, based on these size comparisons, it is highly unlikely that Scooby Doo could fit in a kangaroo pouch.
