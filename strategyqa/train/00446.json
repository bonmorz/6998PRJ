Salinger's most successful work, which is \"The Catcher in the Rye.\" \n\nNext, we need to determine if this book is influential to killers. There have been several high-profile cases where the killers have stated they were inspired by or identified with the book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. For example, John Hinckley Jr., who attempted to assassinate President Reagan in 1981, was found to have a copy of the book on him at the time of the shooting. \n\nAdditionally, the book's themes of alienation, disillusionment, and rebellion may resonate with individuals who feel disenfranchised or disconnected from society. \n\nTherefore, based on these factors, the answer to the question is (A) yes, Salinger's most successful work may be influential to killers."
