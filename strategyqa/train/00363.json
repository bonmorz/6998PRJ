The Donatello crucifix refers to a famous piece of art, specifically a wooden crucifix sculpture created by the Italian Renaissance artist Donatello in the 15th century. Next, the question asks if the Donatello crucifix was identified in 2020 as life-size. To answer this, we need to understand what is meant by \"life-size.\" A life-size sculpture refers to a sculpture that is proportional to the actual size of a real-life object or person. Since the Donatello crucifix was a wooden sculpture, it is already technically life-size as it was created to depict a life-size human figure on the cross.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, as the Donatello crucifix was already life-size when it was created in the 15th century and there was no identification or change in its size in 2020."

To do that, we need to look for information about any identification made in 2020 relating to the crucifix. \n\nAs there is no context to the question and no further information provided here about any recent identification, we cannot assume that any such identification took place in 2020 or that it related to the size of the crucifix.
