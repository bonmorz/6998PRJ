                "content": "Firstly, the question is asking if it was typical to see Johnny Cash in a rainbow-colored outfit on stage. To answer this, we need to consider several factors. \n\nJohnny Cash is known for his signature all-black outfit, which he wore for most of his career. This included a black suit, shirt, and boots. However, there are instances where he wore other colored outfits. \n\nOne famous example is the time he wore a bright red suit during his concert at San Quentin State Prison in 1969. This was a departure from his usual outfit, but still within the range of bright and solid colors.\n\nHowever, there is no record or evidence of Johnny Cash ever wearing a rainbow-colored outfit on stage. This would have been incredibly unusual for him, given his preference for more conservative attire. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, it was not typical to see Johnny Cash on stage in a rainbow-colored outfit."
