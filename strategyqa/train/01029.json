Depending on the location of the college, there may be a chance of seeing frost during these ceremonies. However, in many places across the United States, the average temperature in May and June is well above freezing, so frost is less likely to occur.\n\nOverall, while it is possible to see frost during some college commencements, it is not necessarily common across the board. The answer to this question is (A) yes, but with some caveats."

College commencements typically occur in late spring, which is generally considered a warmer time of year in most parts of the world. \n\nHowever, even during the late spring, there may be some regions where the temperatures drop enough overnight to cause frost. This is particularly true for northern regions, mountainous areas, and places with a continental climate. \n\nTherefore, based on these facts, it is reasonable to say that it is common to see frost during some college commencements.

Next, we need to understand what is meant by \"college commencements\". College commencements are graduation ceremonies that mark the completion of a student's degree program.\n\nNow, to answer the question, we need to consider whether it is common to see frost during college commencements. This depends on the timing and location of the commencement ceremony. If the ceremony takes place in the winter or early spring, when temperatures are more likely to drop below freezing, it is more common to see frost. On the other hand, if the ceremony takes place in the summer or fall, when temperatures are typically warmer, it is less common to see frost.\n\nOverall, the answer is (A) yes, it is common to see frost during some college commencements, depending on the timing and location of the ceremony."
