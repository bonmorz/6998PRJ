The Vietnam War officially began in 1955 and ended in 1975. \n\nNow, we can calculate whether Alan Alda was old enough to have fought in the Vietnam War. To have fought in the Vietnam War, Alan Alda would have needed to be at least 18 years old by the time the war began in 1955. Subtracting 1955 from 1936, we get 19, so Alda was at least 19 years old when the Vietnam War began. This means that he was indeed old enough to have fought in the war. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

However, individuals could volunteer to join the military at the age of 17 with parental consent. Therefore, if Alan Alda was 17 years old or older before the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, he was eligible to fight in the war.\n\nSince Alan Alda was born in 1936, he would have turned 17 in 1953, which is two years before the start of the Vietnam War. This means that he was old enough to join the military during the Vietnam War if he chose to do so. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, Alan Alda is old enough to have fought in the Vietnam War."
