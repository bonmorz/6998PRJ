There are 24 letters in the Ancient Greek alphabet. \nSince 24 is less than 40, the answer is (B) no, seasons of Survivor are not surpassed by the number of Ancient Greek letters."

This number is currently 40 as of 2021. \n\nAncient Greek letters refer to the alphabet used by the Greeks in ancient times. This alphabet consisted of 24 letters, including alpha, beta, gamma, delta, etc. \n\nNow, we need to compare the two. Are the seasons of Survivor more than or equal to the number of Ancient Greek letters? \n\nNo, they are not. 40 (seasons of Survivor) is much less than 24 (Ancient Greek letters). Therefore, the answer is (B) no."
