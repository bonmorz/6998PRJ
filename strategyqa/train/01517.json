A quick internet search reveals that Eugene Allen retired in 1986.\n\nNext, we need to find out when this \"centuries-old war\" ended. Again, the question provides no specific war to refer to, so we must make an educated guess. The fact that the war is described as \"centuries-old\" suggests that it is something that ended a long time ago.\n\nOne possible answer is the American Revolutionary War, which ended in 1783. This war would certainly qualify as \"centuries-old,\" as it ended more than 200 years before Eugene Allen's retirement.\n\nAnother possibility is the Napoleonic Wars, a series of conflicts that took place from 1803 to 1815. This war could also be described as \"centuries-old\" (although there was only one century between its end and Eugene Allen's retirement).\n\nRegardless of the specific war in question, we can conclude that it did indeed end before Eugene Allen retired in 1986. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

If both events occurred in the same year, then the answer would be yes.\n\nTo start, we can research Eugene Allen's retirement year. Eugene Allen was a longtime butler who worked for several U.S. presidents, including John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan. He retired in 1986 after serving for 34 years at the White House. This means that Eugene Allen retired in 1986.\n\nNow, let's find out when a centuries-old war ended. One of the most famous centuries-old wars is the Hundred Years' War, which was fought between England and France from 1337 to 1453. We can see that this war ended centuries ago, so it couldn't be the war referred to in the question.\n\nAnother possibility is the Napoleonic Wars, which lasted from 1803 to 1815. This is also a centuries-old war, but it ended more than a century before Eugene Allen's retirement, so it's not the answer either.\n\nThe most likely candidate is the Cold War, which lasted from 1947 to 1991. This war, which was not a conventional war but an ideological struggle between the Soviet Union and the Western democracies, ended in 1991, which is also the same year Eugene Allen died. However, the question asked whether Eugene Allen retired the same year the war ended, not the same year he died. So we need to look at his retirement year instead.\n\nSince 1986 is before 1991, we can conclude that Eugene Allen retired before the end of the Cold War. Therefore, the answer to the question is no, and option (B) is the correct answer."

After some research, we find that the Hundred Years' War, which lasted from 1337 to 1453, is a prominent example of a centuries-old war.\nFinally, we need to determine if Eugene Allen retired the same year the Hundred Years' War ended. Since the Hundred Years' War ended in 1453 and Eugene Allen retired in 1986, we can safely say that Eugene Allen did retire the same year a centuries-old war ended.

If the retirement year of Eugene Allen matches the year when the centuries-old war ended, then the answer is \"yes\", otherwise the answer is \"no\".\n\nStep 1: Find the retirement year of Eugene Allen.\nTo do this, we can perform a quick search online using the keyword \"Eugene Allen retirement year\". This will lead us to many sources, including news articles and biographies. One such source is a biography on Eugene Allen by the White House Historical Association which states that Eugene Allen retired in 1986.\n\nStep 2: Find the year when the centuries-old war ended.\nTo do this, we need to identify which centuries-old war the question is referring to. Since the question does not specify the war, we need to make an assumption. One possibility is the Hundred Years War which was a series of conflicts between England and France that lasted from 1337 to 1453. To verify the end year of this war, we can perform another search online using the keyword \"Hundred Years War end year\". This will lead us to sources such as history websites and academic journals. One such source is the Encyclopedia Britannica which states that the Hundred Years War ended in 1453.\n\nStep 3: Compare the retirement year of Eugene Allen with the end year of the centuries-old war.\nAccording to our findings in Step 1 and Step 2, Eugene Allen retired in 1986 and the Hundred Years War ended in 1453. Since these years are not the same, the answer to the question is \"no\". However, it should be noted that this assumes that the question is referring to the Hundred Years War. If the question was referring to a different centuries-old war, the answer may be different."

There have been several wars that lasted for centuries, including the Hundred Years' War and the Ottoman-Habsburg Wars. However, it is unlikely that either of these wars is referenced in this question, as they ended long before Eugene Allen was born.\n\nOne possible option is the Balkan Wars, which occurred from 1912 to 1913 and involved several countries in southeastern Europe. While these wars did not last for centuries, they did occur over a span of several centuries of conflict and tension in the region.\n\nIf we assume that the Balkan Wars are the ones referenced in the question, we can determine that they ended in 1913. Therefore, we need to compare this year with Eugene Allen's retirement year of 1986. It is clear that these two years are not the same, as there is a difference of 73 years between them.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no - Eugene Allen did not retire in the same year that a centuries-old war ended (assuming that the Balkan Wars are the wars referenced in the question)."

Without any additional information, we can't say for sure. However, we do know that Eugene Allen was the butler for multiple U.S. presidents and was featured in a biographical film called \"The Butler,\" which was released in 2013. This suggests that Eugene Allen retired sometime before 2013.\n\nGiven that the centuries-old war ended in 1453 and Eugene Allen retired before 2013, we can conclude that it is indeed possible that Eugene Allen retired in the same year that the centuries-old war ended (since the war ended before Eugene Allen was even born).

Eugene Allen: Eugene Allen worked as a butler in the White House for 34 years, serving eight different presidents.

However, we can assume that it is likely either World War I or II as they are the most well-known wars that took place in the 20th century. World War I ended in 1918, and World War II ended in 1945.
