Cesar Millan is a Mexican-American dog behaviorist who gained popularity through his television series \"The Dog Whisperer.\" He is known for his ability to rehabilitate aggressive and misbehaving dogs. \n\nNext, we need to understand what a short-eared dog is. The short-eared dog, also known as the short-eared zorro, is a species of wild dog native to Central and South America. \n\nNow, we can answer the question. Since the short-eared dog is a wild animal species and Cesar Millan's expertise is in dog behavior, it is unlikely that he has tamed a short-eared dog. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

This term is not specific to a certain breed or type of dog, but rather is a description of a physical trait. Many breeds of dogs can have short ears, including Pugs, French Bulldogs, and Boston Terriers.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can make an educated guess about whether or not Cesar Millan has tamed a short-eared dog.
