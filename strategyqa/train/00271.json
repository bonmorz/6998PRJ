Mount Sharp is a mountain located in the Gale Crater of Mars.\n\nNow we need to think about the timeline. Apollo 15 was in 1971, while NASA's Curiosity rover (which took pictures of Mount Sharp) didn't land on Mars until 2012. So it's impossible for the crew of Apollo 15 to have taken pictures of Mount Sharp since they didn't visit Mars.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, the crew of Apollo 15 did not take pictures of Mount Sharp."
