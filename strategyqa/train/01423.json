So, is there any evidence to suggest that bald eagles have ever nested on Mount Sharp? There is no known evidence or reports of bald eagles nesting on mount sharp. Therefore, the answer to the question is no, bald eagles do not nest on Mount Sharp."

Do bald eagles live on Mars? \nNo, bald eagles do not live on Mars as bald eagles are a species of bird that exist on Earth. \n\n3. Do bald eagles typically nest on mountains? \nBald eagles can nest on trees, cliffs, and sometimes man-made structures like power poles. While mountains may sometimes be a location where bald eagles nest, it is not a requirement for them to do so. \n\n4. Conclusion: \nAs bald eagles do not live on Mars and while it is possible for them to nest on mountains, it is not a requirement for them to do so. Therefore, the answer to the question \"Do bald eagles nest on Mount Sharp?\" is no."
