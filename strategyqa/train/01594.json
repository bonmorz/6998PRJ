According to Genesis 6-9, God saw that the wickedness of humanity had become so great on the earth that he decided to flood the earth and start over with a new generation of righteous people. He instructed Noah, a righteous man, to build an ark and gather a male and female of every kind of animal and bird, as well as Noah's own family.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many people were in Noah's family. Genesis 7:13 states, \"On that very day, Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark.\" This means that there were eight people in total on the ark: Noah, his wife, his three sons, and their wives.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, there were eight humans on Noah's ark."

We know from the story that Noah was tasked by God to build an ark to save himself, his family, and the animals from a great flood that God was going to send to cleanse the earth of evil. \n\nSecondly, in Genesis 7:7-9 (New International Version), it states: \"And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood. Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground, male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah.\" \n\nFrom this passage, we can see that there were eight human occupants of the ark: Noah, his wife, and their three sons along with their wives. So, the correct answer is (A) yes, there were eight humans on Noah's Ark."
