Christopher Nolan is a filmmaker known for his work on movies such as Inception and The Dark Knight trilogy.

To be indebted means to owe something to someone else, such as money or gratitude. \n\nSo the question is whether Christopher Nolan owes something to Bob Kane. In this case, the answer is yes because without Bob Kane's creation of the Batman character, Christopher Nolan would not have had the opportunity to make the Dark Knight trilogy. Therefore, Nolan owes a debt of gratitude to Kane for creating the character that helped make his films possible."

Christopher Nolan is a British-American filmmaker known for directing popular movies such as The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, and Dunkirk. Bob Kane, on the other hand, was an American comic book artist who co-created Batman in 1939.\n\nNow, the question asks whether Nolan is indebted to Kane. To be indebted means to owe gratitude, money, or favor to someone. Here, we are not talking about money or any other material benefit, but rather artistic creations. \n\nAnalyzing their works, we can see that Nolan directed The Dark Knight trilogy, which included Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises. These movies were based on the character Batman, who was co-created by Bob Kane.\n\nTherefore, Nolan's artistic interpretation of Batman and his inclusion of the character in his movies is directly indebted to Kane's original creation of Batman. Without Kane's initial creation of Batman, Nolan would not have had the opportunity to work with the character and create his own take on him. \n\nHence, the answer is (A) yes, Christopher Nolan is indebted to Bob Kane for creating the character of Batman, which Nolan used as a basis for his films."

In this case, the answer is yes, Christopher Nolan is indebted to Bob Kane. \n\nTo elaborate, Christopher Nolan did not create the character of Batman. Instead, he used the character and the world created by Bob Kane to tell his own story through his films. Without Bob Kane creating Batman in the first place, there would be no Batman trilogy directed by Christopher Nolan. Therefore, it is only fair to say that Nolan is indebted to Bob Kane for the opportunity to bring Batman to the big screen."
