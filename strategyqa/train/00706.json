Bush, was the 41st President of the United States, and his mother, Barbara Bush, was a former First Lady. Both of his parents were Americans and primarily spoke English. Additionally, George W. Bush spent most of his childhood and educational life in the United States unless studying abroad. \n\nTherefore, based on these facts, we can conclude that George W. Bush did not grow up speaking Cantonese, making (B) the correct answer."
