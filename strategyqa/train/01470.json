It's usually done when a vaginal birth would put the baby or mother at risk, and it involves making an incision in the mother's abdomen and uterus to remove the baby.\n\nSecond, we need to consider whether ducks give birth in the same way as humans. Ducks are a type of bird, and birds lay eggs instead of giving live birth. So, ducks do not have the same reproductive system as humans, and they do not have the need for a Caesarean section.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, a duck would not ever need a Caesarean section."
