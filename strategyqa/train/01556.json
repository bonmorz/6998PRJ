The movie was released in 1969, so the producer must have been of adult age at that time, which we can assume to be at least 18 years old. \n\nNext, we need to find the current year. Assuming this question is being asked in 2021, which is the year mentioned in the question, we know the current year.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the age of the producer based on the current year. To do this, we can subtract the birth year of the producer from the current year. \n\nSo, if the producer was born in or before 1941, they would be 80 years old or older in 2021 and thus the answer would be \"yes.\" However, if the producer was born after 1941, they would be younger than 80 years old in 2021 and the answer would be \"no.\"\n\nSince this question does not provide us with the birth year of the producer, we cannot determine their age in 2021, but we can say that it is not necessarily true that they will be an octogenarian. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

Easy Rider was released in 1969, so we can assume that the producer was probably already an adult at that time. Let's say the producer was at least 25 years old when the movie was released. That means their birth year would be 1944 or earlier. \n\nNow, we need to determine whether the producer will turn 80 years old or older in 2021. To do this, we need to subtract the producer's birth year from 2021. \n\n2021 - 1944 = 77 \n\nSo, the producer will only be 77 years old in 2021, not yet an octogenarian (someone who is 80 years or older).

Easy Rider is a movie that was released in 1969 and was produced by Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and Terry Southern. However, the question specifically refers to the producer as a singular entity. \n\nAfter doing some research, we can determine that the sole producer of the film is Bert Schneider. \n\nNext, we need to figure out when Bert Schneider was born. According to his IMDb page, he was born on May 5, 1933. \n\nNow we can do the math. If we subtract 1933 from 2021, we get 88. Therefore, Bert Schneider will turn 88 years old in 2021. \n\nSince the question asks if he will become an octogenarian (a term referring to someone who is between 80-89 years old), and he will be 88, the answer is \"yes\", right? \n\nNo, because the term \"octogenarian\" refers to someone who is between 80-89 years old, meaning they have not yet turned 90. So even though Bert Schneider will be 88 years old in 2021, he will still be in his 80s, and therefore the answer is (B) no."

Easy Rider is a classic American film that was released in 1969. The producer of this iconic film was Peter Fonda, who was born on February 23, 1940. Therefore, his age in 2021 would be:\n\n2021 - 1940 = 81 years old\n\nSo, the question is essentially asking whether Peter Fonda, the producer of Easy Rider, will be 81 years old in 2021.
