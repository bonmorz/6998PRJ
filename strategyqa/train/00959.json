The war started in April 1898 and ended in August of the same year. \n\nNow we need to investigate Switzerland's involvement in the war. Switzerland is a landlocked country in Europe and was not involved in the Spanish-American War. Switzerland remained neutral during the conflict and did not take a side. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no."

The main cause of the war was the U.S. government's support for Cuban independence from Spanish rule. In the end, the United States emerged victorious and gained several territories from Spain.\n\nNow, we need to determine if Switzerland, a country in Europe, supported the United States during this conflict. We can do this by looking at historical records and diplomatic relations between the two countries during that time.\n\nAfter conducting research, we find that Switzerland did not support or participate in the Spanish-American War. In fact, Switzerland declared its neutrality during the conflict, meaning it would not take sides or provide military support to any country involved.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Switzerland did not support the United States in the Spanish-American War."

This war took place in 1898, when the United States declared war on Spain over Spanish colonies in the Caribbean and Pacific. Switzerland, on the other hand, has a longstanding tradition of political neutrality and non-intervention in foreign conflicts.\n\nTherefore, it is highly unlikely that Switzerland would have supported the United States in the Spanish-American War. The country's foreign policy is based on the principle of not taking sides in conflicts or wars, and instead promoting peace and diplomacy. Hence, the answer is (B) no, Switzerland did not support the United States in the Spanish-American War."
