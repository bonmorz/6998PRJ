The war started in 1955-56, but American involvement escalated significantly in 1965, with the United States committing large numbers of troops to the conflict. \n\nNext, let's consider the number of American troops in Vietnam in 1965. According to historical accounts, President Lyndon B. Johnson authorized the deployment of 184,000 U.S. troops to Vietnam in July 1965. This number increased rapidly in subsequent months, with the total number of U.S. troops in Vietnam peaking at around 500,000 in 1968. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the answer to the question is (B) no, there were not fewer than 150,000 American troops in Vietnam in 1965. In fact, there were significantly more than that."

According to historical records, the number of US troops in Vietnam increased steadily from a few hundred in the early 1960s to over 184,000 by the end of 1965. Thus, there were certainly more than 150,000 troops in Vietnam in 1965. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Answer (A) is incorrect because it suggests that there were fewer than 150,000 troops in Vietnam in 1965, which is not the case. It's important to read the question carefully and consider all available information before picking an answer."

To answer this question, we can do some research and look at historical records. According to the Department of Defense, the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam in 1965 was approximately 184,000. This number is greater than 150,000, so we can say that the answer is \"no.\" However, the question is asking whether there were under 150,000 troops, so our answer should be the opposite of what we just determined.

If there were more than 150,000 American troops, then the answer to the question is \"no\" - which we arrived at in the previous step. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is actually \"yes.\" There were under 150,000 American troops in Vietnam in 1965."

So, it is possible that there were under 150,000 troops in 1965. \n\nNow, we need to check if this is true. The answer is (A) yes, meaning that there were under 150,000 American troops in Vietnam in 1965.
