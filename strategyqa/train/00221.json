A chess board is an 8x8 square grid, while a Shogi board is a 9x9 square grid. \n\nNow, let's consider the pieces used in each game. Chess and Shogi have different sets of pieces with different movements, meaning that you cannot simply swap out the pieces between the two games.\n\nAdditionally, Shogi has drops, which allow captured pieces to be returned to the board under the capturing player's control. This mechanic is not present in chess and would require modifications to the board to accommodate.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to convert a chess board to a Shogi board without significant modification to the board and the pieces used in the game. The answer, therefore, is (B) no."

Although there are some similarities in the movement of the pieces, some shogi pieces have unique moves that do not exist in chess.\n\nLastly, the way the game is played in shogi also differs from chess. For example, shogi allows the player to pick up captured pieces and put them back into play, which is not allowed in chess.\n\nGiven these differences, it is not possible to convert a chess board to a shogi board.

Additionally, the two games have different numbers and types of pieces. Chess has 16 pieces per player, including a king, queen, bishops, knights, rooks, and pawns. Shogi, on the other hand, has 20 pieces per player, including a king, rooks, bishops, gold generals, silver generals, knights, lances, and pawns. Therefore, the different pieces would not fit on a chess board. Furthermore, the setup and rules of the two games are also different. Shogi has a drop rule, where captured pieces can be placed on the board by the capturing player. Chess does not have a drop rule. Therefore, converting a chess board to a Shogi board is not possible, making the correct answer (B) no."
