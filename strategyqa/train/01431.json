After some research, it appears that while Yoot\u00f3 is indeed the traditional name for New Mexico as a whole, it is not commonly used to refer specifically to Albuquerque. In fact, Albuquerque's nickname is \"The Duke City.\" \n\nTherefore, we can confidently answer that the largest city in New Mexico is not also known as Yoot\u00f3. The correct answer is (B) no."
