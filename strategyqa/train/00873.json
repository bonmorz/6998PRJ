After his death in 2017, there was some confusion as to what would happen to his body. \n\nInitially, nobody wanted to claim the body or take responsibility for his funeral arrangements.

Now, the question is asking whether his body was unwanted or not. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to look at the events that followed his death. Manson's body was initially claimed by his longtime pen pal and friend, Michael Channels. However, Channels later gave up the claim, and another individual named Jason Freeman, who claims to be Manson's grandson, eventually gained custody of the body. \n\nFreeman then arranged for a private funeral, which was attended by a small group of people. This indicates that there was someone who wanted to take care of Manson's body and give him a proper burial, and therefore the answer to the question is (B) no, Manson's body was not unwanted."

Generally, an unwanted body refers to the body of a deceased person for whom no relatives or friends claim responsibility for burial or cremation. \n\nIn the case of Charles Manson, his body was initially unclaimed by his known relatives, who did not want to claim the body due to the controversy and negative publicity associated with Manson's life and crimes. \n\nHowever, a man named Jason Freeman, who claimed to be Manson's grandson, came forward to claim the body and arranged for his cremation. Therefore, based on these facts, we can conclude that Charles Manson's body was not unwanted, as it was eventually claimed and cremated by someone. \n\nHence, the correct answer to the question is B: No, Charles Manson's body was not unwanted."

Initially, there were conflicting reports, suggesting that his body was unclaimed or unwanted.

After years in prison, he died in 2017 at the age of 83. So, the question is asking whether his body was unwanted. In November 2017, after Manson's death, it was reported that his body was not claimed by any family member or relative. However, this does not necessarily mean that his body was unwanted. According to California law, the next of kin has the right to claim the body and decide on its disposition. In the case of Charles Manson, several people came forward claiming to be his next of kin, including a grandson, a pen pal, and a former friend. Eventually, his body was claimed by a man named Jason Freeman, who claimed to be his grandson, and Manson was cremated. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, his body was not unwanted. Though it was unclaimed for a while, it was eventually claimed by his next of kin and not left abandoned."
