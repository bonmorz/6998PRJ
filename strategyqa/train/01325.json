On average, Eastern chipmunks have a lifespan of 2-3 years in the wild. \n\nSecondly, we need to understand what is meant by \"two leap years.\" Leap years occur every 4 years and have an extra day (February 29). Therefore, two leap years would be 8 years.\n\nNow, we can put these two pieces of information together. If Eastern chipmunks have a lifespan of 2-3 years, then it is very likely that they will die before seeing two leap years (8 years). Even if a chipmunk lived for 3 years, it would still only see one leap year (4 years). Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, an Eastern chipmunk is likely to die before seeing two leap years."

Leap years occur once every 4 years. \n\nNow, let's apply this information to the question. If an Eastern chipmunk lives for an average of 3 years, and a leap year occurs once every 4 years, then it is highly unlikely for an Eastern chipmunk to live long enough to see two leap years. \n\nTo see two leap years, an Eastern chipmunk would need to live for at least 8 years (two sets of 4 years to see each leap year).
