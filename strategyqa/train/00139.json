The speed of sound varies depending on factors such as air temperature and altitude, but at sea level and standard temperature, it\u2019s around 767 miles per hour (1,235 kilometers per hour). The Audi R8 V-10 Plus has a top speed of 205 miles per hour (330 kilometers per hour). \n\nSo, the Audi R8 V-10 Plus cannot break the sound barrier because its top speed is significantly lower than the speed of sound.

Therefore, they move through air, which is a medium that has a specific speed of sound, as mentioned above.\n\nNow, the top speed of an Audi R8 V-10 Plus is around 205 miles per hour (330 kilometers per hour). This speed is much slower than the speed of sound in air, which is 760 miles per hour, as stated earlier.\n\nTherefore, we can say that the sound barrier is too much for the Audi R8 V-10 Plus to break.

The Audi R8 V-10 Plus is a high-performance sports car produced by the German automaker Audi.
