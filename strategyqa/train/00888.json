Alliteration is the repetition of the initial sounds of nearby words. \n\nSecond, we need to understand the phrase \"Lorem ipsum backwards.\" This refers to the practice of taking the Latin text commonly used as filler in graphic design (Lorem ipsum) and reversing it. \n\nNow, if we reverse \"Lorem ipsum,\" the resulting phrase would be \"muspi merol.\" \n\nTo determine if this phrase fails to demonstrate alliteration, we need to analyze whether any nearby words have repeating initial sounds. \n\nIn \"muspi merol,\" we can identify the repeating sounds of \"m\" and \"p.\" The initial sounds of nearby words are \"mu-\" and \"mer-,\" \"sp\" and \"pi,\" and \"ro\" and \"mus-.\" These all exhibit alliteration, and therefore, the answer is (B) no."
