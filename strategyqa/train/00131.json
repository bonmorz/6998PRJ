This podcast is known for reviewing and critiquing poorly-made or controversial religious movies from a skeptical, atheist perspective. The hosts of the podcast often use humor, sarcasm, and pointed criticism to discuss the movies and their themes. \n\nBased on these facts, we can infer that it is unlikely that a deacon would be a fan of 'God Awful Movies.' This is because the podcast is essentially critiquing and mocking the very religious themes and messages that are often important to deacons, and is doing so from a perspective that is fundamentally opposed to their beliefs. Additionally, the tone and humor of the podcast may be seen as disrespectful or irreverent by someone in a religious leadership role like a deacon. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no - a deacon would not be likely to be a fan of the podcast 'God Awful Movies.'"
