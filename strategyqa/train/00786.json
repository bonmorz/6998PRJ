It consists of ideographic characters borrowed from Chinese.\n\nNow, answering the question - a person who knows only English would not be able to read Kanji. This is because Kanji characters represent meanings and ideas, and not sounds like English letters. \n\nTo read Kanji, one would need to have knowledge of the characters and their meanings, which are not taught in English education. One would need to learn the Japanese language and study Kanji separately to acquire the ability to read and understand it."

Each Kanji character represents a word or concept, and there are thousands of Kanji characters. \n\nNext, we need to consider whether knowledge of the English language would enable someone to read Kanji. Since Kanji uses Chinese characters, which have different meanings and pronunciations than English letters, a person who only knows English would not be able to read Kanji. Thus, the answer to the question is (B) no, a person who only knows English cannot read Kanji. \n\nThis is because Kanji is a form of logography which employs symbols rather than sounds or letters. It's entirely different from English, which is an alphabet-based language. So even if someone knows how to read and write English, it doesn't guarantee that they can read Kanji."

These characters are derived from Chinese characters and are primarily used in the Japanese language to represent words or parts of words.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: \"Can a person who knows only English read Kanji?\" The answer to this question is no. The reason being that Kanji is not an alphabet-based writing system like English. In English, we use letters to create words, but in Kanji, each character represents a word or part of a word. Therefore, without knowledge of the characters and their meanings, an English-only speaker cannot read Kanji.\n\nIt is important to note that learning Kanji is not impossible for English-only speakers, but it requires a significant amount of time and effort. To learn Kanji, one must study and memorize each character and its meaning. This is why most non-native speakers of Japanese, even those who know the language, struggle with reading and writing in Kanji."
