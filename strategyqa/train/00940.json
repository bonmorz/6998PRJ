It is possible that some members of Blue Lives Matter may enjoy playing the game for entertainment purposes, but it is unlikely that they support every element of it."

It is unlikely that members of Blue Lives Matter would support every element of Grand Theft Auto III. Although they support law enforcement, they also support the laws that officers are expected to enforce. Engaging in criminal activities, even in a video game, goes against the principles of the movement.
