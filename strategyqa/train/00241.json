Moore to see if he has contributed significantly to human spaceflight missions.\n\nAfter doing a quick search, we find that Jesse W. Moore was an American physicist who primarily worked on plasma physics and fusion energy. While he did work with NASA and was involved in the design of the Space Shuttle, there is no indication that he contributed significantly to the safety and success of human spaceflight missions, which is the criteria for the Snoopy-themed award.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, Jesse W.
