To find the answer, we can conduct research on historical and cultural beliefs about celery. This can be done by reading literature, articles or consulting experts in the field. \n\nAfter conducting research, we find that ancient Greeks believed that celery grew from the blood of Adonis, a god of vegetation, who was killed by a wild boar.
