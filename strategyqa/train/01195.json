Instead, it is bordered by city streets and neighborhoods on all sides. However, since the question does not specify that the island must completely surround the zoo, it is still correct to answer \"yes\" that Central Park Zoo is located on an island. \n\nStep 4: Select the correct answer.\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is (A) yes."
