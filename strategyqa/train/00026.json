The answer is (A) yes, it is enough. \n\nThis is because Bunco can be played with a minimum of 12 people, which is exactly the number of people in a felony jury. However, it is important to note that if any member of the jury is a part of the trial, they would not be able to participate in the game as they have a legal obligation to remain impartial and focused on the case."
