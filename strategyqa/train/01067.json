None of these letters can be typed using only the keys in the top row of the keyboard. The letter \"C\" needs the \"Ctrl\" key, the letter \"O\" needs the \"Shift\" key, the letter \"U\" needs the \"Shift\" key, the letter \"R\" needs the \"Shift\" key, the letter \"G\" needs the \"Alt\" key, the letter \"E\" needs the \"Shift\" key, the letter \"T\" needs the \"Shift\" key, and the second \"E\" needs the \"Shift\" key.\n\nTherefore, we can say that the original name of zucchini, i.e., \"courgette,\" cannot be typed on the top row of a QWERTY keyboard.
