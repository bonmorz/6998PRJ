Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that our body needs to keep our immune system functioning properly, maintain the health of our skin, bones and connective tissues, and help our bodies absorb iron from our food. \n\nSecondly, we need to know what lemonade is made of. Lemonade is a drink made from lemon juice, water, and sugar or sweeteners. Lemons are known to be a rich source of Vitamin C. \n\nFinally, we can put these two pieces of information together to answer the question. If we drink a glass of lemonade made from fresh lemons, there will be Vitamin C in the juice, and therefore, drinking a glass of lemonade can provide some amount of Vitamin C to our bodies. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

It is also an antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage caused by free radicals.\n\nNext, we need to identify the source of Vitamin C. Citrus fruits, such as lemons, limes, oranges, and grapefruits, are well-known sources of Vitamin C. In fact, a single medium-sized lemon contains about 30-40 mg of Vitamin C.\n\nFinally, we need to determine if drinking a glass of lemonade would provide Vitamin C. The answer is yes. Lemonade is typically made with lemon juice, which contains Vitamin C. Depending on the recipe and how much lemon juice is used, a glass of lemonade may provide a significant amount of Vitamin C.\n\nIn summary, drinking a glass of lemonade would provide Vitamin C, which is why the answer is (A) yes."

Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a vital role in maintaining and helping the body\u2019s tissues to function properly. \n\nNext, we need to know if lemons contain Vitamin C. Yes, lemons are a good source of Vitamin C. Specifically, one medium-sized lemon contains approximately 30-40 mg of Vitamin C. \n\nFinally, we need to determine if drinking a glass of lemonade, which is made from lemons, would provide Vitamin C. The answer is yes. When making lemonade, lemon juice (which contains Vitamin C) is squeezed into water, mixed with sugar, and then consumed. Therefore, drinking a glass of lemonade would provide Vitamin C to the consumer."

Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes. Drinking a glass of lemonade will provide you with a significant amount of Vitamin C that can boost your immune system and help you fight off common colds and infections. However, it is essential to keep in mind that store-bought lemonade with added sugar may not be the best option if you are looking for a healthy source of Vitamin C. Therefore, making your own lemonade at home with fresh lemons and sweeteners like honey or stevia can be a healthier alternative. Overall, drinking a glass of lemonade is a great way to add Vitamin C to your diet while enjoying a refreshing and delicious drink."
