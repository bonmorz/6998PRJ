This could mean different things, but in this case, it likely means who has had the most successful and acclaimed acting career within Julia Roberts' family. \n\nNext, we need to identify who else is in Julia Roberts' family and has pursued acting. Her siblings, Eric Roberts and Lisa Roberts Gillan, also have acting careers. However, it is widely recognized that Julia Roberts has had the most successful and acclaimed career out of her siblings. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes, because Julia Roberts does lose the prolific acting contest in her family to herself.

We can use the word \"lose\" to mean that someone has failed to win or has been defeated, so if Julia Roberts has lost the contest, that means she has not been the most successful actor in her family. \n\nBased on available information and the opinions of critics and fans, it is widely believed that Julia Roberts has indeed lost the prolific acting contest in her family. Her siblings, Eric Roberts and Lisa Roberts Gillan, have both had successful acting careers, and her niece, Emma Roberts, is also a successful actor. While Julia Roberts is certainly a highly-accomplished actor in her own right, it appears that she has not been as successful as some of her family members. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

To answer this, we need to consider the other members of her family who are also actors. Julia's brother, Eric Roberts, is also an actor, as well as her niece, Emma Roberts, and her daughter, Hazel Moder, who has appeared in a small role in the film Mother's Day.\n\nOut of these family members, Eric Roberts has a longer acting career than Julia (with over 500 acting credits compared to Julia's 70+). Emma Roberts has also acted in numerous films and TV shows, and is currently active in Hollywood. While Hazel Moder has only appeared in one film so far, it is possible that she may pursue an acting career in the future.\n\nBased on this information, it can be concluded that Julia Roberts may lose the prolific acting contest in her family due to the number of family members who have substantial acting careers. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

Moreover, Eric Roberts has been nominated for multiple awards and won several, including a Golden Globe, while Julia Roberts has been nominated and won even more, including an Academy Award and multiple Golden Globes.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Julia Roberts loses the prolific acting contest in her family, as her brother Eric Roberts has more acting credits and awards than her.
