He is known for developing a system for naming, classifying, and organizing living things, which became known as the Linnaean system.\n\nNext, we need to know where Carl Linnaeus was buried. Carl Linnaeus was buried in an old churchyard in Uppsala, Sweden. His grave is marked with a simple stone marker that reads \"Carolus Linnaeus.\"\n\nNow, we need to know where Michael Jackson was buried. Michael Jackson, the famous pop singer, was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.\n\nBased on this information, we can determine that Carl Linnaeus and Michael Jackson do not share the same final resting place. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no."
