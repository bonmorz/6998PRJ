Their individual stories and myths also differ, with Hermes known for stealing cattle as a baby and being a messenger of the gods, while Vulcan was married to Venus and known for creating weapons for the gods. \n\nTherefore, it is incorrect to say that Hermes and Vulcan are equivalent, and the correct answer to this question is (B) no."

Hermes is typically depicted with a winged hat and sandals, while Vulcan is often shown with a hammer and tongs. The distinguishing qualities in their appearance further support the fact that they are not equivalent.\n\nOverall, based on a comparison of their domains and associated symbolism, it can be inferred that Hermes and Vulcan are not equivalent, and the correct answer is B) no."

We can see that Hermes and Vulcan have very different roles and domains in their respective pantheons. Therefore, they are not equivalent. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no."
