These qualifications are laid out in Article II, Section 1 of the United States Constitution. One of these qualifications is that the person must be a natural-born citizen of the United States.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger was not born in the United States, but rather in Austria. Therefore, under this qualification, he would be unable to run for President of the United States. This is why the answer to the question is (A) - yes, he would be unable to run for President of the US."

Schwarzenegger was born in Austria, not the US, which means he is not a natural-born citizen of the US. Even though he became a US citizen in 1983, he is not eligible to run for President because he was not born in the US. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, he would be unable to run for President of the US."
