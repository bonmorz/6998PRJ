                "content": "First, we need to understand what the genre of And Then There Were None is. And Then There Were None is a classic mystery novel by Agatha Christie, characterized by a locked-room scenario, the presence of a limited number of suspects, and the gradual elimination of each suspect until the identity of the killer is revealed. This genre is also referred to as a \"whodunit\" or detective novel.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether any of J.K. Rowling's books fit this genre. Rowling is famous for writing the Harry Potter series, which is primarily a fantasy novel with elements of mystery and thriller. Therefore, we can eliminate the possibility of any of the Harry Potter books being in the same genre as And Then There Were None.\n\nHowever, Rowling has also written other novels outside of the Harry Potter series. One such book is The Cuckoo's Calling, which is a mystery novel featuring a private detective, Cormoran Strike. The plot of this book revolves around the investigation of a murdered supermodel and the gradual elimination of suspects until the killer is revealed. It follows the same \"whodunit\" genre as And Then There Were None.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes, one of J.K. Rowling's books, The Cuckoo's Calling, falls within the same genre as And Then There Were None."
