She has released numerous hit songs and has won many awards for her music. Gospel music, on the other hand, is a genre of Christian music that is characterized by its lyrics, which are usually based on biblical scriptures.\n\nNow, if we go back to the question, it is asking if most fans follow Katy Perry for gospel music. The answer is no. This is because Katy Perry is primarily known for her pop music, which is vastly different from gospel music. While some of her songs may have religious themes or undertones, they are not considered gospel music.\n\nFurthermore, if we look at the demographic of Katy Perry's fans, they are mostly young adults and teenagers who enjoy pop music. This also indicates that they are not necessarily looking for gospel music when they listen to Katy Perry's music.\n\nIn conclusion, we can say that most fans do not follow Katy Perry for gospel music. This is because she is not primarily known for this genre of music and her fans listen to her for her pop music."
