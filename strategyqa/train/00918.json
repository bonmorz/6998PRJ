These 144,000 individuals are said to be chosen by God from among Jehovah's Witnesses since the time of Jesus' death and resurrection. They believe that the rest of humanity will be resurrected on a paradise earth and will live forever in a peaceful and perfect world.\n\nNow, let's come back to the question. It asks if every resident of Los Angeles County, California will go to Jehovah Witnesses' heaven. As per Jehovah's Witness teachings, only 144,000 individuals will go to heaven, and they will be selected by Jehovah God. There is no connection between one's residence and their selection to go to heaven, as it is up to God's choice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option (B), no, every resident of Los Angeles County, California will not go to Jehovah Witnesses' heaven. Only a select group of people chosen by God will be granted entry to heaven according to their beliefs."

According to their teachings, only a select group of 144,000 people will go to heaven and rule with Jesus Christ as kings and priests. They believe that these individuals have been chosen by God throughout history and that the number has been gradually filling up since the time of Jesus.\n\nNow, Los Angeles County has a population of around 10 million people. It is impossible for all of them to be included in the exclusive group of 144,000 chosen ones. Therefore, the answer is no, every resident of Los Angeles County, California will not go to Jehovah Witnesses's heaven.\n\nIt is important to note that Jehovah Witnesses believe that the vast majority of people who do not go to heaven will be resurrected on earth after the end of the world, and they will have the opportunity to receive eternal life in a paradise-like state."
