In the case of US 2018 GDP, the number is in billions of dollars. Therefore, we need to use at least three commas to correctly display the number.\n\nTo verify this, we can calculate the US 2018 GDP and see how many digits it has. According to the World Bank, the US 2018 GDP was $20.58 trillion. If we divide this number by 1 billion, we get 20.58. This means that the US 2018 GDP has four digits before the decimal point and none after it.\n\nTo correctly display such a number, we need to use commas. One comma would separate the thousands, two commas would separate the millions, and three commas would separate the billions. Therefore, we need to use three commas to correctly display the US 2018 GDP.\n\nIf we use only two commas, the number would be displayed as 20,579.99, which is incorrect because it implies that the US GDP is in millions, not billions. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, three commas are not sufficient for displaying US 2018 GDP."

Specifically, commas are used to separate groups of three digits to help readers distinguish between different place values. \n\nIn the case of US 2018 GDP, the value is over $20 trillion. Therefore, using only three commas would mean grouping the digits in amounts of three, so the resulting value would be displayed as \"20,000,000,000.\" \n\nHowever, this format can be confusing and difficult to interpret, especially given the large value of US GDP. It's more common to use additional commas to separate digit groups further. \n\nFor example, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis displays the 2018 GDP as \"20,494,100,000,000.\" This format makes it more clear where different place values are in the number, as well as making it easier to compare the GDP to other values with many digits.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, three commas are not sufficient for displaying US 2018 GDP."

According to the World Bank, the US GDP for 2018 was approximately $20.58 trillion. This is a very large number, and without proper formatting, it may be difficult to read or understand.\n\nNow, let's consider the potential impact of using three commas to display this number. Placing commas after every three digits would result in the number being divided into three groups: 20,580,000,000,000. While this may seem sufficient, it's important to note that large numbers can be difficult to read and comprehend without proper formatting.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that three commas would not be sufficient for displaying US 2018 GDP, and the correct answer is (B) no. A more effective and commonly used method would be to use both commas and periods to format the number, such as: $20,580.00 billion. This would make the number more visually appealing and easier to read for the audience."

For example, $1,234,567 is one million two hundred and thirty-four thousand five hundred and sixty-seven.\n\nNow, let's apply the rule to US 2018 GDP. Starting from the right, we have 8 digits.
