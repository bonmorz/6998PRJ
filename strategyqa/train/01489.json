To make parma ham, the pig must undergo a lengthy curing process that usually takes anywhere from 9 to 18 months. \n\nIf the pig is slaughtered in December, this means that the curing process would not be complete until at least September of the following year. Therefore, the parma ham would not be ready for New Year's which is in January of the following year. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no.

To make parma ham, the leg is first cleaned and then covered with a mixture of sea salt, which helps to draw out the moisture, and a few other ingredients. \n\nNext, the leg is left to cure for a period of time that can range anywhere from 12 to 36 months, depending on the producer and the desired flavor. During this time, the ham is hung to dry in a cool, dark place, where it slowly loses moisture and gains flavor.\n\nSo, to answer the question, if the pig is slaughtered in December, there is simply not enough time for the leg to be cured and ready for New Year's. Even the shortest curing time for parma ham is 12 months, and that would mean the ham wouldn't be ready until the following December.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

The process of making parma ham involves salting the meat, then air-drying it for a period of up to 24 months.\n\nNow, let's consider the question. If the pig is slaughtered in December, will the parma ham be ready for New Year's? The answer is no. The reason for this is that the curing process for parma ham takes a long time - up to 24 months, as we mentioned earlier. If the pig is slaughtered in December, the meat will need to be salted and then air-dried for at least a year before it is ready to be made into parma ham. Therefore, the parma ham will not be ready for New Year's, which is only a few days after the pig is slaughtered.\n\nIn summary, while the pig may be slaughtered in December, the parma ham will not be ready for New Year's because it takes a minimum of one year to cure. The correct answer is (B) no."
