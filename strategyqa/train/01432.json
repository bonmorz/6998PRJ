As such, they wouldn't have been contemporaries, and it's highly unlikely that King Arthur would have been present at Anne Boleyn's beheading.\n\nAdditionally, there is no historical evidence to suggest that King Arthur was present at the execution of Anne Boleyn.

King Arthur is a legendary British leader who is believed to have lived in the late 5th or early 6th century. He is often associated with the legend of the Knights of the Round Table and the sword in the stone.\n\nOn the other hand, Anne Boleyn was the second wife of King Henry VIII of England, who reigned from 1509 to 1547. Anne Boleyn was executed on May 19, 1536, on charges of adultery, incest, and treason.\n\nGiven these historical facts, we can conclude that King Arthur lived centuries before Anne Boleyn's time and could not have been present at her beheading. This means that the correct answer is (B) no.\n\nIt's worth noting that there is no evidence to suggest that King Arthur ever existed as a real historical figure. Instead, he is believed to be a composite of various historical and mythical figures, created over time in British folklore and literature."

So it seems unlikely that King Arthur could have been at her beheading, which took place in 1536.\n\nFurther, there is no historical evidence to suggest that King Arthur ever visited England during the Tudor era, let alone that he witnessed Anne Boleyn's execution.

There is no reason to believe that King Arthur was present at the beheading of Anne Boleyn, as the two lived centuries apart and there is no evidence of any connection between them."
