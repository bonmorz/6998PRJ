In this case, it is not specified, so we have to consider different possibilities. \n\nOne option is a furniture store, such as Ikea. Another option is a grocery store, such as Walmart or Target. \n\nIf we consider Ikea, we know that they sell furniture and also have a cafeteria where they serve Swedish meatballs. So, in this case, the answer would be yes, you can buy furniture and meatballs in the same store. \n\nIf we consider a grocery store like Walmart or Target, they sell furniture, but typically do not have a cafeteria or restaurant within the store where they serve meatballs. However, some grocery stores may have a frozen food section where they sell pre-packaged meatballs, which would still technically mean you can buy both furniture and meatballs in the same store. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, because there are stores that sell both furniture and meatballs."

The two items mentioned are furniture and meatballs. \nStep 2: Think of a store that is well known for selling furniture and Swedish meatballs. The most well-known store that sells these two items is IKEA. \nStep 3: Verify whether IKEA actually sells both furniture and meatballs. Upon visiting IKEA's website, we can see that they have a restaurant section that serves Swedish meatballs, and a furniture section that sells various types of furniture. Therefore, it is possible to buy furniture and meatballs in the same store. \nStep 4: Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the answer is (A) yes."
