Thus, if Heracles' famous labors exceeded a baker's dozen, it would mean he completed more than 13 labors.\n\nHowever, according to Greek mythology and the stories surrounding Heracles, he only completed a total of 12 labors. These included tasks such as slaying the Nemean lion, capturing the Erymanthian boar, and cleaning the Augean stables.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no - Heracles' famous labors did not exceed a baker's dozen."

A baker's dozen is 13, instead of the usual 12, because historically bakers wanted to ensure that customers received the full weight of goods they purchased, despite potential variations. \n\nNow, let's focus on the context of the question. The question is asking whether Heracles has completed more than 13 famous labors. This is a straightforward count. According to Greek mythology, Heracles completed a total of 12 famous labors, not more than 13, which is a baker's dozen. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

Heracles is known for performing 12 labors, which were assigned to him as punishment for killing his wife and children. These labors were extremely difficult tasks, such as killing the Hydra, cleaning the Augean stables, and capturing the Cerberus.\n\nSince the question asks if Heracles performed more than 13 tasks, we can eliminate option A (yes) as it suggests that he did more than 13 tasks. We know, however, he only performed 12 labors, as per Greek mythology.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Heracles did not perform more than a baker's dozen (13) tasks."
