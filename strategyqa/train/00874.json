On the other hand, Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States who lived from 1809-1865. \n\nBased on their birth and death dates, it is clear that Lionel Richie could not have possibly met Abraham Lincoln in person.

As a result, the answer is (B) no - Lionel Richie never had dinner with Abraham Lincoln."

However, there's no such record or any credible source that suggests that Lionel Richie and Abraham Lincoln had ever met.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently say that the answer to this question is (B) no, Lionel Richie never had dinner with Abraham Lincoln."
