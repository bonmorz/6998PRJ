However, let's assume that this question is trying to ask whether Linus Torvalds' wife is physically incapable of defending herself.\n\nThe answer to this question is (B) no. This is because there is no information provided that would suggest that Linus Torvalds' wife is unable to physically defend herself. In fact, it is unfair and inappropriate to make assumptions about someone's physical abilities based on their gender or any other personal characteristic such as being married to someone famous.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
