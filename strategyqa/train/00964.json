The Pulitzer Prize is a prestigious award in the United States given for achievements in journalism, literature, and musical composition. \n\nNow, let's consider who Cheb Mami is. Cheb Mami is an Algerian musician who is known for his Rai music. Rai music is a style of music that originated in Algeria and is characterized by its fusion of traditional and modern music styles. \n\nSo, can Cheb Mami win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition? The answer is no. This is because the Pulitzer Prize only recognizes American citizens, permanent residents, or those who work primarily in the United States. As Cheb Mami is not an American citizen or permanent resident and does not primarily work in the United States, he is ineligible to win the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, it is impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition."

Therefore, it is unlikely that Cheb Mami would be able to create a work that would be eligible for the Pulitzer Prize for Musical Composition, making answer (A) correct."

The question asks if it is impossible for him to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. The answer is yes, it is impossible.\n\nThe reason being, the Pulitzer Prize for music specifically recognizes classical or jazz compositions of significant and substantial nature. Since Cheb Mami's music falls under the World Music genre, which is not eligible for the award, he cannot win the Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. Thus, the answer is (A) yes."

So, getting a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition means that the composer has created a masterpiece deserving of recognition in the musical world.\n\nNow, let's focus on Cheb Mami. Cheb Mami is an Algerian Rai singer who became popular in Europe during the 1990s. He is known for blending traditional Arabic music with Western pop music. However, he has never been recognized for his musical compositions, which are mainly focused on lyrics and vocal performance. Even if he were to write a piece of music, it is unlikely that it would be considered groundbreaking enough to win a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nFurthermore, the Pulitzer Prize is typically only awarded to American citizens or those who have strong ties to the United States. As Cheb Mami is not an American citizen nor has any significant ties to the United States, he would not be eligible for consideration.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Yes, it is impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition."

Pulitzer Prize winners in music have historically been awarded for classical and jazz compositions. \n\nThirdly, Cheb Mami has not been recognized for any significant contributions to music by American institutions or organizations, nor has he received any notable accolades from non-American organizations for musical composition. The Pulitzer Prize often recognizes artists who have received recognition and acclaim from their field and peers. \n\nTherefore, based on these factors, it is highly unlikely, if not impossible, for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition."
