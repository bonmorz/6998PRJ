Next, we know that the Formula One championship is a title awarded to the driver who earns the most points during a season of Formula One racing. Secretariat was not a Formula One driver and never competed in any Formula One races. Therefore, we can conclude that Secretariat did not win a Formula One championship, making option B the correct answer."

It is a highly competitive and popular form of racing that has been around since the 1950s. However, Secretariat was only ever involved in horse racing and did not participate in any other types of racing.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, Secretariat did not win a Formula One championship."
