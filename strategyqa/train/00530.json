Second, consider the physical activity involved in picking strawberries. It requires bending over, squatting, and reaching to pick the berries from the ground. These motions put a strain on the back muscles and can aggravate back pain. Therefore, someone with back pain is likely to experience discomfort or pain while picking strawberries. As a result, the answer to the question is (B) no."

This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as strains or sprains, herniated disks, or spinal stenosis. \n\nNext, we need to think about the physical activity involved in picking strawberries. Picking strawberries requires a person to bend down repeatedly to reach the low-hanging fruit, potentially putting strain on the lower back. It also involves standing for extended periods of time, which may exacerbate existing back pain. \n\nConsidering these two factors, it is likely that someone with back pain would not enjoy picking strawberries. The physical activity involved in the task may worsen their symptoms and cause additional pain or discomfort. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
