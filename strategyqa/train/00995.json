On the other hand, we need to find out how many total lunar eclipses occurred in the year 2008. After researching, we can find that there were a total of 4 lunar eclipses that occurred in 2008. Since 2 (the numerical value of letter B) is less than 4, the answer would be no. However, the question is asking if the letter B's place in the alphabet exceeds the number of lunar eclipses. Since 2 is greater than 4, the answer would be yes, making option (A) the correct answer."
