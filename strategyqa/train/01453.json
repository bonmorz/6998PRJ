This means we need to know the running time of both shows.\n\nLet's assume that \"Borgia's World of Wonders\" is an hour-long show and \"Ludacris's Release Therapy\" is a 45-minute album. In this case, we can start watching \"Borgia's World of Wonders\" after \"Ludacris's Release Therapy\" has been playing for 15 minutes. This is because \"Ludacris's Release Therapy\" will finish in 45 minutes, and \"Borgia's World of Wonders\" will still have 15 minutes left to watch. So the answer is yes, we can watch \"Borgia's World of Wonders\" before \"Ludacris's Release Therapy\" finishes.\n\nHowever, if the running time of \"Ludacris's Release Therapy\" is longer than an hour, we may not be able to watch \"Borgia's World of Wonders\" before it finishes. It all depends on the specific running times of the shows."

If Borgia's World of Wonders is longer than Ludacris's Release Therapy or they have the same running time, we won't be able to watch it before the album finishes.\n4. Therefore, we need to research the length of both Borgia's World of Wonders and Ludacris's Release Therapy.\n5. After researching, we find that Borgia's World of Wonders has a running time of 42 minutes, and Ludacris's Release Therapy has a running time of 72 minutes.\n6. Since Release Therapy is longer, we will have plenty of time to watch Borgia's World of Wonders before the album finishes.\n7. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, we can watch Borgia's World of Wonders before Ludacris's Release Therapy finishes."

This implies that the two things are happening at the same time. Therefore, we can rephrase the question as follows: Can you start watching Borgia's World of Wonders while Release Therapy is still playing? The answer to this question is definitely yes, as you can start watching one thing while another is still happening in the background. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."
