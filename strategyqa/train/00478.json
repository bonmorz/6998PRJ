In \"the,\" there is no C at all. In \"and,\" the letter C is not a crucial part of the spelling. It could be replaced with a K or an X and still be pronounced the same way. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, letter C is not crucial to spelling the two most common words in English language."

The word is spelled T-H-E. Therefore, the answer to the question for \"the\" is no, letter C is not crucial. \n\nMoving on to \"and\", we can see that there is a letter C in this word. The word is spelled A-N-D. However, the letter C in \"and\" is not crucial to the spelling of the word. If we were to remove the letter C, we would get \"an\", which is a valid word in English but with a different meaning. Therefore, the answer to the question for \"and\" is also no, letter C is not crucial. \n\nOverall, neither \"the\" nor \"and\" require the letter C, so the answer to the question is (B) no."

We can prove this by replacing the \"C\" with another letter, such as \"K,\" to get \"ank,\" which is not a word in the English language.
