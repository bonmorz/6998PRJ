                "content": "First, we need to determine the yearly precipitation on Snowdon. Snowdon is the highest mountain in Wales and experiences a lot of rainfall. On average, it receives about 4,520mm of precipitation per year.\n\nNext, we need to figure out if this amount of precipitation would be enough to submerge an upright bowling pin. According to the United States Bowling Congress, a regulation bowling pin is 15 inches tall and has a diameter of 4.75 inches.\n\nTo determine if the precipitation would submerge the pin, we need to calculate the volume of the pin and compare it to the volume of precipitation that falls on Snowdon each year. The volume of the pin can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = \u03c0r^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius (half the diameter), and h is the height. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nV = \u03c0(2.375in)^2(15in)\nV = 670.691 cubic inches\n\nNow, let's consider the precipitation. To calculate the volume of precipitation that falls on Snowdon, we need to know the surface area of the mountain and the amount of precipitation that falls per unit area. Snowdon has a surface area of about 16.3 square miles, which is equivalent to 10,432,000 square inches. Dividing the yearly precipitation amount by the surface area, we get:\n\n4,520mm / 10,432,000 sq in = 0.000433 cubic inches per square inch\n\nMultiplying this by the surface area, we get:\n\n0.000433 cu in/sq in x 10,432,000 sq in = 4,520 cubic inches\n\nComparing the volume of the pin to the volume of precipitation, we can see that the precipitation is more than enough to submerge the pin:\n\nVolume of pin = 670.691 cubic inches\nVolume of precipitation = 4,520 cubic inches\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes, the yearly precipitation on Snowdon would submerge an upright bowling pin."

According to the United States Bowling Congress (USBC), the standard size for a bowling pin is 15 inches in height and 4.75 inches in diameter at its widest point.\n\nNow, we can compare the size of a bowling pin to the average yearly precipitation on Snowdon. To do this, we need to convert 2,000-2,500 mm into inches. 1 mm is equal to 0.03937 inches. Therefore, 2,000-2,500 mm is equal to 78.74-98.43 inches.\n\nComparing the height of a bowling pin (15 inches) to the maximum yearly precipitation on Snowdon (98.43 inches), we can see that the precipitation is much larger than the height of the bowling pin.

Since the diameter of the bowling pin is 12.07 cm, the radius is 6.035 cm. The height of the bowling pin is 38.1 cm.
