Dogs have a very strong sense of smell and their nose is capable of detecting scents that are undetectable by humans. \n\nAmmonia has a very strong odor, and it is likely that a dog would easily notice it. This is because dogs have up to 300 million sensory receptors in their noses (compared to 6 million in humans), and they are able to easily identify different scents. Additionally, ammonia has a distinct chemical composition which dogs would be able to pick up on.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, a dog would easily notice ammonia."

A dog's nose has about 300 million olfactory receptors, compared to only about 6 million in a human's nose. These receptors allow them to smell things in much greater detail and from far greater distances than humans can.\n3. Can dogs smell ammonia? Yes, dogs can detect ammonia with their highly sensitive noses. To a dog, the smell of ammonia is quite strong and distinctive.\n4. Would a dog easily notice ammonia? Yes, a dog would very easily notice ammonia due to their highly sensitive sense of smell."

In fact, they have up to 300 million olfactory receptors in their noses, compared to the mere 6 million in our own noses. \n\nNow, let's consider a dog's behavior. Dogs are known for their keen sense of smell, which they use to detect scents that are imperceptible to humans. They are trained to detect various odors such as drugs, explosives, and even certain medical conditions in humans. \n\nBased on these factors, we can conclude that a dog would easily notice the presence of ammonia. The strong odor of ammonia is likely to be extremely noticeable to a dog, and they would be able to detect its presence even in very small quantities. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes - a dog would easily notice ammonia."

Dogs have a sense of smell that is about 1,000 times more sensitive than a human's sense of smell. This means they can detect smells that humans cannot. Additionally, dogs have a wide range of nasal receptors that are specialized to detect different types of chemicals. When ammonia is present, it is likely that a dog would pick up on this smell quite easily. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, a dog would easily notice ammonia."
