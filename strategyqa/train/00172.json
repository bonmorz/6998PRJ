Both mollymawks and albatrosses are pelagic birds, meaning they spend most of their lives out at sea. However, they do have specific breeding grounds on islands and coasts around the world, mostly in the southern hemisphere. \n\nSo, can mollymawks live where albatrosses cannot? The answer is no. Both birds live in similar habitats and have overlapping ranges in the Southern Ocean, although there are some differences in their specific breeding grounds. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

Mollymawks are a group of seabirds that belong to the family of albatrosses, so they are closely related. \n\nNow, let's go back to the question. The question is asking if mollymawks live in places where albatrosses cannot. Since mollymawks belong to the same family as albatrosses, it is unlikely that they would live in places where albatrosses cannot. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no. \n\nIt is important to read the question carefully and pay attention to the details. In this case, knowing the relationship between mollymawks and albatrosses helped us arrive at the correct answer."

Mollymawks are smaller than albatrosses, but they have a similar appearance with long wings and narrow, pointed bills. Albatrosses, on the other hand, are larger and have a distinctive hooked bill.\n\nNext, we need to understand the habitats of these birds. Both mollymawks and albatrosses are pelagic birds, which means that they spend most of their lives at sea, far from land. They breed on remote islands in the Southern Ocean, such as the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, and Antarctica.\n\nSo, can mollymawks live where albatrosses cannot? The answer is no. Since both birds have similar lifestyles and require similar habitats, it is unlikely that one species can survive in an area where the other cannot. They both need access to the ocean and remote island environments to breed successfully. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

To answer this, we need to know the general distribution of both birds. \n\nAlbatrosses are found in many parts of the world's oceans, including the North Pacific, South Pacific, North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. They can also be found in sub-Antarctic and Antarctic regions. \n\nMollymawks, on the other hand, are primarily found in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in sub-Antarctic and Antarctic regions. They can also be found in the South Atlantic and South Pacific oceans, but they are generally less widespread than albatrosses. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that wherever mollymawks live, albatrosses can also live.
