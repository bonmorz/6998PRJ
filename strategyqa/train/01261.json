An urban legend is a type of modern folklore that typically involves a shocking or supernatural story that is passed down through word of mouth or email forwards. So, it's clear that an urban legend is a type of folklore. \n\nNext, let's consider the term \"urban.\" The word \"urban\" refers to a city or town, and so we might assume that an urban legend should always be set in an urban area. \n\nBut this is not necessarily the case. While many urban legends do take place in cities, the term \"urban\" in this context is more about the way the legend spreads and evolves than the specific setting of the story. \n\nSo, to answer the question, no, urban legends do not always have to occur in cities. They can take place in any setting, including rural areas or even online. What matters is that the legend is spread and shared among a community, often through word of mouth or social media."

Urban legends are stories or anecdotes that are told and retold in popular culture, usually with a moral or a lesson. \n\nNow, the name itself suggests that urban legends are connected to cities. However, it doesn't mean that they have to occur only in cities. \n\nTo clarify this, we can break down the term \"urban legend.\" The word \"urban\" refers to cities, while \"legend\" refers to a traditional story that has been passed down through generations. The term \"urban legend\" was coined in the mid-1960s to describe the kinds of stories that were being circulated in cities at the time. \n\nSince then, the term has been used to describe any kind of traditional story or anecdote that is circulated among people, whether they live in cities or rural areas. Therefore, urban legends do not always have to occur in cities. \n\nFurthermore, many urban legends are based on superstitions, fears, and anxieties that are common among people from all walks of life. So, it's entirely possible for an urban legend to originate in a rural area, and then spread to cities, and eventually become a popular story that is told all over the world. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer to the question is (B) no, urban legends do not always have to occur in cities."

An urban legend is a modern myth that is usually passed around by word of mouth and often involves a scary or supernatural story that is believed to be true. \n\nNext, we need to consider the word \"urban.\" \"Urban\" refers to cities or densely populated areas. However, just because the word \"urban\" is used in the term \"urban legend\" does not mean that the story has to take place in a city. \n\nFor example, a popular urban legend is the story of the \"vanishing hitchhiker\" where a hitchhiker is picked up by a driver and later disappears, leaving something behind like a scarf or jacket. This story can occur in a rural area, not necessarily a city. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, urban legends do not always have to occur in cities."
