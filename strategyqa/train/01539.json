Straight edge refers to a subculture of punk rock that emerged in the 1980s, and it is characterized by a commitment to abstain from drugs, alcohol, and promiscuous sex.\n\nJackson Pollock, on the other hand, was a famous American painter who died in 1956, which means that he predates the emergence of the straight edge subculture. Therefore, it is impossible for him to have identified as straight edge since the term did not exist during his lifetime.\n\nIn addition to that, Jackson Pollock was known for his struggles with alcoholism, which is a clear indication that he was not committed to abstaining from drinking. Based on these facts, we can confidently say that Jackson Pollock was not straight edge. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
