In the northern hemisphere, winter occurs from December to February, while in the southern hemisphere, winter occurs from June to August. \n\nNow, since the question isn't specific about which hemisphere we're looking at, we need to refer to a broader context. If we are considering the entire world, then August is a winter month for the southern hemisphere. So, the answer is (A) yes. \n\nAlternatively, if the question was specifically asking about the northern hemisphere, then the answer would be (B) no, as August is a summer month in the northern hemisphere."
