In July, temperatures in Hollywood can reach highs of around 85-90\u00b0F (29-32\u00b0C). \n\nNext, we need to consider what type of clothing is appropriate for this climate. In general, people would typically wear lightweight and breathable clothing such as shorts, t-shirts, and sandals to stay cool in the hot weather. \n\nNow, we come to the specific question of whether a coat is necessary in Hollywood in July. Since the climate is hot and dry, it is unlikely that one would need to wear a coat to keep warm. Therefore, the answer is \"yes\", it is normally unnecessary to wear a coat in Hollywood in July."
