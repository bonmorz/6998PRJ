Barack Obama was President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. \n\nBased on this timeline, it is clear that Mitterrand and Obama did not hold the position of President at the same time. Mitterrand's time in office ended well before Obama even began his presidency. Therefore, it is not possible for them to have met while both holding the position of President. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

Even if they had, it would have been highly unlikely that they met officially or formally as both countries have a different political ideology and geopolitical agenda.\n\nHence, the correct answer is B, meaning that Francois Mitterrand did not meet Barack Obama while they both held the position of President."

Francois Mitterrand was the President of France from 1981 to 1995, while Barack Obama was the President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Therefore, there was a significant gap in time between their presidencies. \n\nSecond, we need to consider their locations and roles during their presidencies. Mitterrand was the President of France and primarily focused on domestic and European issues, while Obama was the President of the United States and focused on global issues, particularly in the Middle East and Asia. \n\nThird, we need to examine their diplomatic and political relationships during their respective presidencies. While there were certainly connections between France and the United States during Mitterrand's presidency, there is no evidence or record of a meeting between Mitterrand and Obama during Obama's presidency. \n\nBased on these factors, we can conclude that Francois Mitterrand did not ever meet Barack Obama while they both held the position of President. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
