Based on historical evidence and the popular film Gladiator, we know that he primarily used a sword and shield. \n\nNext, we need to identify Soul Calibur's Faust. In the video game series Soul Calibur, Faust is a character who uses a large, two-handed mace as his primary weapon.\n\nNow that we've identified both weapons, we can answer the question more definitively. Gladiator's sword and shield require one hand for the sword and one hand for the shield, for a total of two hands. In contrast, Soul Calibur's Faust requires both hands to wield, plus potentially a third hand to hold the strap or handle at the end of the mace. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, Gladiator's weapon of choice requires less hands than Soul Calibur's Faust."

In Gladiator, the weapon of choice is typically a sword, which can typically be wielded with one hand, but sometimes requires two hands depending on the size and weight of the sword. \n\nNow, let us look at Soul Calibur's Faust. Faust is a character who uses a unique weapon known as a \"tonfa-style weapon.\" This weapon typically requires two hands to wield. \n\nTherefore, comparing these two weapons, we can conclude that Gladiator's weapon of choice required less hands than Soul Calibur's Faust, leading to the answer of (A)."

Given that Gladiator's weapon is designed to be used with only one hand, it is safe to assume that it requires less hands than Faust's weapon, which likely requires two hands to wield effectively due to its size and complexity.
