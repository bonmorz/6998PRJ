Since then, there have been a total of 17 Chief Justices, including the current Chief Justice, John Roberts.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many seats are on a Boeing 737. The exact number of seats on a Boeing 737 can vary depending on the model and the airline, but typically, a 737 will seat anywhere from 126 to 189 passengers.\n\nIf we assume an average seating capacity of 150 passengers per 737, we can calculate the total number of seats available on a single plane. Multiplying 150 by the number of planes needed to seat all 17 Chief Justices gives us the total number of seats required. In this case, we get 150 x 17 = 2,550 seats required.\n\nSince a Boeing 737 can accommodate at least 126 passengers, it would be possible to fit all 17 Chief Justices in the seats of four Boeing 737s. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, it would not be impossible to seat every Chief Justice of the United States on a Boeing 737."

The seating capacity of a standard Boeing 737 is approximately 130 passengers.\n\nTo determine whether it's possible to seat every Chief Justice on a Boeing 737, we can use simple division. If we divide the number of Chief Justices (17) by the seating capacity of the plane (130), we get:\n\n17 / 130 = 0.13 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nThis means that only 0.13 of the plane's capacity would be needed to seat every Chief Justice. In other words, there would be plenty of seats available.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, it would not be impossible to seat every Chief Justice of the United States on a Boeing 737."
