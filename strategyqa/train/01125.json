The next step is to determine if warthogs can be found in New York City. Warthogs are typically found in Africa, so we may assume that there are no warthogs in New York. However, we cannot be entirely certain, as there may be rare cases where a warthog may be kept in captivity or as a pet. Finally, we may need to do some research or ask around to confirm whether there is indeed a warthog on Broadway. Based on available information and assuming no new information, we can answer this question with choice (B), \"no\". However, if new information is revealed that a warthog is indeed on Broadway, our answer would change to choice (A), \"yes\"."

Another possibility is that there could be a wild warthog roaming the streets of Broadway (although that is certainly less likely!). \n\nGiven that there are a wide variety of performances and exhibits that take place on Broadway, it is indeed possible that there could be a warthog featured in one of these shows.
