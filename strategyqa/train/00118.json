This movie was released in 2016, five years after Winehouse's death. Therefore, it would have been impossible for her to have seen it or expressed a fandom for it. \n\nFinally, we can consider any public statements or actions that Winehouse may have made in the past regarding Star Wars. However, there is no evidence to suggest that she ever expressed an interest in the franchise or its films. \n\nBased on these considerations, the answer to the question is (B) no - Winehouse was not a fan of Star Wars: Rogue One or the Star Wars franchise in general."
