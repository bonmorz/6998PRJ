He has never expressed any interest in running for political office, nor does he have any experience in politics. \n\nSecondly, Mike Pence is currently the Vice President of the United States and his position is not up for grabs in the 2020 election. The position of Vice President is elected every four years along with the President, and the next election for both positions will be in 2024. \n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is no, Justin Bieber will not take over Mike Pence's position in 2020."

Mike Pence is currently the Vice President of the United States, which is a high-ranking political position. For Justin Bieber to take over Mike Pence's position in 2020, he would have to meet several qualifications that are required of a Vice President candidate, such as being a natural-born citizen, being at least 35 years old, and having lived in the US for at least 14 years. Additionally, Justin Bieber has not announced any political campaigns or affiliations with any political parties. It is highly unlikely that Justin Bieber will take over Mike Pence's position in 2020, making answer (B) no, the correct choice."

He has not expressed any interest in running for a political office.\n\nTherefore, it is highly unlikely that Justin Bieber will take over Mike Pence's position in 2020. It is important to note that the Vice President is elected through the process of the United States presidential elections, and there is no connection between the two factors.\n\nThe answer to this question is (B) no. Justin Bieber has no qualifications or interest in being the Vice President of the United States."

The Vice President is elected alongside the President and holds a constitutional position in the government. Justin Bieber, on the other hand, is a popular singer and celebrity. He has not expressed any interest in serving in government or running for political office.\n\nSecondly, unless Mike Pence resigns or is removed from office before the end of his term, his position will not be available to anyone else in 2020. The next presidential and vice presidential election will take place in November 2020, but that is not related to Mike Pence's current position.\n\nTherefore, it is safe to conclude that Justin Bieber will not take over Mike Pence's position in 2020 or any other time, as they are completely unrelated to each other. The correct answer to the question is (B) No."
