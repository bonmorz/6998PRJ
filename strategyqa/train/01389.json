Christopher Nolan is a British film director, producer, and screenwriter, while Danny DeVito is an American actor, producer, and director. They have different body types and live on opposite sides of the Atlantic. \n\nSecondly, borrowing pants from someone requires a certain level of intimacy and familiarity, such as being close friends or family members. We don't have any evidence to suggest that Nolan and DeVito have this kind of relationship. \n\nLastly, even if Nolan did know DeVito well enough to ask to borrow pants, we have to consider whether or not DeVito's pants would fit Nolan. They may not be the same size, style, or cultural norms. \n\nTherefore, based on these considerations, the answer to the question is \"no\" (B). It's not likely that Christopher Nolan could borrow pants from Danny Devito."

Christopher Nolan is a highly acclaimed film director known for movies such as Inception and The Dark Knight trilogy. Danny Devito is an actor known for his roles in movies such as Twins and TV shows like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. \n\nNext, we need to consider the context of the question. The question asks whether Christopher Nolan could borrow pants from Danny Devito. This seems highly unlikely because they likely have different body sizes and styles. \n\nFinally, we need to consider the answer choices. Answer B says \"no\", which is the correct answer based on our previous steps. Christopher Nolan probably couldn't borrow pants from Danny Devito due to their different body sizes and personal styles. \n\nOverall, the correct answer is (B) no."

Christopher Nolan is a famous British-American film director, producer, and screenwriter, known for directing movies like Inception, The Dark Knight Trilogy, and Interstellar. Meanwhile, Danny Devito is a famous American actor, director, and producer, known for his roles in the TV show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and movies like Batman Returns.\n\nNow, let's consider the feasibility of Christopher Nolan borrowing pants from Danny Devito. While there is nothing technically impossible about this scenario, it is highly unlikely. Firstly, Christopher Nolan is a tall man, standing at 5'11\" (180 cm), while Danny Devito is a much shorter man, standing at 4'10\" (147 cm). This means that Danny Devito's pants would likely not fit Christopher Nolan properly, as they would be too short.\n\nFurthermore, it is also unlikely that Christopher Nolan would need to borrow pants from Danny Devito in the first place. As a successful filmmaker, Nolan likely has access to ample resources, including a wardrobe department that could provide him with suitable pants if needed.\n\nTherefore, based on these considerations, the answer is (B) no, Christopher Nolan could not borrow pants from Danny Devito."

This means that Nolan must have some sort of immediate need for pants, such as not having any pants of his own. \n\nAssuming that Nolan and Devito are acquaintances and Nolan does have an urgent need for pants, the next question is whether Devito has pants to lend. However, there is no indication in the question that Devito even has pants available to lend. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, because there is no reason to believe that Nolan can borrow pants from Devito."
