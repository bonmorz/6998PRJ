Barack Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr., was a citizen of Kenya. \n\nNext, we need to determine if Lupita Nyong'o has citizenship in Kenya. Lupita Nyong'o was born in Mexico City, Mexico, to Kenyan parents. Her father, Peter Anyang\u2019 Nyong'o, is a Kenyan politician who has served as a senator of Kisumu County in Kenya. \n\nAccording to Kenyan law, anyone born to at least one Kenyan parent is automatically a citizen of Kenya, regardless of their place of birth. Therefore, Lupita Nyong'o is a citizen of Kenya through her father.\n\nThus, the answer is (A) yes, Lupita Nyong'o has citizenship in paternal family of Barack Obama's origin country."

The question mentions Lupita Nyongo and Barack Obama's paternal family, so we can assume that the countries in question are Kenya (where Obama's father was born) and Mexico (where Nyongo was born).\n\nNext, we need to determine if Nyongo has citizenship in Kenya, which is the country of Barack Obama's paternal family's origin. It is a well-known fact that Nyongo's parents are Kenyan and that she was born in Mexico. However, just because her parents are Kenyan does not automatically mean she has Kenyan citizenship.\n\nFurther research reveals that Nyongo obtained Kenyan citizenship in 2014, following the success of her breakout role in 12 Years a Slave. In an interview with a Kenyan news outlet, she stated that she was \"very, very proud to be Kenyan\" and that she had obtained her Kenyan passport.\n\nWith this information, we can confidently answer the question as (A) yes, Lupita Nyongo does have citizenship in her paternal family's origin country of Kenya."

Therefore, we can conclude that Lupita Nyongo has citizenship in the paternal family origin country of Barack Obama, making the answer (A) yes."

However, she grew up in Kenya and considers herself to be Kenyan-Mexican. So, Lupita Nyongo has citizenship in Mexico and Kenya.\n\nNext, we need to determine the paternal family of Barack Obama's origin country. Barack Obama's father was a Kenyan from the Luo tribe. Therefore, the paternal family of Barack Obama's origin country is Kenya.\n\nFinally, we need to put together the information we have gathered to answer the question. Based on the information above, Lupita Nyongo has citizenship in one of the countries that make up the paternal family of Barack Obama's origin country. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes.
