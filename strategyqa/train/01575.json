Therefore, it is possible that sesame seeds are sprinkled or topped onto hamburger buns.\n4. However, the question asks if sesame seeds are \"glued\" onto hamburger buns.\n5. Gluing involves using an adhesive or sticky substance to attach two things together so that they stick permanently.\n6. There is no evidence or logical reason to suggest that sesame seeds are glued onto hamburger buns.\n7. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

It's possible, but not all hamburger buns have sesame seeds. So, we can't definitively say that they are always there. \n\nNext, we can consider how the sesame seeds would be attached to the bun. Are they mixed into the dough or somehow glued on afterwards? While there may be some creative bakers out there who try different techniques, typically sesame seeds are sprinkled on top of the bun and lightly pressed into the surface. This doesn't involve any glue or adhesive, just gentle pressure. \n\nBased on these observations, we can confidently choose answer (B) no, sesame seeds are not glued onto hamburger buns."

They are often used as a topping on bread, buns, and other baked goods. \n\nNext, we need to consider how sesame seeds are typically added to buns. There are a few ways that sesame seeds can be added to buns, but one common method is to sprinkle them on top of the dough before baking. This creates a delicious and visually appealing topping. \n\nFinally, we need to think about whether any sort of glue is used to attach the sesame seeds to the buns. Based on what we know about the baking process, it's unlikely that any sort of glue would be used. Glue is not an essential ingredient in bread or bun making, and it would not be desirable to add it to the dough. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, sesame seeds are not glued onto hamburger buns."

As such, sesame seeds are not typically glued onto hamburger buns. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, sesame seeds are not glued onto hamburger buns."
