It was not until September 20, 2011 that \"don't ask don't tell\" was officially repealed by the U.S. government. \n\nTherefore, during the time immediately after 9/11, \"don't ask don't tell\" was still in place, making the answer (A) yes."

It was a policy enacted in 1993 that prohibited openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual individuals from serving in the US military. It was controversial and faced criticism for its discriminatory nature.\n\nNext, we need to know when 9/11 happened. It was on September 11, 2001.\n\nFinally, we can put these pieces together to answer the question. The time \"immediately after 9/11\" would refer to the months following the terrorist attacks, likely in late 2001 or early 2002. During this time, DADT was still in place, meaning that openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual individuals could not serve in the military without fear of discharge or punishment. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

The September 11th terrorist attacks occurred in 2001. \"Don't ask don't tell\" was signed into law in 1993 by President Clinton.\n\nSo, was the policy still in place immediately after 9/11? Yes, it was. It wasn't until 2011 that the policy was officially repealed under the Obama administration. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

It doesn't directly relate, but it can be assumed that the aftermath of such a significant event may have led to changes in policies and procedures.\n\n4. When was \"don't ask don't tell\" repealed?

While the policy was still in place in 2001, President Barack Obama eventually signed a bill repealing the policy on December 22nd, 2010.

Immediately after the terrorist attacks, the United States military was heavily involved in military operations in Afghanistan and later Iraq. This means that the time immediately after 9/11 refers to the early 2000s.\n\nAccording to history, the \"don't ask don't tell\" policy remained in place until 2011. This means that during the time immediately after 9/11 (early 2000s), the policy was still in place. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."
