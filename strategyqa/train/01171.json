Allotment refers to the policy in which Native American lands were divided up into individual parcels to be owned by Native individuals. This policy was implemented through the Dawes Act of 1887. \n\nWith this context in mind, the question is asking whether the Cherokee people sent a delegation to oppose this policy. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to gather information about the Cherokee people's stance on allotment and whether they took action to oppose it. One way to do this is to consult historical records, such as documents or accounts from that time period. \n\nResearching this information reveals that the Cherokee people did indeed send a delegation to oppose allotment. The delegation was composed of four men: Thomas J. Morgan, John Q. Tufts, John F. Brown, and John M. Thompson. They traveled to Washington, D.C. in 1888 to express their opposition to the Dawes Act and to argue for the protection of Cherokee lands. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes. The Cherokee people did send a delegation to oppose allotment, as historical records show."

Despite their efforts, the Dawes Act was passed and implemented, resulting in significant losses of Cherokee land and cultural heritage.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Yes, the Cherokee people did send a delegation to oppose allotment."

Why might the Cherokee people oppose allotment? There are several reasons why a Native American tribe might oppose allotment. One reason is that it could result in the fragmentation of tribal land and the loss of traditional communal land practices. Another reason is that it could lead to the loss of tribal sovereignty and cultural identity. \n\n4. Did the Cherokee people send a delegation to Washington, D.C., to oppose allotment? Yes, they did. In fact, several Cherokee leaders, including Chief Charles Thompson, traveled to Washington, D.C., in 1887 to voice their opposition to the Dawes Act, which was the primary piece of legislation that authorized allotment. The Cherokee delegation argued that allotment would result in the loss of Cherokee land and culture and that the tribe should be allowed to maintain its traditional communal land practices."

Many Native Americans opposed allotment because it often resulted in the loss of their traditional lands and cultural practices.\n\nNext, we need to understand who the Cherokee people are.

A delegation is a group of people appointed to represent a larger group or organization.

In fact, the Cherokee Nation did send a delegation to Washington D.C. in 1887 to oppose allotment. The delegation was led by Principal Chief John Ross and included several other prominent Cherokee leaders.

The policy continued and resulted in the forced removal of many Cherokee people from their ancestral lands. \n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes, the Cherokee people did send a delegation to oppose allotment."
