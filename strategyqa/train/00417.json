Kublai Khan was a Mongol emperor who ruled China in the 13th century, while his grandfather was most likely Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol Empire. \n\nThe question is asking whether either of them practiced monogamy, which means being married to only one person at a time. To answer this question, we need to look at historical records and accounts of their marriages and relationships.\n\nIt is well-known that Genghis Khan had many wives and concubines, some estimates as high as 500, and had numerous children with different women. This suggests that he did not practice monogamy. Whether Kublai Khan followed in his grandfather's footsteps is less clear, but given the cultural and societal norms of the time, it is unlikely that he practiced monogamy either.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, neither Kublai Khan nor his grandfather practiced monogamy."
