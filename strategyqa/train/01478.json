Both iron and nickel have a high melting and boiling point. The boiling point of nickel is around 2913 degrees Celsius. \n\nNext, we need to consider the temperature of the outer core. The temperature of the outer core ranges between 4400 to 6100 degrees Celsius. This temperature is well above the boiling point of nickel. \n\nTherefore, based on these facts, we can conclude that nickel would indeed boil in the outer core of the earth.

The boiling point of nickel is 2732 degrees Celsius. \n\nBased on these two pieces of information, we can come to the conclusion that nickel would indeed boil in the outer core of the earth.
