Next, we need to know when Franklin Delano Roosevelt was president. FDR was president from 1933 to 1945. Now, we can calculate whether it is possible for Bill Nye to have voted for FDR. If Bill Nye was born before 1933, then it's possible he could have voted for FDR in one or more of his elections. However, we don't have any information suggesting that Bill Nye was born before 1933. In fact, based on his known age (born in 1955), we can say with certainty that he was not old enough to vote for FDR in any of his four presidential campaigns. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, Bill Nye did not vote for Franklin Delano Roosevelt."
