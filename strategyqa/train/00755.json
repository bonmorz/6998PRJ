Next, it is important to understand that the Marine Corps has strict standards for physical and mental health that all recruits must meet. \n\nNow, let's consider how self-harm might impact a recruit's ability to meet these standards. Depending on the severity and duration of the self-harm behavior, a recruit may be deemed medically unfit for service. This is because self-harm can indicate underlying psychological issues like depression, anxiety, or trauma that can impact a person's ability to function in high-stress environments like the military. In addition, self-harm can result in visible scars or injuries that may not heal properly, making it difficult or impossible to meet physical requirements like running, jumping, or lifting heavy objects.\n\nGiven these factors, it is likely that a recruit for the Marine Corps who has a history of self-harm would be turned away. This decision would ultimately be up to the individual military medical professionals conducting the evaluation, but the strong emphasis on physical and mental fitness in the military would make it difficult for someone with a history of self-harm to meet the necessary standards."
