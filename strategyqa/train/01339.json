Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the phone he used had call waiting. Additionally, call waiting is a feature that must be activated by the phone service provider and is not a default setting on any phone. Since Alexander Graham Bell did not have access to phone service providers that offered call waiting, we can confidently say that the answer is (B) no."
