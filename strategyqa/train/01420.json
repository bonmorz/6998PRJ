The Empire Awards is an annual British awards ceremony honoring cinematic achievements in the local and global film industry. The Best Newcomer category recognizes the most promising young talent in the industry.\n\nNow coming back to the question, we need to consider whether Will Ferrell is eligible for the Best Newcomer category. Will Ferrell has been a prominent figure in the entertainment industry for over three decades, having started his career in the 1990s. As such, he is not a newcomer to the industry and therefore would not be eligible for the Best Newcomer category.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the correct answer to the question would be (A) yes, it would be difficult for Will Ferrell to win Empire Award for Best Newcomer, as he is not eligible for the category."

Will Ferrell, however, is not a newcomer in the industry. He has been acting since 1995 and has been a prominent figure in Hollywood for many years. \n\nSecondly, the Empire Award is presented by Empire magazine which is a British film magazine. Although Will Ferrell has a strong fan base in the UK, he has primarily worked in American films and TV shows. His popularity and impact in the British film industry are not as significant as other actors who are eligible for this award. \n\nConsidering these factors, it would be difficult for Will Ferrell to win the Empire Award for Best Newcomer.
