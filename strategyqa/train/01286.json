A Frigatebird is a type of seabird found in tropical and subtropical regions, known for their large wingspan and ability to soar for long periods of time. \n\nNext, we need to know where Ontario is. Ontario is a province in Canada, located in the central part of the country. \n\nSince Frigatebirds are not native to Ontario and are typically only found in tropical and subtropical regions, it would be very unusual to see one in Ontario. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes, seeing a Frigatebird in Ontario would be a strange sight."

It is a type of seabird that is known for its large wingspan and ability to fly long distances without rest. \n\nNext, we need to assess the distribution of Frigatebirds. Frigatebirds are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, such as the Caribbean, Galapagos Islands, and the coast of West Africa. They are not commonly found in temperate regions like Canada. \n\nTherefore, seeing a Frigatebird in Ontario, which is located in Canada, would be a strange sight as it is outside their typical range. Hence, the correct answer is (A) yes."
