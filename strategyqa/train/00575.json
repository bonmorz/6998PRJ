A horoscope is a prediction of a person's future based on the position of celestial bodies, typically interpreted as an astrological sign or constellation. \n\nNow, let's look at what astronomers do. Astronomers are scientists who study celestial objects and phenomena, such as stars, planets, galaxies, and cosmic radiation. \n\nBased on these definitions and roles, we can conclude that astronomers do not write horoscopes. While both astronomers and astrologers study the stars, their approaches and goals are very different. Astronomers use scientific methods and observations to understand the physical properties and behavior of celestial objects, while astrologers use beliefs and interpretations to make predictions about people's lives based on the positions of these objects. Therefore, astronomers do not write horoscopes, as that is not within their area of expertise or professional responsibility."

Horoscopes are astrological predictions typically based on a person's birth date and the positioning of the stars and planets at that time. \n\nAstronomy, on the other hand, is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena. While astronomy and astrology may seem similar, they are actually quite different. Astronomy is a branch of science that relies heavily on mathematics, observation, and experimentation, while astrology is mostly based on beliefs, traditions, and interpretations.\n\nWith that in mind, the answer to the question is no, astronomers do not typically write horoscopes. While some astronomers may have an interest in astrology, it is not considered a legitimate scientific practice or field of study. \n\nAstronomers focus on gathering and analyzing data about celestial objects and phenomena, such as stars, galaxies, black holes, and planets. They use telescopes, computer simulations, and other tools to study these objects and learn more about their properties, movements, and interactions.\n\nIn summary, horoscopes are not within the purview of astronomy, so it's unlikely that astronomers would be writing them."

They use math and physics to understand the universe and do not focus on interpreting or making predictions based on astrological signs. Therefore, it is safe to say that astronomers do not write horoscopes.\n\nChoice (B) is the correct answer because it accurately reflects this fact.
