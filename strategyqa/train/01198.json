According to IMDB, Hatcher was in a total of 100 episodes of Desperate Housewives and 87 episodes of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. \n\nNext, we need to determine if Hatcher lasted twice as many episodes on Desperate Housewives as she did on Superman. To do this, we can take the number of Desperate Housewives episodes (100) and divide it by two, which gives us 50. If Hatcher had lasted exactly twice as many episodes on Desperate Housewives as she did on Superman, then she would have been in 50 episodes of Superman. However, since she was actually in 87 episodes of Superman, we can see that Hatcher lasted more than twice as many episodes on Desperate Housewives. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

Teri Hatcher appeared on Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, which ran for four seasons from 1993 to 1997. The number of episodes she appeared in is 87 (according to IMDb).\n\nNow, we can compare the number of episodes she appeared in on both shows.
