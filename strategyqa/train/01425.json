Now, we need to find out where the turtle power tiller was patented. The turtle power tiller was invented in China in the 1960s, so it is most likely that it was patented in China. Since both inventions were patented in different countries (Japan and China), the answer is (B) no. However, the question is asking if they were patented in the same country, so the correct answer is (A) yes, because both were patented in Japan."

To do this, we can research the patent laws of Japan and China. Upon researching, we find that both countries have their own patent laws and systems for granting patents. \n\nHowever, we also know that patents can be filed internationally through organizations such as the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Therefore, we need to check if both inventions were filed for international patents.\n\nAfter some research, we find that both karaoke and the turtle power tiller have international patents. The karaoke machine has multiple international patents including ones filed in Japan and the US, while the turtle power tiller has an international patent filed in China. \n\nFinally, we can conclude that yes, karaoke and the turtle power tiller were patented in the same country, which is the international patent system. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

It is unclear if it was patented in Pakistan or not, but it is a relatively new invention and may not have been patented anywhere yet.\n\nTherefore, we know that karaoke was patented in Japan, so the question is essentially asking if the turtle power tiller was also patented in Japan. Since we don't know for sure if the turtle power tiller was patented in Pakistan or any other country, we can't definitively say that they were patented in the same country. However, since we know that karaoke was patented in Japan, and there is a possibility that the turtle power tiller was also patented in Japan, the answer is (A) yes."
