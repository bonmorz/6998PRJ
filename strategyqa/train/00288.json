Worker bees are important for apple growing because they pollinate the flowers, which leads to apple fruit production.\n\nHowever, there are other pollinators besides bees, such as butterflies and flies. Some apple growers even use mechanical methods like vibrating machines to pollinate their apple trees. Therefore, while queen bees may be important for traditional beekeeping and honey production, they are not necessary for growing apples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes. Queen bees are unnecessary for growing apples."

They do not play a direct role in pollinating fruit trees such as apple trees. \n\nPollination is necessary for the production of fruit in apple trees. This process is carried out by bees, including honeybees, which collect pollen from the apple tree flowers and transfer it to other flowers in the process of visiting different plants. Thus, bees are crucial for the growth of apple trees.\n\nHowever, the role of a queen bee is only to produce and maintain a healthy population of honeybees. Apple trees do not require queen bees to grow or produce fruit, only bee pollination. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, queen bees are unnecessary for growing apples."

Worker bees can continue to breed and produce enough offspring to pollinate the apple trees without a queen bee. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, queen bees are unnecessary for growing apples."

Queen bees are responsible for laying eggs, which then hatch into worker bees that pollinate the apple blossoms. Pollination is important for the growth of apples because it allows the transfer of pollen from the male part of the flower to the female part, which enables the fertilization necessary for fruit production.\n\nNow, if we consider whether queen bees are necessary for apple growth, we can eliminate option (B) as a possible answer. This is because if queen bees were necessary for apple growth, then the answer would be \"yes\" (since the question is asking if queen bees are unnecessary). Therefore, the correct answer must be (A).\n\nThere are other insects, such as solitary bees and butterflies, that can also contribute to pollination in apple orchards. However, queen bees are not essential for apple growth, as their role can be fulfilled by other insects. So, we can confidently say that queen bees are unnecessary for growing apples."

Not necessarily. \n\nWhile queen bees play a role in producing the worker bees that pollinate apple trees, there are other pollinators that can do the job as well. These include other types of bees, butterflies, moths, and even birds. \n\nTherefore, based on the fact that there are alternative pollinators, we can confidently say that queen bees are unnecessary for growing apples.

In fact, wild bees or even some species of solitary bees can also effectively pollinate apple trees.\n\nTherefore, based on the above explanation, the correct answer would be (A) yes, queen bees are unnecessary for growing apples."

So, we can say that queen bees are crucial for apple production.\n\nNow, coming to the answer options. Option (A) states that queen bees are unnecessary for growing apples.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (B) no."
