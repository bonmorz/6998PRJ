It is an imaginary line that circles the Earth at 0 degrees latitude, dividing the Earth into the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, anything south of the Equator is in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nNext, we need to identify the location of Cape Town. Cape Town is a city in South Africa, located on the southwest coast of the African continent. We can look at a map or use a search engine to find the coordinates of Cape Town, which are approximately 33.9249\u00b0 S, 18.4241\u00b0 E.\n\nNow, we need to determine if Cape Town is south of the Equator. Looking at the latitude coordinate, we can see that it is indeed south of the Equator, as the latitude number (33.9249) has a negative sign, indicating it is in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, Cape Town is south of the Equator."

So, the question is asking whether Cape Town is located south of this line or not. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to know the latitude of Cape Town. A quick search on a map or online will tell us that Cape Town is located at approximately 33\u00b055\u2032S latitude. \n\nNow, we need to compare this latitude to the Equator. If we think about it, any location with a latitude lower than 0\u00b0 (i.e. in the negative numbers) is south of the Equator, while any location with a latitude higher than 0\u00b0 (i.e. in the positive numbers) is north of the Equator. \n\nTherefore, since Cape Town's latitude is in the negative numbers and lower than 0\u00b0, we can conclude that Cape Town is indeed south of the Equator.
