Chiropractic manipulations are non-invasive interventions that aim to improve joint mobility and function. This is done by applying a controlled force to a joint. \n\nNow, let's move on to the question at hand. Are some chiropractic manipulations dangerous? The answer is yes. While chiropractic manipulations are generally safe, there are potential risks associated with them. Some potential risks include stroke, nerve damage, herniated disks, and fractures. These risks are rare, but they can occur. \n\nIt's important to note that not all chiropractors are created equal. To minimize risks, it's essential to choose a qualified chiropractor who has undergone proper training and certification. Additionally, it's important to be honest with your chiropractor regarding your medical history, current medications, and any underlying health conditions. \n\nIn summary, while chiropractic manipulations can be beneficial, there are potential risks associated with them. It's essential to choose a qualified chiropractor and communicate openly about your medical history to minimize risks."
