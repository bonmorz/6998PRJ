Hilo is a town on the Big Island of Hawaii, which is a tropical destination with warm temperatures year-round. \nTherefore, based on these two pieces of information, we can infer that snowboarding would be a rarity in Hilo. The town does not experience cold temperatures or have snow-covered slopes, which makes it difficult to engage in snowboarding activities. Thus, the answer is (A) yes."

(A) yes implies that snowboarding is rare in Hilo, while (B) no implies that it is not rare.
