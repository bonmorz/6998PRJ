In order to answer this question, we need to consider the current state of knowledge regarding Mars.\n\nAs of now, there has been no definitive evidence found to suggest the existence of any kind of burial mound or tumulus on the planet Mars. In fact, no conclusive evidence of any kind of life has been found on Mars, which makes the discovery of a tumulus even less likely.\n\nScientists and researchers have been studying Mars for several decades and have sent several robotic missions to the planet in order to gather information about its geology, atmosphere, and potential for supporting life. While these missions have yielded valuable information and insights into the planet, no conclusive evidence of any kind of structure like a tumulus has been found.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (B) no, a tumulus has not been discovered on Mars."

Mars is a planet in our solar system and has been studied for many years. Scientists have sent several missions to Mars and have collected a lot of data about its surface features.\n\nSo, has a tumulus been discovered on Mars? No, there has been no evidence found to suggest the existence of a tumulus on Mars. The surface of Mars has been extensively studied using various instruments and cameras, and nothing resembling a tumulus has been detected.\n\nIn addition, the formation of tumuli on Earth is typically associated with human activity or burial rituals. There is currently no evidence of any intelligent life on Mars, nor any civilizations capable of creating structures such as tumuli.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, a tumulus has not been discovered on Mars."
