His name was Vlad III, and he was commonly known as Vlad the Impaler due to his brutal tactics in warfare. \n\nNext, we need to locate where he was from. Dracula was born in the citadel of Sighi\u0219oara in Transylvania, which is a region in Romania but not Bucharest. \n\nLastly, we need to verify whether or not Bucharest is a town. Bucharest is actually the capital city of Romania, not a town. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, historical Dracula was not from a town in Bucharest."
