As of writing, due to ongoing maintenance and restoration work, the bells are not currently being rung on their normal schedule.

Big Ben is actually the nickname for the large bell in the Clock Tower of the Palace of Westminster in London. However, the term is often used to refer to the entire clock tower or the four bells that chime the quarter hours. \n\nNext, we need to consider what is meant by \"normal schedule.\" The bells of Big Ben typically chime every 15 minutes and the great bell strikes every hour. However, there are times when the bells are silenced, such as during maintenance or repair work. \n\nBased on current events and news, we know that the Palace of Westminster is currently closed for renovations and repairs. As a result, it is unlikely that the bells of Big Ben are being rung on their normal schedule. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the bells of Big Ben are likely not currently being rung on their normal schedule at the Palace of Westminster."

Big Ben is a nickname for a bell inside the clock tower of the Palace of Westminster in London, England. \n\nNext, we need to understand what is meant by \"normal schedule.\" This refers to the regular times of day that the bells are rung, which typically occur on the hour and at specific intervals throughout the day. \n\nWith this information in mind, we can answer the question. The answer is (B) no, the bells are not currently rung on their normal schedule at the Palace of Westminster. This is because the tower is currently undergoing renovation work that began in August 2017 and is expected to last until 2021. As a result, the bells have been silenced for much of this time for safety reasons, as the loud chiming could damage the hearing of construction workers in the tower. While there have been occasional instances where the bells have been rung for special events or testing purposes, they are not ringing on their regular schedule."

Big Ben is actually a nickname for the Great Bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London, England. So, the question is asking whether the bells of the clock tower (where the Great Bell is located) are currently rung on their normal schedule.\n\nTo answer the question, we can start by considering why the bells might not be rung on their normal schedule. One possibility could be that the clock tower is undergoing maintenance or repair work, which could temporarily halt bell ringing. Another possibility could be that there is some kind of event or circumstance that has disrupted the normal schedule, such as a national holiday or political event.\n\nWith that in mind, we can look for information about the current status of the bells. One way to do this would be to check the official website for the Palace of Westminster, which is the location of the clock tower. Another option could be to search for news articles or social media posts about the bells.\n\nBased on the information we find, we can determine whether the answer is yes or no. In this case, the answer is B - no. Currently, the bells are not being rung on their normal schedule due to ongoing repair work on the clock tower. This work is expected to continue until 2022, which means that the bells will be silent for some time."
