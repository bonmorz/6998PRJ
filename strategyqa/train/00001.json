These dishes are not suitable for vegans, as they involve animal products.\n\nWhile there may be some vegan options available in Hawaii, it's likely that they will be fairly limited compared to other destinations. This is because the cultural and culinary traditions of Hawaii heavily feature animal products, and it may be difficult to find alternatives that are both authentic and vegan-friendly.\n\nThat said, it's not impossible to enjoy vegan food in Hawaii - it just requires some research and planning. There are some excellent vegan restaurants and cafes in popular destinations like Honolulu, and many traditional Hawaiian ingredients are plant-based, such as taro, coconut, and breadfruit.\n\nHowever, overall, the cuisine of Hawaii is not necessarily well-suited to veganism, so the correct answer to this question would be (B) no."

This means that many traditional Hawaiian dishes like poke bowls and seafood platters are not vegan-friendly.

Therefore, the answer is (B) no, the cuisine of Hawaii is not suitable for a vegan. However, with some modifications and substitutions, it is possible to enjoy vegan food in Hawaii.
