                "content": "Firstly, we know that Japan is not in the Nordic region, which consists of countries such as Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. Therefore, any person who wants to travel from Japan to a Nordic country needs to cross international borders, which typically requires a passport. \n\nAdditionally, it is important to note that most countries around the world require a passport for international travel. A passport serves as an official identity document that includes information about the holder's nationality and eligibility to travel. Without a passport, a person may not be allowed entry into another country or might face difficulties during their journey.\n\nTherefore, based on these facts, we can determine that someone from Japan would need a passport to travel to a Nordic country, making answer (A) the correct choice."

However, they must present a valid passport upon arrival. \n\nFor Iceland, Japanese citizens are also allowed to enter visa-free for up to 90 days, but they must have a valid passport and proof of sufficient funds to cover their stay.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, someone from Japan needs a passport to go to a Nordic country. While they may not need a visa, a valid passport is always required for international travel."
