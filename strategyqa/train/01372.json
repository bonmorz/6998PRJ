However, if we are referring to the number of theme parks, hotels, and other attractions within the resort, then we can compare those numbers more easily.\n\nNow, when we compare Disneyland Paris to other Disney resorts, we find that it is not the largest in terms of the number of theme parks. Disneyland Paris only has two theme parks: Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park. In contrast, Walt Disney World in Florida has four theme parks: Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom. So right away, we can say that Disneyland Paris is not the largest Disney resort if we are comparing based on the number of theme parks.\n\nWe can also compare based on the number of hotels and attractions within the resort. Once again, Walt Disney World has more of both than Disneyland Paris. Walt Disney World has over 30 resort hotels, while Disneyland Paris has around 8. Walt Disney World also has more attractions and restaurants within its resort overall.\n\nThus, based on all these factors, we can confidently say that Disneyland Paris is not the largest Disney resort, so the answer is (B) no."

According to the official Disney Parks website, Disneyland Paris covers 4,800 acres (1,940 hectares). However, there are other Disney resorts that cover more land, such as Walt Disney World in Florida, which spans over 27,000 acres (11,000 hectares). Therefore, based on this information, we can confidently answer that the answer is (B) no - Disneyland Paris is not the largest Disney resort in terms of land size."

However, other Disney resorts have more theme parks, hotels, and/or visitors. For example, Walt Disney World in Florida has four theme parks, about 30 hotels, and over 52 million visitors per year. Thus, we can confidently answer that Disneyland Paris is not the largest Disney resort."

In fact, Walt Disney World Resort in Florida is the largest Disney resort, spanning over 25,000 acres and featuring four theme parks, two water parks, over 20 hotels, and numerous other entertainment venues.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, Disneyland Paris is not the largest Disney resort."

Some examples of Disney resorts are Walt Disney World in Florida, Disneyland Resort in California, Tokyo Disney Resort, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, and Shanghai Disney Resort. \n\nAccording to data available on the official Disney websites, Walt Disney World is the largest Disney resort in terms of physical area, covering over 25,000 acres. Tokyo Disney Resort is the second largest, covering 500 acres, followed by Disneyland Resort in California (500 acres), Shanghai Disney Resort (963 acres), and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort (310 acres). \n\nBased on this information, we can see that Disneyland Paris is not the largest Disney resort in terms of physical area.

The largest Disney park is actually Disney's Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida, which covers 580 acres (235 hectares) compared to Disneyland Paris's 140 acres (57 hectares). However, if we consider the overall resort, there are other factors to consider.\n\nFor example, the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida has a total land area of over 25,000 acres, while Disneyland Paris has a land area of just over 4,900 acres. Additionally, Disney World has more than 30 hotel options and numerous restaurants and attractions, while Disneyland Paris has seven hotels and a smaller number of dining and attraction options.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Disneyland Paris is not the largest Disney resort overall, as the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida is larger in terms of land area, number of hotels, and attractions."
