However, there are also significant Protestant and non-Christian populations. \n\nNext, the question specifically asks about the Quran, which is a religious text associated with Islam. \n\nGiven these factors, it is unlikely that most religious people in Quebec would refer to the Quran. While there are certainly Muslim communities in Quebec who would reference the Quran, they are not the majority religious group. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, most religious people in Quebec do not refer to the Quran."

The majority of people in Quebec identify as Roman Catholic, followed by Protestantism, and then other minority religions such as Judaism, Hinduism, and Islam.

According to data from the 2011 National Household Survey, the most common religion in Quebec is Catholicism, followed by Islam. However, just because Islam is the second most common religion, it doesn't necessarily mean that most religious people in Quebec refer to the Quran. \n\nNext, we need to understand what is meant by \"refer to the Quran.\" If this means seeking guidance or religious teachings from the Quran, it is unlikely that most religious people in Quebec, even those who practice Islam, would solely refer to the Quran. Most religious individuals likely draw on a variety of sources, such as religious leaders or other texts, in addition to the Quran. \n\nFinally, we do not have any reliable data or studies to support the claim that most religious people in Quebec refer to the Quran. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, most religious people in Quebec do not refer to the Quran."

However, the question specifically mentions Quebec, which is a predominantly Catholic province. Therefore, we can assume that the question is referring to the Muslim population in Quebec.\n\nNext, we need to consider whether the Quran is considered the holy book for Muslims. The answer is yes - the Quran is the central religious text of Islam and considered the word of God. However, this does not necessarily mean that most religious people in Quebec refer to it.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to look at the demographics of the Muslim population in Quebec. According to a 2011 survey, Muslims made up less than 2% of the population in Quebec. This means that the vast majority of religious people in Quebec are likely Catholic or another religion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no - most religious people in Quebec are not likely to refer to the Quran because they are not Muslim."
