On average, a monkey's lifespan can range from 10-50 years depending on the species, while a human's lifespan can range from 70-90 years. \n\nSo, from this information, it seems unlikely that a monkey would outlive a human being on average. However, this is just a generalization and does not necessarily apply to every individual monkey and human. \n\nAdditionally, there are many other factors that can affect lifespan, such as genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Therefore, while it is possible for a monkey to outlive a human in certain circumstances, it is not likely on average. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, a monkey would not outlive a human being on average."

Monkeys typically live for around 20-40 years in the wild, while humans have an average lifespan of around 70-80 years. Therefore, it might seem possible that a monkey could outlive a human being, given that some humans might not live beyond their 40s.\n\nHowever, we must also consider factors such as medical care and advances in technology. Human beings have access to medical care throughout their lives, which can help them to live longer and manage or cure illnesses. Additionally, humans have developed technology to help them stay healthy and prolong their lives (e.g. vaccines, medication, and medical procedures). Monkeys, on the other hand, do not have access to the same kind of medical care, and are more susceptible to diseases and illnesses that could shorten their lifespans.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, it is more likely that a human being would outlive a monkey on average, rather than the other way around. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no."

Since the average lifespan of humans is greater than that of monkeys, the correct answer is (B) no, a monkey would not outlive a human being on average.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that even though some monkeys may live longer than some humans, in general, humans have a longer lifespan than monkeys."

According to research, monkeys generally have a lifespan of 10-50 years, depending on the species, while humans have a lifespan of approximately 70-90 years.\n\nSecondly, we can also observe that humans have advanced medical care, nutrition, and access to clean water, which increases their chances of longevity. Monkeys, on the other hand, have a limited access to medical care and advanced nutrition.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that on average humans outlive monkeys, making the answer to the question (B) no - a monkey would not outlive a human being."

Chimpanzees, the closest primate relatives to humans, have an average lifespan of 35-40 years in the wild and up to 60 years in captivity. In comparison, the average lifespan for humans in many countries is over 70 years, and it is continuing to increase with medical advancements.\n\nTherefore, it is highly unlikely that a monkey would outlive a human being on average.

However, to determine whether a monkey would outlive a human being, we need to consider the average lifespan of both species.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the current global average life expectancy for humans is around 72 years. On the other hand, the average lifespan of monkeys varies based on the species. For example, the average lifespan of a capuchin monkey is around 15-25 years in the wild and up to 45 years in captivity. Other species, such as the Macaque, have an average lifespan of around 20-30 years.\n\nSo, from these statistics, it is clear that a human being would outlive a monkey on average. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is (B) no.\n\nIn conclusion, while monkeys may outlive humans in some isolated cases, on average, human beings have a longer lifespan."

While some monkeys might have a longer life span than others, the factors affecting their life span are largely out of their control, as they live in natural habitats and have to face predators and other environmental challenges.\n\nOn the other hand, humans have a much greater control over their environment and can make lifestyle choices that affect their life span. For example, humans can choose to eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and avoid risky behaviors like smoking and excessive drinking.\n\nTherefore, while there may be individual cases where a monkey might outlive a human being, on average, humans have a longer life span due to the control they have over their environment and lifestyle choices. So the correct answer is option (B) no."

In contrast, the average life span of a human being is around 79 years. \n\nThis means that, in general, humans live much longer than monkeys. Therefore, the answer to this question is \"no,\" a monkey would not outlive a human being on average. \n\nThere are certain exceptions, of course.
