It is a puzzle game that consists of a 9 x 9 grid where every row, column, and 3 x 3 subgrid must contain numbers from 1 to 9, without any repetition. \n\nNow, Roman numerals are a different system of writing numbers, where they use letters to represent numbers. The numerals are I, V, X, L, C, D and M, which represent 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000, respectively. \n\nIt is clear that using Roman numerals in Sudoku would not work because the puzzle game requires numbers to be from 1 to 9. Even if we assign values to the Roman numerals and try to use them in place of numbers, we will not have nine distinct options, which are necessary for every row, column, and 3 x 3 subgrid to have a unique solution without repetition.

For example, the number 1 can be represented by the numeral I, but the number 9 needs to be represented as IX, which is a combination of two symbols. \n\nIn Sudoku, each box can only have one digit from 1 to 9, and since Roman numerals cannot represent all of the digits from 1 to 9 using only one symbol, it is not possible to fill the normal number of Sudoku box options with Roman numerals.

Roman numerals, on the other hand, represent different values and are not part of the standard set of numbers used in Sudoku. \n\nSo, if we try to use Roman numerals to fill the Sudoku boxes, we would face multiple issues. For example, there are no numerals in Roman numerals to represent 0 or the numbers 6, 7, 8, and 9. Additionally, since Sudoku puzzles require each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid to have all the numbers from 1 to 9, it would be impossible to have this variety of numbers with Roman numerals. \n\nSo, in summary, using Roman numerals would make it impossible to create a standard Sudoku puzzle with a valid solution.
