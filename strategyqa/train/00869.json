A robusto is a type of cigar that is typically around 5 inches long and has a ring gauge (thickness) of 50-52. \n\nNext, we need to consider the context - Central Park Zoo. Central Park Zoo is a public outdoor space where animals are kept and viewed by visitors. \n\nSo, would it be wise to bring a robusto into Central Park Zoo? The answer is no. \n\nFirstly, smoking is not allowed in public parks in NYC, including Central Park. It is against the law to smoke or use tobacco products in any form near or around animals in NYC public parks. This means that bringing a robusto and smoking it in the park (even outside of the zoo area) is against the law.\n\nFurthermore, smoking near animals can be harmful to them. Tobacco products contain chemicals such as nicotine and tar that can be toxic to animals, especially those with sensitive respiratory systems like birds and small mammals. \n\nIn summary, bringing a robusto into Central Park Zoo would not be wise because it's against the law to smoke in public parks in NYC and smoking near animals can harm them."
