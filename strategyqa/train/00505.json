The war doctor is a version of the Doctor played by John Hurt who appears in the 50th anniversary special episode \"The Day of the Doctor\". His successor is the Twelfth Doctor, played by Peter Capaldi. \n\nNext, we need to determine who had more screen time. To do this, we can look at the number of episodes each appeared in. The war doctor appeared in only one episode, while the Twelfth Doctor appeared in 40 episodes. This means that the Twelfth Doctor had significantly more screen time than the war doctor. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, the war doctor did not get more screen time than his successor."

The war doctor is a version of the Doctor played by John Hurt, who appears in the 50th anniversary special episode \"The Day of the Doctor.\" His successor is the 12th Doctor, played by Peter Capaldi. \n\nNext, we need to think about their screen time. The war doctor's appearance is limited to just one episode, \"The Day of the Doctor,\" while the 12th Doctor appears in several seasons of the show. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, as the war doctor did not get more screen time than his successor."

Based on the episodes each actor appeared in, it's clear that David Tennant had significantly more screen time than John Hurt.\n\nDavid Tennant played the Tenth Doctor for three full series (seasons) of Doctor Who, as well as several specials, spanning from 2005 to 2010. In total, he appeared in 47 episodes.\n\nOn the other hand, John Hurt only appeared in one episode as the war doctor, the aforementioned \"Day of the Doctor.\" While he did have a significant role in the episode, he ultimately had far less screen time than David Tennant's Tenth Doctor had in his multiple series and specials.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, the war doctor did not get more screen time than his successor, the Tenth Doctor."

In order to answer this question, we need to compare the amount of screen time each of them had.\n\nIf we look at the episodes they appeared in, the war doctor only appeared in one episode, \"The Day of the Doctor,\" which was the 50th-anniversary special. On the other hand, Eccleston's incarnation of the Doctor appeared in 13 episodes of the show's first season.\n\nSo, it's clear that Eccleston's Doctor got significantly more screen time than the war doctor, who only appeared in one episode.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the war doctor did not get more screen time than his successor."

The War Doctor appears only in \"The Day of the Doctor,\" which has a runtime of 76 minutes. The Eighth Doctor, on the other hand, appears in the TV movie which has a runtime of 86 minutes, and in the mini-episode which runs for roughly 7 minutes. So altogether, the Eighth Doctor has appeared on screen for a total of around 93 minutes, which is more than the War Doctor's single appearance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the War Doctor did not get more screen time than his successor."

The war doctor appeared in only one episode, \"The Day of the Doctor,\" which was a special episode commemorating the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who. His appearance in this episode was significant as it revealed previously unknown details about the Time War and his role in ending it. In contrast, all three of his successors appeared in multiple seasons and episodes, giving them a significant amount of screen time.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently answer that the war doctor did not get more screen time than his successors, making the answer to the question (B) no."

The Ninth Doctor appeared in 13 episodes of the 2005 series, whereas the War Doctor appeared in only one episode, which was the special 50th-anniversary episode. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, the Ninth Doctor got more screen time than the War Doctor."
