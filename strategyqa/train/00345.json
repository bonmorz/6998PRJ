Nice is a brand that produces honey, primarily sourced from the United States. To produce honey, bees are needed to pollinate the flowers that produce the nectar, which is then converted into honey by the bees.\n\nTherefore, if Nice is producing honey in the United States, it is likely that they are using Western honey bee, which is the most common and widely used species for commercial beekeeping in the country. Hence, the answer to the question is (A) yes, US brand Nice does depend on Western honey bee."
