On average, a newborn measures around 20 inches in length. \n\nNext, we need to consider the size of a fully grown horseradish plant. These plants can grow up to 3 feet in height, which is equivalent to 36 inches. \n\nTherefore, if we subtract the height of a newborn from the height of a fully grown horseradish plant, we get: \n\n36 inches - 20 inches = 16 inches \n\nThis means that the top of the horseradish plant would be 16 inches higher than the height of a newborn baby. As a result, the newborn would not be able to look over the top of a fully grown horseradish plant. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

A fully grown horseradish plant can reach a height of 2-3 feet (60-90 cm). \nTherefore, a newborn's height is much shorter compared to a fully grown horseradish plant.

Therefore, the height difference between a newborn and a fully grown horseradish plant is significant. \n\nSecondly, in order for a newborn to look over the top of a fully grown horseradish plant, the plant would have to be shorter than the newborn's eye level. However, a newborn's eye level is around 25-30 cm (10-12 inches) from the ground, which means that the newborn would need to be standing on something elevated to even have a chance of looking over the top of the horseradish plant. \n\nGiven these facts, it is highly unlikely that a newborn could look over the top of a fully grown horseradish plant without the assistance of some external aid such as a ladder, a stool, or being held up by an adult. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

A newborn typically ranges from 19 to 21 inches in length, and a fully grown horseradish plant can grow up to 3 feet tall. \n\nNext, we need to consider the angle of sight. A newborn's angle of sight is approximately 45 degrees, whereas a horseradish plant is generally fixed in an upward direction, and the leaves and flowers are situated at the top of the plant.\n\nTaking these two factors into consideration, we can conclude that a newborn would not be able to look over the top of a fully grown horseradish plant due to the height and angle of the plant. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."
