He is not a real person and therefore, cannot make a purchase. \n\nNext, Zazzle is an online marketplace that allows users to customize and create their own products, such as shirts, phone cases, and mugs. While it is possible for someone to purchase items on Zazzle, we have established that Mickey Mouse cannot make a purchase since he does not exist in real life. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, Mickey Mouse is hypothetically unlikely to make a purchase at Zazzle."
