However, cannons are a more complex creation that involves a greater knowledge of metallurgy, engineering, and chemistry. Cannons were not widely used until the 14th century, well after the bronze age had ended. Therefore, it can be assumed that during the bronze age, all the materials to make a cannon were not known, hence the correct answer is (B) no."

A cannon is a large gun that fires heavy projectiles, typically made of metal, such as cannonballs. \n\nNow that we have an understanding of the time period and the object in question, we can answer the question. While bronze was used to make weapons during the bronze age, cannons did not exist until much later. Cannons were first used in battles during the 14th century, which is well after the bronze age had ended.
