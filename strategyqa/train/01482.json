Next, the question is asking about their eating habits - do they use chopsticks? Therefore, to answer this question, we need to know some basic information about Nissan's headquarters and the culture in Japan. \n\nNissan is headquartered in Yokohama, Japan, where the cultural norm for eating is to use chopsticks. They are the primary eating utensil in Japanese cuisine and are typically used for most meals, except for those that require a spoon or fork (such as soup or salad). \n\nTherefore, based on this cultural context and the location of Nissan's headquarters, the answer to the question is (A) yes, workers at Nissan's headquarters likely eat with chopsticks. While it's not a certainty that every single worker exclusively uses chopsticks to eat, it is certainly the cultural norm in Japan and likely the preferred utensil choice for many employees."
