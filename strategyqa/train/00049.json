According to the Guinness World Records, the heaviest cheeseburger weighed 1,164 kg (2,566 lbs). \nNext, we consider Eddie Hall's personal best deadlift, which is 500 kg (1,102 lbs). While this is an incredibly impressive weight, it is still only about half the weight of the world's largest cheeseburger. Therefore, Eddie Hall could not hypothetically deadlift the world's largest cheeseburger, making answer choice (B) the correct answer."
