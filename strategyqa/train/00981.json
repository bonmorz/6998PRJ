White rice and sesame seeds are both low in fat content, so rancidity is not a major concern for either of them. However, both can still spoil or become stale over time due to other factors such as moisture, mold, or insect infestation.\n\nIn terms of shelf life, white rice has a longer shelf life than sesame seeds. White rice can last for years if stored properly in a cool, dry place, whereas sesame seeds have a shorter shelf life of several months to a year. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that white rice would go rancid before sesame seeds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

                "content": "First, we need to understand what it means for food to go rancid. When a food goes rancid, it means that the oils in the food have oxidized, leading to a change in taste and smell. This can happen to any type of food that contains oils, including rice and sesame seeds.\n\nNext, we need to consider the factors that can contribute to food going rancid. One factor is exposure to air and light, which can accelerate oxidation. Another factor is the level of moisture in the food, as moisture can also contribute to oxidation.\n\nWith these factors in mind, let's consider the question. Could white rice go rancid before sesame seeds? The answer is no, white rice is less likely to go rancid before sesame seeds.\n\nHere's why: white rice has had its bran and germ removed, which means it contains fewer oils than sesame seeds. Oils are more susceptible to oxidation than other types of molecules found in food. Therefore, sesame seeds are more likely to go rancid than white rice.\n\nIn addition, sesame seeds are small and have a higher surface area to volume ratio than rice. This means that they are exposed to more air than rice, which can accelerate oxidation.\n\nOverall, while both white rice and sesame seeds can go rancid, sesame seeds are more likely to do so before white rice. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

Rancidity is the process of spoilage that occurs in fats and oils when they are exposed to air, light, or heat. This process causes the food to develop an unpleasant taste and smell.\n\nNow, let's consider the two items in question: white rice and sesame seeds. Both of these foods have a relatively long shelf life and are unlikely to spoil quickly. However, it is possible for both white rice and sesame seeds to become rancid over time.\n\nWhen comparing the two items, there are a few factors to consider. White rice is a grain, while sesame seeds are a type of seed. Grains tend to have a longer shelf life than seeds, as they are less prone to spoilage. Additionally, white rice is often processed and polished, which can help to extend its shelf life even further.\n\nOn the other hand, sesame seeds are more susceptible to rancidity due to their high oil content. Oils are more prone to spoilage than other types of foods, especially when they are exposed to air, light, or heat.\n\nGiven these factors, it is unlikely that white rice would go rancid before sesame seeds. While both items may eventually spoil, the white rice is more likely to hold up over time due to its lower oil content and processing methods. Therefore, the correct answer is (B): no."

While rice is a cereal grain, sesame seeds are oilseeds. \n\nNow, concerning rancidity, it is a common problem of foods containing fats or oils. When fats and oils are exposed to air, heat, and light, their chemical structure changes, leading to the formation of unpleasant and potentially harmful compounds. This process is called rancidity.\n\nRice contains very little fat and is therefore less prone to rancidity. In contrast, sesame seeds are rich in oil (around 50% of their weight) and are therefore more susceptible to rancidity. \n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that white rice will go rancid before sesame seeds, making the correct answer (B) no."

White rice is a starchy carbohydrate that doesn't contain a significant amount of fat or oil. On the other hand, sesame seeds are high in oil content, particularly healthy unsaturated fats. Therefore, sesame seeds are more prone to rancidity than white rice because they have more fats that can break down. \n\nTo summarize, white rice is less likely to go rancid because it doesn't have as much fat as sesame seeds. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no."
