Popular science refers to scientific knowledge and information that is presented in ways that are accessible and understandable to a general audience. It is often used in books, magazines, and websites that aim to popularize science and make it more accessible and engaging to everyone.\n\nNext, we need to understand what is meant by the term \"peer review\". Peer review is a process by which scientific papers are evaluated by independent experts in the same field before they are accepted for publication. This process helps to ensure the quality and accuracy of the research presented in the paper, by evaluating its methodology, results, and conclusions.\n\nBased on these definitions, we can conclude that popular science is not used to peer review papers. Popular science may help to disseminate information about scientific discoveries and research, but it is not a formal process of evaluating the quality or accuracy of scientific papers. Peer review is a rigorous and systematic process that is carried out by experts in the field, and it plays a critical role in ensuring the scientific validity and reliability of research."

Popular science refers to articles or books that are written for a general audience, often with the aim of making complex scientific concepts more accessible or interesting.\n\nSo, would popular science be used for peer review? No, it wouldn't. While popular science writers may have a background in science, they are not typically experts in the specific field that they are writing about. Additionally, popular science articles are meant for a general audience and may not be detailed enough to fully critique a scientific paper. \n\nIn contrast, peer review involves having experts in the same field review a scientific paper and provide feedback based on their expertise. Popular science articles simply do not serve the same purpose as peer review."
