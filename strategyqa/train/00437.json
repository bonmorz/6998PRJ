The Quran explicitly states that consuming pork is prohibited for Muslims (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:173). Therefore, if a Muslim follows the teachings of Islam, they would not be able to eat a McRib sandwich or any other food that contains pork. Hence, the correct answer is (B) no."

In Islam, consumption of pork is strictly prohibited. Therefore, a Muslim cannot eat a McRib sandwich.\n\nAdditionally, it should be noted that some sources indicate that even the flavoring used in the McRib sandwich may contain alcohol, which is also prohibited in Islam. Therefore, it is advised for Muslims to avoid consuming this product.\n\nOverall, the answer to this question is no, a Muslim cannot eat a McRib sandwich due to the presence of pork and alcohol, which are prohibited in Islam."
