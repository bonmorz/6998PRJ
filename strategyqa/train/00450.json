It is responsible for the control of the body and communication among its parts. \n\nSecondly, let's define what the torso is. The torso or trunk is an anatomical term used to refer to the central part of the human body where the abdomen, chest, and back are located. \n\nNow, based on these definitions, we can conclude that the brain is not located in the torso. The brain is located in the head, which is the uppermost part of the body and is connected to the torso by the neck. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, the brain is not located in the torso."
