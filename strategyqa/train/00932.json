Chrome OS is an operating system developed by Google that is specifically designed for use with web applications and cloud-based storage. \n\nNext, let's consider how web applications and cloud-based storage work. Web applications are programs that run on a web server rather than on your local device. This means that in order to use a web application, you need to be connected to the internet. Similarly, cloud-based storage refers to online storage services where your files are stored remotely rather than on your local device. Again, in order to access these files, you need to be connected to the internet. \n\nSo, given that Chrome OS is designed for use with web applications and cloud-based storage, it follows that an internet connection is essential for someone using Chrome OS. Without an internet connection, you wouldn't be able to access the web applications or cloud storage that Chrome OS is designed to work with. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, an internet connection is essential for someone using Chrome OS."
