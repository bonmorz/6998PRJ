These lakes are Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario. \n\nNext, we need to understand what an international border is. An international border refers to a boundary that separates two countries. \n\nNow, let's put these two concepts together. Are the Great Lakes part of an international border? Yes, they are. The border between Canada and the United States runs through four of the Great Lakes: Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Erie. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes."

The Great Lakes are a group of five freshwater lakes located in North America, consisting of Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario. These lakes are shared between the United States and Canada. \n\nThe next step is to determine if the borders of the United States and Canada intersect with the Great Lakes. It is essential to know that the Great Lakes are bordered by both the United States and Canada. So, any maritime borders or boundaries between the two countries will pass through the Great Lakes. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"yes,\" the Great Lakes are part of an international border."

The lakes are Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario.\n\nNext, we need to know if these lakes are part of an international border. Yes, they are. The Great Lakes form an important part of the border between Canada and the United States. Specifically, Lake Superior, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario form parts of the border between the two countries. The boundary is mainly defined by the international treaty known as the Boundary Waters Treaty, which was signed in 1909.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (A) yes, the Great Lakes are part of an international border between Canada and the United States."

Lake Ontario is connected to the St. Lawrence River, which forms part of the border between Canada and the United States. \n\nTherefore, since Lake Ontario is one of the Great Lakes and is connected to an international border, we can conclude that the Great Lakes are part of an international border.

An international border is a boundary line between two or more countries. \n\nNow, we can answer the question. The Great Lakes are indeed part of an international border. They form a natural border between the United States and Canada. Three of the Great Lakes (Superior, Huron, and Michigan) are shared by both countries, while Lake Erie is only shared by the United States and Canada, and Lake Ontario is shared only by Canada and the United States. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

The answer is yes, as the Great Lakes form part of the boundary between Canada and the United States.
