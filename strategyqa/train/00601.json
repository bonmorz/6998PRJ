This means that he lived a long time ago, well before the establishment of Pound sterling as a currency. Pound sterling was first introduced in England in the 12th century, long after Emperor Commodus had passed away. Therefore, it is not possible that he was paid tribute in Pound sterling. The correct answer is (B) no."
