The University of Pittsburgh, as we know it today, was formed in 1908 as a result of a merger between the Western University of Pennsylvania and the Pittsburgh College of Medicine and its associated hospital. \n\nBased on this information, we can see that there is no direct correlation between Millard Fillmore and the founding or establishment of the University of Pittsburgh. It was already in existence before he became President, and it continued to operate after his term ended.
