The Sea of Japan is located between Japan and the Korean Peninsula. \n\nNow, it is known that the height of Mount Fuji is 3,776.24 meters (12,389 feet). The depth of the Sea of Japan reaches a maximum depth of 3,742.3 meters (12,277 feet). \n\nThus, if Mount Fuji were to be placed in the Sea of Japan, the top of Mount Fuji would stick out above the sea level.

The average depth of the Sea of Japan is 1,752 meters (5,748 feet). \n\nTo determine if the top of Mount Fuji would stick out of the Sea of Japan, we need to compare their elevations and depths. We subtract the average depth of the Sea of Japan from the elevation of Mount Fuji: \n\n3,776.24 - 1,752 = 2,024.24 meters (6,639.016 feet)\n\nBased on this calculation, the top of Mount Fuji is higher than the depth of the Sea of Japan. Therefore, the top of Mount Fuji would stick out of the Sea of Japan. The answer is (A) yes."

The official height of the mountain is 3,776.24 meters (12,389 feet). \n\nNow, let's take a look at the Sea of Japan. It is bordered by Japan to the east and Korea and Russia to the west. The sea has an average depth of around 1,500 meters (4,900 ft). \n\nBased on these facts, we can conclude that the top of Mount Fuji would not be underwater in the Sea of Japan. With a height of over 3,700 meters (12,000 feet), the peak of Mount Fuji would rise well above the surface of the sea. Therefore, the correct answer is (A): yes, the top of Mount Fuji would stick out of the Sea of Japan."

Mount Fuji is located on the island of Honshu in Japan.  \n\nNext, we need to determine the location of the Sea of Japan. The Sea of Japan is located to the west of Japan, between Japan and the Asian mainland. \n\nNow, we can analyze whether the top of Mount Fuji would stick out of the Sea of Japan. We know that Mount Fuji is approximately 12,388 feet (3,776 meters) high. The Sea of Japan, on the other hand, has a maximum depth of around 12,276 feet (3,742 meters). This means that the sea bed of the Sea of Japan is actually lower than the peak of Mount Fuji. \n\nTherefore, if we imagine a hypothetical scenario in which the Sea of Japan was completely drained, we can assume that the top of Mount Fuji would indeed stick out above sea level. Hence, the correct answer is (A) yes."
