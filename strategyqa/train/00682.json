Pedubastis I was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh who ruled during the third Intermediate period, which was around 800-700 BCE. Now, let's think about Japan. Japan is a country located in East Asia and has its own distinct culture and language. \n\nSince Pedubastis I lived in ancient Egypt, and Japan is located far away in East Asia, it is highly unlikely that he would have had any direct contact or communication with Japanese people. Additionally, during Pedubastis I's time, Japan was not the developed and populous country that it is today, and there would have been no reason for ancient Egypt and Japan to have any significant interaction.\n\nTherefore, based on historical facts and geographical distance, we can safely say that Pedubastis I did not know Japanese people. As a result, the answer to the multiple choice question is (B) no."

This means that there is a huge gap of time and distance between Pedubastis I and the emergence of Japan as a nation. Therefore, there is no historical evidence to suggest that Pedubastis I knew about the existence of Japanese people, making answer (B) the correct choice."

According to historical records, the earliest contact between Japan and Egypt did not occur until the 7th century AD, which is over a thousand years after Pedubastis I's reign!
