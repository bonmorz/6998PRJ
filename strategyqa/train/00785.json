                "content": "First, we need to understand what isopropyl alcohol is. Isopropyl alcohol is a type of alcohol that is commonly used as a solvent, disinfectant, and antiseptic. Now, let's consider salt. Salt is an ionic compound that is composed of positively charged ions (sodium) and negatively charged ions (chloride). \n\nWhen we mix salt with isopropyl alcohol, the salt ions will interact with the polarity of the alcohol. Isopropyl alcohol is a polar solvent, which means that it has a partial positive charge on one end and a partial negative charge on the other end. This polarity allows it to dissolve other polar substances. However, salt is an ionic compound and is not polar. In fact, it is very polar and has a strong attraction between its ions. \n\nTherefore, when we mix salt with isopropyl alcohol, the salt ions will not dissolve easily in the alcohol. The strong attraction between the salt ions will prevent them from being pulled apart and surrounded by the isopropyl alcohol molecules. This means that the solubility of salt in isopropyl alcohol will be low. Hence, the answer is (A) yes."

However, compared to other solvents like water or ethanol, isopropyl alcohol is not as polar. \n\nSalt consists of ions, which are polar molecules. Polar molecules will dissolve best in solvents that are also polar. Since isopropyl alcohol is not as polar as other solvents, it is not as effective in dissolving salts.

Therefore, the solubility of salt in isopropyl alcohol is low, as there are no attractive forces between the solvent molecules and the salt ions to facilitate dissolution. This is why the correct answer is (A): in isopropyl alcohol, the solubility of salt is low."

To do this, we can consult a solubility table. According to such tables, salts typically have low solubility in non-polar solvents such as isopropyl alcohol.
