The story is set during World War I, which lasted from 1914 to 1918. \n\nSecondly, we need to establish the year in which Steven Spielberg's 1998 film was released. Since the question specifically mentions the year, we can assume that the film being referred to is \"Saving Private Ryan\", which was released in 1998. \n\nThirdly, we need to establish the time period in which \"Saving Private Ryan\" is set. The film is set during World War II, which lasted from 1939 to 1945.\n\nNow, if we compare the time periods mentioned in the question and the above analysis, we can say that \"Saving Private Ryan\" takes place after the setting of War Horse. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

Spielberg has directed many films, so we need to identify which specific film is being referred to. However, the question mentions that the film takes place after the setting of War Horse, which gives us a clue to the time period. \n\nWe know that War Horse is set during World War I, which ended in 1918. Therefore, any period after that would be after the setting of War Horse. Spielberg's 1998 film is Saving Private Ryan, which is set during World War II, specifically in 1944. \n\nSince World War II took place after World War I, we can conclude that Spielberg's 1998 film takes place in a period after the setting of War Horse.

Steven Spielberg did not release a film in 1998. If the question meant to ask about a different Steven Spielberg film, we would need to determine its release date and time period. Once we establish the time period of the film, we can compare it to the time period of War Horse. If the film takes place after War Horse, the answer would be yes, and if not, the answer would be no.

The movie adaptation of War Horse, directed by Spielberg, was released in 2011, but it still takes place during World War I.\n\nNow, we need to determine the time period of Spielberg's 1998 film. Spielberg directed several movies in 1998, including Saving Private Ryan and The Mask of Zorro, but neither of these movies is set in a time period that comes after World War I. However, another movie that Spielberg directed in 1998 is A.I. Artificial Intelligence. This movie is set in a future world where advanced robots have become a part of everyday life, and it takes place in the years after the 21st century.\n\nTherefore, we can determine that Steven Spielberg's 1998 film does take place in a period after the setting of War Horse, and the correct answer is (A) yes."
