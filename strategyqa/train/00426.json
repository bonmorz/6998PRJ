A majority is when a candidate gets more than 50% of the votes. \n\nNext, we need to look at the 1912 election.

The popular vote is the total number of votes each candidate received from the American people. \n\nAccording to historical data and records, when we add up the popular votes of all the four candidates, no one received more than 50% of the votes.

Additionally, Theodore Roosevelt ran as a third-party candidate under the Progressive Party. \n\nWhen we look at the final results of the popular vote, we see that no candidate received a majority (meaning over 50%) of the total vote.

Debs of the Socialist Party, received smaller portions of the vote. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, as no candidate in the 1912 election received a majority of the popular vote."
