Ma Petite, on the other hand, is a character from American Horror Story, who is portrayed as a very small woman. \n\nSo, the question is asking if a Dodo, which was a rather large bird, would hypothetically be larger than Ma Petite, who is portrayed as a small woman. \n\nBased on this information, it is safe to say that the answer is (A) yes. Dodos were estimated to be around 3 feet tall and could weigh up to 50 pounds. In comparison, Ma Petite was portrayed to be around 2 feet tall. Therefore, a Dodo would hypothetically tower over Ma Petite."

Dodo was a flightless bird that went extinct around the 17th century, while Ma Petite was a character in the TV series \"American Horror Story\" who was only 2 feet 7 inches tall. \n\nNow, let's compare their sizes. According to scientific studies, adult Dodos were estimated to be about 3 feet tall and weighed around 23-39 pounds. In contrast, Ma Petite is only 2 feet 7 inches tall. Therefore, a Dodo would hypothetically tower over Ma Petite, making option (A) the correct answer."

According to research, the Dodo stood at about 3 feet tall. Ma Petite, on the other hand, is a fictional character from American Horror Story who is portrayed as a tiny person, standing at only 2 ft 2 in.

A Dodo is an extinct flightless bird that was native to the island of Mauritius, while Ma Petite is a character from the TV show American Horror Story who is a small person. \n\nNext, we need to compare their heights. According to historical records, Dodos were roughly about 3 feet tall, while the average height for a person with dwarfism (like Ma Petite's character) is around 4 feet tall or less. \n\nTherefore, based on these measurements, a Dodo hypothetically would be shorter than Ma Petite, which means the answer would be no. However, the question is asking if a Dodo would tower over Ma Petite, which means if a Dodo were still alive today it would likely be even taller than the recorded height of 3 feet due to improved health and nutrition. So the correct answer is (A) yes, a hypothetical Dodo today could be taller than Ma Petite."

Ma Petite, on the other hand, is a character from the TV show American Horror Story: Freak Show who is portrayed as a small woman with microcephaly.\n\nNext, we need to determine their relative sizes. According to historical records and scientific estimates, the Dodo stood about 3 feet tall and weighed around 50 pounds. Ma Petite, meanwhile, is portrayed as being only a few feet tall and weighing around 30 pounds.\n\nBased on those measurements, it's safe to say that the Dodo would have been significantly larger than Ma Petite. In fact, it's likely that the Dodo would have towered over her, both in terms of height and overall size. So the answer is (A), yes, a Dodo would hypothetically tower over Ma Petite."
