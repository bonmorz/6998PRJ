Conductors are musicians who lead orchestras, bands or ensembles. They help coordinate different instruments playing together by using gestures and cues. Therefore, solo pianists don't require a conductor because they don't have to coordinate their playing with any other musicians or instruments. So, the correct answer is (B) no."

A solo pianist performs alone, without any other musicians.

A conductor is essentially responsible for directing and leading a musical ensemble, such as an orchestra or choir, and ensuring that all members are performing together in harmony. They typically use hand gestures and cues to convey musical cues and changes in tempo, dynamics, and expression.\n\nHowever, when it comes to a solo pianist, they are performing alone and do not require direction or coordination with other musicians. Therefore, a conductor is not necessary for a solo pianist as they are not working with an ensemble. Hence, the correct answer is (B) no."

They do not need a conductor to coordinate with other musicians, as they are the only player.
