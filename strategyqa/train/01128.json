It is usually associated with birthday cakes, where we make a wish and blow out the candles to signify making that wish come true. Now, let's consider a funeral. A funeral is a somber occasion where people mourn the loss of a loved one. It is not a celebration, but a time to remember and pay respects to the departed. Therefore, blowing out candles during a funeral would not be normal. It may be considered inappropriate or disrespectful to the solemnity of the occasion. Hence, the correct answer is (B) no."
