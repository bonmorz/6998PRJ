Mount Wycheproof is the smallest mountain in the world located in Australia, with a height of only 43 meters (141 feet). \n\nNext, we need to know who Edmund Hillary is. Sir Edmund Hillary was a New Zealand mountaineer and explorer, who along with Tenzing Norgay, was the first to reach the summit of Mount Everest in 1953.\n\nNow that we know both the facts, we can answer the question. As Mount Wycheproof is the smallest mountain in the world, it would be comparatively easy for a skilled mountaineer like Edmund Hillary to climb. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."
