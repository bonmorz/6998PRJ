The name derives from the arrangement of the keys in the top-left-hand corner of the keyboard, which reads Q-W-E-R-T-Y. \n\nNext, we need to determine the history of the Qwerty keyboard layout. The Qwerty keyboard layout was invented by Christopher Latham Sholes, who was an American inventor, in 1872. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the Qwerty keyboard layout predated computers, as the first computers were not invented until the mid-20th century, approximately 80 years after the invention of the Qwerty keyboard layout. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, the Qwerty keyboard layout did predate computers."

It is a keyboard layout that arranges the keys in a specific order, with the letters Q-W-E-R-T-Y being the first six keys in the top row. Second, we need to know when computers were invented. The first computer, Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, was conceptualized in 1837, but the first electronic digital computer, the Atanasoff-Berry Computer, was built in 1937. Finally, we need to determine if the Qwerty keyboard layout existed before the invention of computers. The answer is yes. The Qwerty layout was designed in the 1870s for the Sholes and Glidden typewriter, which was a mechanical device used for writing before the invention of computers. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."
