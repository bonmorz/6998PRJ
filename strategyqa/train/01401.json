It was the codename for Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II, which started on June 22, 1941. \n\nNow, let's consider Barbarossa's last expedition. This is a bit vague, but most likely refers to the failed German assault on Moscow in late 1941, which was a major part of the overall Operation Barbarossa campaign. The Germans came very close to taking Moscow, but ultimately were repelled by the Soviet defenders in a series of battles that lasted through December 1941. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, Barbarossa's last expedition did not succeed. The Germans were not able to achieve their ultimate goal of capturing Moscow and defeating the Soviet Union, which was a major turning point in the war in the east."

However, there is no additional information given to help us understand what that might be. \n\nTherefore, the answer to this question can only be based on the information we do have, which is about Operation Barbarossa itself. Did it succeed? No, it ultimately failed. Although the Nazis made some initial gains, they were ultimately defeated by the Soviets due to a combination of factors such as superior numbers, harsh weather conditions, and errors in strategy and tactics by the German forces. The failure of Operation Barbarossa was arguably a turning point in the war, as it marked the beginning of a long and costly campaign for the Nazis in the East."

The invasion was launched on June 22, 1941, and it was one of the largest military operations in history. Initially, the German forces made significant gains, but they were eventually stopped and pushed back by Soviet counterattacks. Therefore, Operation Barbarossa did not succeed in achieving its objectives of defeating the Soviet Union and securing German domination over Europe.\n\nBarbarossa's last expedition refers to the failed attempt by the German army to relieve the trapped Sixth Army in Stalingrad in 1943-44. The battle for Stalingrad was a brutal and costly confrontation that ended in a decisive Soviet victory, and the German army suffered heavy losses. Therefore, Barbarossa's last expedition also did not succeed in achieving its goals.\n\nIn summary, both Operation Barbarossa and Barbarossa's last expedition failed to achieve their objectives.

It was the codename for Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II, which began on June 22, 1941. \n\nSo, did Operation Barbarossa succeed? The answer is no. While initial German advances were impressive, the Red Army's ability to regroup and defend, coupled with the harsh winter weather, eventually led to the Germans being pushed back. Subsequent Soviet offensives forced the Germans to retreat all the way back to Germany. So, Operation Barbarossa ultimately failed in achieving its objectives.\n\nNow, what about Barbarossa's last expedition? This is a bit unclear, as the term \"Barbarossa's last expedition\" could refer to various things. One interpretation could refer to a military campaign led by Frederick I (also known as Frederick Barbarossa), the Holy Roman Emperor, who died during the Third Crusade in 1190. In that case, the answer would still be no, as Frederick Barbarossa's expedition did not ultimately succeed in capturing Jerusalem, despite initial victories.\n\nOverall, the answer to the question is (B) no, as neither Operation Barbarossa nor Barbarossa's last expedition achieved lasting success."

It was the code name for Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union in World War II, which began on June 22, 1941. So, the question is asking if this invasion succeeded. \n\nNow, there are different ways to define success in a military operation, but generally, it means achieving the main objectives and gaining a decisive advantage over the enemy. In the case of Operation Barbarossa, the main objectives were to defeat the Soviet armed forces, occupy their territory, and capture Moscow, Leningrad, and other key cities. \n\nHowever, despite some initial successes, such as the encirclement and capture of hundreds of thousands of Soviet soldiers and the advance deep into Soviet territory, the Operation Barbarossa ultimately failed to achieve its goals. The Soviet resistance proved much more resilient and resourceful than the German planners had assumed, and the brutal nature of the fighting and the harsh Russian winter took a heavy toll on the German army. \n\nMoreover, the German army was overstretched and lacked the logistical and industrial capacities to sustain a prolonged campaign in the vast Soviet Union. They also faced a formidable opponent in the form of the Red Army, which gradually improved its tactics, equipment, and morale under the leadership of Stalin and his generals. \n\nAs a result, the German army suffered significant losses and setbacks, especially at the battle of Stalingrad in 1942-43, which marked a turning point in the war. Despite some secondary operations and offensives, such as the last expedition of the Battleship Tirpitz in 1944, the overall outcome was a defeat for the Axis powers and a victory for the Allies. \n\nTherefore, we can confidently answer the question as (B) no, Barbarossa did not succeed in achieving its objectives or securing a decisive advantage over the Soviet Union."

This operation aimed to conquer the Soviet Union and expand Germany's territory. \n\nNow, let's look at the second part of the question, which asks whether Barbarossa's last expedition succeeded. This part is a bit vague, but we can assume that it refers to the later stages of the invasion. \n\nHowever, there is no clear answer to whether Barbarossa's last expedition succeeded or not, as it depends on how we define \"success.\" \n\nIf we consider the fact that the Soviet Union was able to repel the German invasion and ultimately win the war, then we could argue that Barbarossa was not a success. In this sense, Barbarossa's last expedition could be seen as a desperate attempt by the Germans to turn the war around, but ultimately failed to achieve its objectives. \n\nOn the other hand, if we focus on specific battles within Barbarossa, there were certainly some instances where the Germans achieved tactical victories. For example, they captured several major cities such as Kiev and Smolensk, and inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviet army. \n\nHowever, even these victories did not ultimately lead to a German victory in the war, as the Soviet Union was able to recover and push the Germans back. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, since Operation Barbarossa did not ultimately succeed in achieving its goals, despite some tactical victories."
