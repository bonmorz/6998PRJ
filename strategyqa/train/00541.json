Second, we need to know if mountain goats are capable of surviving on Mars. However, mountain goats are not native to Mars, nor have they been introduced to the planet. Therefore, it is safe to assume that mountain goats do not inhabit the summit of Mount Sharp. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

However, even if we assume that the question is referring to a real-life Mount Sharp, it is still unlikely that mountain goats would inhabit its summit. Mountain goats are typically found in the rocky areas of mountain ranges, but they usually do not venture to the highest points of mountains. Furthermore, the summit of Mount Sharp is known to be a barren rocky terrain, which would not provide sufficient vegetation for the mountain goats to survive. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
