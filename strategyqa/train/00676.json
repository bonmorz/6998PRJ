Al Pacino and Margaret Qualley both have a Bacon Number of 2. This means that they have both appeared in a film with an actor who then appeared in a different film with Kevin Bacon.\n\nFor example, Al Pacino appeared in the film \"Heat\" with Robert De Niro, who also starred in \"Sleepers\" with Kevin Bacon. Meanwhile, Margaret Qualley appeared in the film \"The Nice Guys\" with Ryan Gosling, who also starred in \"Crazy, Stupid, Love.\" with Kevin Bacon.\n\nSince both Al Pacino and Margaret Qualley have a Bacon Number of 2, they will score the same amount of Bacon Number points.

We need to find out if Al Pacino and Margaret Qualley have the same Bacon Number. To do this, we can search for the number of links each actor has to Kevin Bacon.\n\nAl Pacino has acted in the movie \"The Recruit\" with Colin Farrell, who acted in \"Crazy Heart\" with Jeff Bridges, who acted in \"R.I.P.D.\" with Kevin Bacon. So, Al Pacino's Bacon Number is 3.\n\nMargaret Qualley has acted in the movie \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" with Leonardo DiCaprio, who acted in \"J.

For example, if an actor has appeared in a movie with Kevin Bacon, their Bacon Number is 1. If they have appeared in a movie with someone who has appeared in a movie with Kevin Bacon, their Bacon Number is 2, and so on.\n\nNow, coming to the question, we need to find out the Bacon Number of Al Pacino and Margaret Qualley separately. Let's start with Al Pacino.\n\nAl Pacino has appeared in the movie \"The Godfather\" with James Caan, who has appeared in \"Jinxed!\" with Kevin Bacon. So, Al Pacino's Bacon Number is 2.\n\nNow, let's find out the Bacon Number of Margaret Qualley. Margaret Qualley has not appeared in a movie with Kevin Bacon directly. But, she has appeared in \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" with Brad Pitt, who has appeared in \"Sleepers\" with Kevin Bacon. So, Margaret Qualley's Bacon Number is also 2.\n\nTherefore, we can see that both Al Pacino and Margaret Qualley have the same Bacon Number, which is 2.

To answer this question, we need to check whether they have worked with Kevin Bacon or not.\n\nAl Pacino has not directly worked with Kevin Bacon, according to his IMDB page. However, he has worked with Marisa Tomei in the movie \"The Son of No One\". Marisa Tomei, in turn, has worked with Kevin Bacon in the movie \"Loverboy\".
