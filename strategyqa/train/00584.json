According to the United Nations, as of 2020, the estimated population of Earth is around 7.8 billion people.\n- Next, we need to know the estimated number of stars in the Milky Way. This can be a bit tricky, as it is difficult to count all the stars in the galaxy. However, astronomers estimate that there are anywhere between 100 and 400 billion stars in the Milky Way.\n- To determine if the number of stars in the Milky Way is at least ten times Earth's population, we need to do some math. We can start by using the lower estimate of stars in the Milky Way (100 billion) and see if it is at least ten times the population of Earth (7.8 billion x 10).\n\n100 billion stars / (7.8 billion x 10) = 1.28\n\n- The result is 1.28, which means that there are 1.28 stars in the Milky Way for every person on Earth. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes \u2013 the number of stars in the Milky Way is indeed at least ten times Earth's population."
