The 13th Amendment was ratified on December 6, 1865, which ended slavery in the United States. Little Women was first published on September 30, 1868. \n\nThis means that Louisa May Alcott was alive during the ratification of the 13th Amendment, and it is highly likely that she would remember such a significant event in American history. Additionally, Alcott's family was heavily involved in the abolitionist movement, which further suggests that she would have been paying close attention to the progress of legislation like the 13th Amendment. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

This information is important because it helps us understand the timeline of events related to the ratification of the 13th Amendment. \n\nNow, let's move to the ratification of the 13th Amendment. The 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for a crime. This amendment was ratified on December 6, 1865. \n\nBased on this information, we know that the ratification of the 13th Amendment happened before Alcott wrote Little Women. Therefore, it is likely that Alcott would have remembered the ratification of the 13th Amendment since it was a significant event in history that happened in the very recent past. \n\nThus, the answer to the question is (A) yes, the author of Little Women would have remembered the ratification of the 13th Amendment."

The story is set during the Civil War era, specifically in 1861-1862. \n\nBased on the timeline, we can conclude that Little Women is set before the ratification of the 13th Amendment. However, the question is not asking if the events in Little Women take place after the ratification of the 13th Amendment. The question is asking if the author, Louisa May Alcott, would have remembered the ratification. \n\nGiven that Louisa May Alcott was an abolitionist and wrote about progressive social issues in her other works, it is highly likely that she would have remembered the ratification of the 13th Amendment.

It is highly likely that Alcott would have been aware of the passage of the 13th Amendment because it was a significant event in American history that was widely discussed at the time.

This makes it very plausible that Alcott would have remembered the ratification of the 13th Amendment. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."
