Anorexia Nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by a distorted body image, an intense fear of gaining weight, and a restriction of food intake, leading to a significantly low body weight. \n\nNow, let's consider the question. The question asks if red legs are a sign of failing health in those with Anorexia Nervosa. \n\nRed legs in individuals with Anorexia Nervosa can be a sign of a medical condition called purpura. Purpura occurs when small blood vessels under the skin break or leak blood, leading to purple or red spots on the skin. In individuals with Anorexia Nervosa, purpura can develop due to low levels of vitamin C, which is needed for maintaining the health of blood vessels. \n\nSince purpura indicates a significant health problem, it is safe to say that red legs are a sign of failing health in those with Anorexia Nervosa. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes."
