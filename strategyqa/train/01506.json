The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States, responsible for controlling the country's monetary policy and regulating banks. It has several branches located throughout the country, including one in Seattle. \n\nNext, we need to determine the location of the Space Needle. The Space Needle is a famous landmark located in Seattle, Washington - specifically, in the Lower Queen Anne neighborhood. \n\nNow we can answer the question. While both the Federal Reserve branch and the Space Needle are located in Seattle, they are not in the same neighborhood - in fact, they are several miles apart. According to Google Maps, the Federal Reserve branch (located at 1015 2nd Ave in downtown Seattle) is approximately 3.5 miles away from the Space Needle. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, the Federal Reserve is not a quick walk from the Space Needle."
