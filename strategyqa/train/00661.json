Cauliflower is a cool-season crop and requires a moderate to cool temperature to thrive. It grows best in temperatures ranging from 60\u00b0F to 65\u00b0F (15\u00b0C to 18\u00b0C) and can tolerate occasional frosts.\n\nNow, let's look at the given latitude of 75\u00b0 N. This latitude refers to an area in the Arctic region, which is characterized by long periods of darkness and cold temperatures throughout the year. In this region, there are harsh climatic conditions, including freezing temperatures, ice sheet formation, and months of continuous darkness. \n\nTherefore, it would not be suitable for a cauliflower farmer to grow the crop in such harsh climatic conditions. The vegetables that grow in this region are mainly root vegetables like carrots, radishes, potatoes, turnips, and beets, which can withstand such conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the climatic conditions prevailing in the region, the answer to the question is (B) No, a cauliflower farmer would not prosper at a latitude of 75\u00b0 N."

The equator is at 0\u00b0 latitude, and the North Pole is at 90\u00b0 N latitude.\n\nCauliflower is a cool-season crop that prefers temperatures between 60-65\u00b0F (15.5-18.3\u00b0C) for optimum growth. Farmers need to ensure that the weather is not too warm for cauliflower to grow successfully.\n\nA latitude of 75\u00b0 N is located above the Arctic Circle, meaning that it experiences long periods of darkness and extreme cold temperatures. Based on this, we can infer that it would be very difficult for a cauliflower farmer to prosper at this latitude. The climate is simply too cold and harsh for the crop to grow successfully.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, a cauliflower farmer would not prosper at a latitude of 75\u00b0 N."

It also requires full sun exposure and well-drained soil that is rich in organic matter.\n\nNext, we need to consider the latitude of 75\u00b0 N. This is a very high latitude, in fact, it is located within the Arctic Circle. This means that the amount of sunlight received by this location is extremely limited.

Additionally, the temperatures required for optimal growth are not likely to be consistently met in this region.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no.

Cauliflower is a cool-season crop that prefers temperatures between 60-65\u00b0F (15-18\u00b0C) and full sun exposure. \n\nNext, we need to look at the latitude. The closer a location is to the equator, the warmer the temperatures tend to be. Conversely, the further away a location is from the equator, the colder it tends to be. So, a latitude of 75\u00b0 N indicates that the location is very close to the North Pole, which means that it has a cold climate, with long winters and short summers.\n\nTherefore, based on our understanding of cauliflower's growing requirements, we can safely conclude that a cauliflower farmer would not be able to thrive and prosper at a latitude of 75\u00b0 N. The cold climate and short growing season would make it very difficult to grow cauliflower, and even if it were possible, the yield would likely be low and the quality of the crop may be compromised.

It needs a cool and moist environment with a temperature range of 15-20\u00b0 C. Now, when we talk about latitude, it is the angular distance of a place North or South of the equator. \n\nSo, a latitude of 75\u00b0 N tells us that the place is located 75 degrees North of the equator. At this latitude, we can assume that the temperature is colder compared to places located near the equator. The temperature may even reach below zero degrees Celsius. \n\nConsidering the environmental conditions required for growing cauliflower, we can say that a cauliflower farmer would not prosper at a latitude of 75\u00b0 N. The reason being, the temperature at this latitude may not support the growth of cauliflower plants, and hence the farmer may not be able to yield a substantial crop. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to this question is option (B) no."
