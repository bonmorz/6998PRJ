As of 2021, the Illuminati card game is not very popular. While it still has a small following of dedicated fans, it is no longer widely played or discussed. \n\nThere are a few reasons why the game may have fallen out of popularity. First, it is somewhat dated, and many of the conspiracies and events depicted on the cards are no longer relevant or well-known. Second, the game has been overshadowed by other popular card games, such as Cards Against Humanity, which have captured the attention and interest of players. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, the Illuminati card game is not currently popular."

It is a collectible card game created in the 1980s that features various conspiracies, secret societies, and supernatural elements. \n\nNext, we need to consider the popularity of the game. One way to do this is through internet search trends. If we search for \"Illuminati card game\" on Google Trends or other search engines, we can see that there is a significant drop in search interest for the game since its peak in the early 2000s. This suggests that the game is no longer as popular as it was before. Additionally, there are fewer people talking about the game in online forums and social media platforms. \n\nFinally, we can also look at sales data to confirm this observation. The game is still available for purchase online and in some game stores, but it is not as widely available as other popular games. This indicates that the game is no longer in high demand and is not as popular as it once was. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the Illuminati card game is no longer popular."
