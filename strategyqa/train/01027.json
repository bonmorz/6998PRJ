According to the official website of the New Mexico Secretary of State, \"To vote in the New Mexico Primary Election, you must be a registered voter affiliated with a major political party.\"\n\n2. Next, we need to consider whether the President of Mexico is a registered voter affiliated with a major political party in New Mexico. It is highly unlikely that the President of Mexico is a registered voter in New Mexico, as they are not a resident of the state and are not a citizen of the United States. \n\n3. Even if the President of Mexico were a registered voter in New Mexico, they would not be eligible to vote in the primaries as they are not a citizen of the United States and therefore do not meet the eligibility criteria.\n\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, the President of Mexico cannot vote in New Mexico primaries."
