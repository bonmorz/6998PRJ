Cucumbers, like all plants, need water to survive and thrive. They are typically grown in regions with adequate water supply and moderate temperatures. Since deserts have limited water sources, cucumbers are not often found growing in these regions. Therefore, answer (B) is correct - cucumbers are not often found in deserts."

They require ample water and sunlight to grow. Deserts have very little water and the hot temperatures can cause the leaves and vines to shrivel up quickly. Therefore, it is unlikely that cucumbers would be able to grow in the hot and arid conditions of a desert. Hence, the answer is (B) no."

A desert is a region that receives very little precipitation, usually less than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rainfall per year. \n\nNext, we need to consider the growing conditions for cucumbers. Cucumbers are a warm-season crop and require ample water and sunny weather to grow properly. They thrive in temperatures between 60 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit (15 and 32 degrees Celsius) and prefer well-drained soil that is rich in organic matter. \n\nBased on these two pieces of information, it is highly unlikely that cucumbers would be found in a desert. The hot and dry conditions aren't ideal for growing cucumbers, especially without ample water. While it is possible to grow cucumbers in a desert with irrigation and special provisions, it would not be common or widespread enough to say that cucumbers are often found in deserts. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
