The president after Wilson was Warren G. Harding, also a Republican. So we know that Wilson had a Republican president before him and after him. \n\nNext, we need to determine if being sandwiched by presidents of the opposing party means there was a president of a different party immediately before and after Wilson. If that is the case, the answer would be \"yes\". \n\nSo, we have already established that Taft (a Republican) was before Wilson. If we can confirm that Harding (also a Republican) was after Wilson, then Wilson would have indeed been sandwiched by presidents of the opposing party. \n\nLooking at the historical timeline, we can verify that Harding succeeded Wilson as president after the 1920 election, and that Harding was indeed a Republican. This means that Wilson was sandwiched between two presidents from the opposing party. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

So, we know that Taft and Harding were both Republicans.\nNext, we need to determine if Wilson, who was a Democrat, was sandwiched between these two presidents. To do this, we need to check if Taft served his full term before Wilson was elected and if Harding was elected after Wilson's term ended.\nWe know that Taft was president from 1909-1913, which means he served his full term before Wilson was elected in 1912. This means that Wilson was not sandwiched between Taft and Harding yet.\nFinally, we need to check if Harding was indeed elected after Wilson's term ended. Wilson served as president from 1913-1921, and Harding was elected in 1920. Therefore, Wilson was sandwiched between Taft and Harding, both of whom were from the opposing party. The answer is (A) yes."
