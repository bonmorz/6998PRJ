It refers to doing two jobs at the same time or performing two roles simultaneously. \n\nNow, let's look at the context of the question. The question is asking whether \"double duty\" is an incorrect phrase for the host of Dancing With The Stars. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider whether the host of Dancing With The Stars is performing two roles simultaneously. And the answer is yes - the host is responsible for both introducing and interviewing the contestants as well as guiding the show's proceedings. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no - \"double duty\" is an appropriate phrase for the host of Dancing With The Stars."

The statement is asking whether the phrase \"double duty\" is an incorrect way to describe the host of Dancing with the Stars. \n\nThe answer to this question is (B) no, it is not an incorrect phrase. This is because the host of Dancing with the Stars often performs multiple roles during the show. \n\nFor example, the host will introduce each dance routine, interview the contestants, and provide commentary throughout the show. In this way, the host is indeed performing \"double duty\" by taking on multiple roles.\n\nTherefore, the phrase \"double duty\" is an appropriate way to describe the host of Dancing with the Stars, and the correct answer is (B) no."

However, the question is asking if it is an \"incorrect\" phrase. \n\nThere is no grammatical error in the phrase \"double duty\" itself, so it cannot be said to be incorrect on that basis.

In the context of the question, it is referring to whether using the phrase \"double duty\" to describe the host of Dancing With The Stars is incorrect. \n\nTo answer the question, we need to consider whether using \"double duty\" accurately describes the role of the host on Dancing With The Stars. The host of the show, usually Tom Bergeron or Tyra Banks, is responsible for guiding the show, introducing the dancers and judges, and providing commentary throughout the episode. They are not performing another task simultaneously or in the same time period, so the phrase \"double duty\" is not an accurate description of their role. \n\nHowever, the question is asking if \"double duty\" is an incorrect phrase for the host of Dancing With The Stars. Even though it may not be the most accurate description, it is not necessarily incorrect. It is a common phrase used to describe someone who is taking on more than one role or responsibility at once, which the host may do in other parts of their career. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, \"double duty\" is not an incorrect phrase for the host of Dancing With The Stars."

In the context of Dancing With The Stars, it refers to the idea that the host of the show, Tom Bergeron, also hosted America's Funniest Home Videos at the same time.\n\nNow, the question is asking if \"double duty\" is an incorrect phrase to describe Tom Bergeron's role as host of Dancing With The Stars. The answer is no, because he did, in fact, host two shows at the same time, thus fulfilling the definition of \"double duty.\" Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.\n\nIt's important to note that some might argue that the term \"double duty\" is incorrect because Bergeron was not technically doing two roles on the same show but two different shows. However, this interpretation of \"double duty\" is too narrow, and the common usage of the phrase encompasses the idea of fulfilling two different roles simultaneously, regardless of whether they are on the same show or not."
