The Catholic Church usually considers individuals as saints who were Christians and have lived a life of exemplary character and holiness, performed miracles, and contributed to the spread of Christianity. Thus, since Tenzin Gyatso is not a Christian and has not promoted Christianity, the Catholic Church is unlikely to consider him a saint. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

Therefore, it is already improbable for the Catholic Church to consider the Dalai Lama as a saint due to religious differences. \n\nAdditionally, the process of canonization in the Catholic Church is quite rigorous and requires evidence of miracles attributed to the person being considered. As far as we know, there has been no official recognition of miracles associated with the Dalai Lama by the Catholic Church. Therefore, based on these factors, it is safe to assume that the Catholic Church will not consider Lhamo Thondup (the Dalai Lama) to be a saint. Therefore, Answer (B) is correct."

The Catholic Church recognizes individuals as saints based on their heroic virtue and their ability to perform miracles. \n\nConsidering these criteria, Lhamo Thondup may not be considered by the Catholic Church to be a saint because he is not a Catholic and does not follow Catholic teachings. Additionally, the Catholic Church typically does not consider individuals who are still alive to be saints, as they have not yet completed their earthly journey. \n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (B) no, Lhamo Thondup will not be considered by the Catholic Church to be a saint."
