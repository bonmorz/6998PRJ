A lawful arrest is an arrest that is made without any violation of the law, where the arresting officer has legal authority to take a person into custody.\n\nNow, coming to the question, it asks whether the members of The Police can perform lawful arrests. The Police is a popular rock band, and they are not law enforcement officers. Therefore, they do not have the legal authority to make arrests, which means the answer is no.\n\nLawful arrests can only be made by law enforcement officers who have been granted legal authority by their respective jurisdictions. This authority is usually derived from state or federal law and enables officers to take a person into custody, using reasonable force if necessary, in order to protect the community and ensure public safety.\n\nTherefore, since members of The Police are not law enforcement officers, they do not have the legal right to perform lawful arrests."
