In general, tax collectors need to have a good understanding of tax laws and regulations, as well as good communication skills and attention to detail. \n\nNext, we need to examine whether Kenny G meets those qualifications. Kenny G is a famous musician known for his saxophone skills. However, we do not have any information about his knowledge or experience in tax collection. \n\nGiven this lack of information, we cannot definitively say that Kenny G does not hold the qualifications to be a tax collector.
