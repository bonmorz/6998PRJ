A sell by date is a date stamped on a food product by the manufacturer or retailer indicating the last date the product should be sold. This date is not necessarily an expiration date, but rather an estimate of how long the product will remain at peak quality. \n\nNow, the question asks if the FDA requires sell by dates using Roman numerals. Roman numerals are a numerical system using letters from the Latin alphabet, such as I, II, III, IV, V, and so on. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to know whether the FDA has any specific requirements for the format of sell by dates. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the FDA requires sell by dates to be expressed using Roman numerals or any other particular numerical system. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no."

The FDA stands for the Food and Drug Administration, which is a government agency responsible for regulating food, drugs, medical devices, and other consumer products in the United States. \n\nNow let's consider the question. Does the FDA require sell by dates using Roman Numerals? To answer this question, we need to think about what sell by dates are and whether Roman Numerals are commonly used for them. \n\nSell by dates are labels that are put on food products to indicate the date by which the product should be sold. This date is determined by the manufacturer and is based on how long the product will stay fresh. The purpose of the sell by date is to ensure that consumers are buying fresh products and to help retailers manage their inventory.\n\nRoman Numerals, on the other hand, are a system of numerical notation that uses letters to represent numbers. This system was used in ancient Rome and is still used today for certain purposes, such as indicating the year in movie copyrights.\n\nSo, does the FDA require sell by dates using Roman Numerals? The answer is no. Sell by dates are typically written using Arabic numerals (the standard numeral system we use today) and are regulated by the FDA. Roman Numerals are not commonly used for sell by dates, as they could potentially confuse consumers and retailers who are not familiar with this numbering system."
