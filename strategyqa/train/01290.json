The Sea of Japan is located between the eastern coast of the Asian continent and the western coast of the Japanese islands. \n\nSecondly, does the Sea of Japan have any connection to the Pacific Ocean or other bodies of water? Yes, the Sea of Japan is connected to the Pacific Ocean through the Tsushima Strait. \n\nTherefore, the Sea of Japan cannot be landlocked within Japan since it is part of an oceanic body of water and has a connection to the Pacific Ocean. Hence, the correct answer is (B) no."

A landlocked body of water is completely surrounded by land and has no access to the ocean. \n\nBased on these definitions, we can determine that the Sea of Japan is not landlocked within Japan. While a portion of the Sea of Japan is bordered by Japan, it is not completely surrounded by Japan's land.
