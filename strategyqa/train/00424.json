While ants are highly social insects that communicate with each other through chemical signals and pheromones, they do not have a developed language system like humans or even apes. \n\nOn the other hand, apes - specifically primates like chimpanzees and bonobos - have been studied extensively for their language abilities.

Typically, language ability encompasses the ability to communicate using a symbolic system that includes grammar rules and vocabulary.\n\nNext, we need to compare the communication abilities of ants and apes. While ants do communicate with each other using pheromones and body language, it is generally agreed that their communication system is not as complex or extensive as that of apes. Apes, on the other hand, have been observed to use a wide range of vocalizations, gestures, and even sign language to communicate with each other.\n\nTherefore, based on our comparison of communication abilities, we can safely say that ants do not outperform apes on language ability. Answer (B) is correct."

Language ability refers to the capacity of individual organisms to communicate effectively through the use of language. In this case, the question is asking whether ants or apes are better at communicating through language. \n\nNext, we need to consider what we know about the language abilities of ants and apes. While it is true that ants have complex communication systems that involve chemicals called pheromones, these systems are not considered languages in the same way as human or ape languages. Ants are not capable of vocalizing or comprehending the complex symbolic representations that make up human language. \n\nOn the other hand, apes have been studied extensively for their language abilities, particularly in the case of chimpanzees who have been trained to use American Sign Language (ASL) and have demonstrated impressive levels of comprehension and communication. While the extent of ape language abilities is a debated topic, it is clear that they are much more advanced than those of ants. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, ants do not outperform apes on language ability."
