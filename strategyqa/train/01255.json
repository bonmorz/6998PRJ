Next, we need to understand what geologists do. Geologists study the physical properties and history of Earth, including rocks, minerals, and gemstones. Based on these definitions, we can see that a lapidary works with the same items studied by geologists, specifically gemstones. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

Geologists study the Earth's physical structure and substance, including rocks, minerals, and soil. \n\nNow, we can see that there is some overlap between the work of a lapidary and a geologist. Lapidaries work specifically with gemstones, which are a type of mineral. Geologists study minerals as well, so it is likely that a lapidary would work with items that are also studied by geologists. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."
