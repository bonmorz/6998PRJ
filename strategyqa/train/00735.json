It does not necessarily mean that it will snow. \n\nSnow occurs when there is precipitation in the form of frozen water molecules that fall to the ground. The presence of frost does not guarantee that there will be enough moisture in the air for snow to form. \n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (B) no."

Frost occurs when the temperature drops below freezing point (32\u00b0F or 0\u00b0C) and the moisture in the air freezes on surfaces such as the ground or plants. \n\nHowever, just because it's cold enough for frost doesn't necessarily mean it will snow. Snow requires moisture in the air to freeze into ice crystals and accumulate enough to fall to the ground. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, frost does not necessarily mean it will be a snowy day. It just means that the temperature is cold enough for the moisture in the air to freeze on surfaces."

Snow, on the other hand, is precipitation that falls from the sky in the form of ice crystals. While frost may indicate that the temperature is cold enough for snow, it does not necessarily mean that it will snow. Snow requires specific atmospheric conditions, including moisture in the air and a system to lift that moisture into the atmosphere to form clouds. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, frost does not mean that it will be a snowy day."

It usually happens on clear and calm nights when the temperature drops to or below freezing. However, frost does not necessarily mean that it will snow on the same day. \n\nSnow formation requires much more complicated atmospheric conditions than frost. It needs a sufficient amount of moisture, and the temperature at the ground level and up in the air has to be just right. If it's too warm, the snowflakes will melt, and if it's too cold, they won't form. \n\nTherefore, it's possible to have frosty conditions without snowfall. Conversely, it's also possible to have a snowy day without frost. Therefore the answer is (B) no."
