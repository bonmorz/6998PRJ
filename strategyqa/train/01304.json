Shrimp scampi is a popular Italian-American dish that is typically made with shrimp, butter, garlic, white wine, and lemon juice.\n\nNow, the question is whether shrimp scampi is definitely free of plastic. The answer is no, it is not.\n\nThere are a few reasons why shrimp scampi may contain plastic:\n\n1. Shrimp: The primary ingredient in shrimp scampi is shrimp, and unfortunately, many shrimp are caught and farmed in ways that involve plastic pollution. For example, nets used to catch shrimp can break down into microplastics that can end up in the shrimp.\n\n2. Packaging: Shrimp scampi often comes in packaging, such as plastic containers or bags, which can contribute to plastic pollution.\n\n3. Utensils: If you order shrimp scampi from a restaurant or get it to-go, you may receive utensils made of plastic, which can contribute to plastic pollution.\n\nSo, in conclusion, shrimp scampi is not definitely free of plastic. However, there are ways to reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in your shrimp scampi, such as choosing sustainably-sourced shrimp, reducing packaging waste, and using reusable utensils."
