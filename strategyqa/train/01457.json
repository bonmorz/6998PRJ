This cycle is also known as the Krebs cycle or the citric acid cycle.\n\nWatermelon does contain citrulline which is converted into arginine in our body. Arginine is an amino acid that is involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, watermelon doesn't contain large amounts of citrulline.\n\nTherefore, it is safe for people with a tricarboxylic acid allergy to consume watermelon as the amount of citrulline in watermelon is relatively low and not sufficient to cause an allergic reaction. Hence, the answer is (A) yes, watermelon is safe for people with a tricarboxylic acid allergy."

Tricarboxylic acids, also known as citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle, are a series of chemical reactions that occur in our body to release energy from food. It is unlikely for someone to be allergic to tricarboxylic acid as it is a naturally occurring substance in the human body. However, some people may have sensitivities or intolerances to it. \n\nNext, we need to examine whether watermelon contains tricarboxylic acid. Watermelon is a fruit that is high in water content and contains carbohydrates, sugars, vitamins, and minerals. It does contain citric acid, which is a type of tricarboxylic acid, but in a very small amount. \n\nTherefore, for someone with a tricarboxylic acid sensitivity or intolerance, eating watermelon is generally safe as the amount of citric acid in watermelon is not significant enough to cause a reaction. Hence, the correct answer is (A) yes."
