The treaty imposed severe penalties on Germany, including the loss of territory and the payment of reparations.\n\nNext, we can consider the idea of settling the treaty over blueberry scones. This seems unlikely, as the negotiations for the treaty took place in Versailles, France, and involved representatives from many countries. It is unlikely that the settlement of such an important treaty would be decided over a casual snack.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, the Treaty of Versailles was not settled over blueberry scones."

This means the question is asking if blueberry scones played a role in the settlement of the treaty. \n\nThere is no evidence or historical record to suggest that blueberry scones were involved in any way in the settlement of the Treaty of Versailles. The negotiations for the treaty took place over several months, involving various meetings and discussions among representatives from different countries. The terms of the treaty were based on a combination of political, economic, and military factors, which had nothing to do with blueberry scones. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, blueberry scones did not play a role in the settlement of the Treaty of Versailles."

The answer is clearly (B) no, as there is no mention of blueberry scones in any historical account of the treaty. The Treaty of Versailles was a significant event in world history, and it was decided through complex negotiations and discussions between the delegates of the Allied Powers and Germany. Therefore, it is important to focus on the relevant details and historical facts when answering questions like these."
