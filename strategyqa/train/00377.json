Therefore, a team could have around 10-13 players. \n\nWe don't know the exact number of ex-wives Larry King has, but we know he has had at least two. If both of his ex-wives had seven friends who could play water polo, then they could form a team. \n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, Larry King's ex-wives could form a water polo team."

The answer is yes because there is no regulation or rule in water polo that prohibits ex-wives from forming a team. As long as they have enough players and follow the rules of the game, they can form a team and play water polo."
