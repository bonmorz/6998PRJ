Thus, it is highly unlikely that watermelons, a warm-weather fruit, are grown there. Brazil, on the other hand, is a tropical country with a warm climate and is known for producing and exporting many types of fruits, including watermelons. Therefore, it is safe to assume that more watermelons are grown in Brazil than in Antarctica, making the answer (A) yes."

It's highly unlikely to grow watermelons in such a harsh environment, so we can eliminate option (B) \"no\". \n\nNext, we need to consider if Brazil is a major producer of watermelons. According to recent statistics, Brazil is among the top five countries in the world for watermelon production, with millions of tons harvested annually. So, option (A) \"yes\" is a likely choice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) \"yes,\" as it's highly probable that more watermelons are grown in Brazil than in Antarctica."

On the other hand, Antarctica is a frozen continent with harsh climatic conditions, making it unsuitable for watermelon cultivation.\n\nNext, we need to compare the agricultural output of both regions. Brazil is known to be one of the significant producers of watermelons globally, with its agricultural sector contributing significantly to the country's economy. On the other hand, Antarctica has no agriculture due to its harsh environment and lack of soil suitable for crops.\n\nConsidering these facts, it is safe to say that more watermelons are grown in Brazil than in Antarctica. Thus, the answer is (A) yes."
