The atomic number of nickel is 28, while the atomic number of mercury is 80.\n\nThe question asks if nickel is a better payout than mercury if given a dollar per atomic number. This means that we need to compare how much money we get for each atomic number of each element.\n\nTo do this, we divide $1 by the atomic number of each element. For nickel, this is $1/28 = $0.0357 per atomic number. For mercury, $1/80 = $0.0125 per atomic number.\n\nTherefore, we can see that nickel actually has a lower payout than mercury - we get less money per atomic number with nickel.\n\nThus, the correct answer is (B) no - nickel is not a better payout than mercury."

In this case, we are comparing nickel and mercury.\n\nSecondly, we need to understand the atomic numbers of these two elements. The atomic number of nickel is 28, while the atomic number of mercury is 80.\n\nNow, the question asks if nickel is a better payout than mercury if given a dollar per atomic number. This means we have to divide the given dollar equally among each atomic number of the respective elements and compare which one gives higher value.\n\nSo, if we divide one dollar equally between each atomic number of nickel, we get 1/28 dollars per atomic number. Similarly, if we divide one dollar equally between each atomic number of mercury, we get 1/80 dollars per atomic number.\n\nComparing these values, we can see that 1/28 is greater than 1/80. Therefore, nickel gives a higher payout than mercury if we only consider the atomic number. However, the question asks whether nickel is a better payout than mercury given a dollar per atomic number. Hence, we must compare the two values we got in the previous step in terms of dollars.\n\nMultiplying the atomic number by the respective value per atomic number, we get:\n\nNickel: 1/28 * 28 = 1 dollar\nMercury: 1/80 * 80 = 1 dollar\n\nHence, both nickel and mercury give the same payout of 1 dollar if given a dollar per atomic number. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no."
