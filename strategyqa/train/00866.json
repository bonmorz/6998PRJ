A misnomer is a term or name that is mistakenly or inaccurately applied to something. \n\nNext, we need to consider the Hundred Years' War. This was a series of military conflicts between England and France that lasted from 1337 to 1453. \n\nThe name \"Hundred Years' War\" suggests that it was a continuous and prolonged conflict lasting for 100 years, but this is not entirely accurate. There were long periods of truce and peace negotiations during this time, and the conflict was not always between England and France. Other countries and regions were also involved, such as Scotland, Burgundy, and the kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula. \n\nTherefore, it can be argued that the name \"Hundred Years' War\" is a misnomer, as it does not accurately describe the nature and scope of the conflict.
