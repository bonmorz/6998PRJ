Drow is a fantasy race in Dungeons & Dragons, which is typically depicted as tall and slender with dark skin and white hair. Based on this description, we can assume that a Drow is taller than an average human being.\n\nNext, we need to consider the height of The Hobbit's hero, which is Bilbo Baggins. In the book, it is mentioned that Bilbo is a hobbit, which is a race of human-like creatures with short stature. The average height of a hobbit is around 3 to 4 feet.\n\nBased on these facts, we can conclude that a Drow would tower over Bilbo Baggins. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes."

A Hobbit, on the other hand, is a fictional character from J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth world, known for their small stature.\n\nNext, we can infer from the question that the height of the two characters is being compared. The term \"tower over\" suggests that one character is significantly taller than the other.\n\nWe know that Drows are typically much taller than Hobbits. Therefore, it is likely that a Drow would tower over The Hobbit's hero. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."
