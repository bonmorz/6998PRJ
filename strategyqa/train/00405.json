In the context of Marvel comics, it would mean an animal or creature that is depicted as having human-like traits or abilities. \n\nNext, we need to determine if a sable was depicted in Marvel comics. A sable is a type of animal, specifically a small carnivorous mammal. \n\nAfter researching Marvel comics, we can conclude that a sable was indeed depicted in their comics but it was not anthropomorphic. The sable in question is actually a character named Darkstar (Laynia Petrovna) who possesses the ability to manipulate darkforce energy. She adopted the codename \"Sable\" but it was not because she was depicted as a sable, a humanoid or an animal with anthropomorphic traits.  \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Was the sable depicted in Marvel comics anthropomorphic?\" is (B) no."
