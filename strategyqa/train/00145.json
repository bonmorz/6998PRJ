According to the Bible, Noah was a righteous man who was instructed by God to build an ark to save himself, his family, and a pair of every kind of animal from a great flood. Now, coming to the dove. After the floodwaters receded, Noah released a dove from the ark to see if the waters had receded enough for the bird to find a place to settle. The dove flew back to Noah, indicating that it could not find a place to settle. So, Noah waited for a week and released the dove again. This time the dove returned with an olive branch, a sign that the floodwaters had indeed receded, and a place for the bird to rest had emerged. This event is captured in Genesis 8:8-11, which clearly establishes the association between Noah and the dove. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, Noah was indeed associated with a dove."

After the floodwaters receded and the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat, Noah wanted to find out if the land had dried up yet. So, he sent out a raven to see if it could find dry land, but it just flew back and forth until the waters had completely receded from the earth. \n\nThen, Noah sent out a dove to check if the water had subsided. After flying around for a while, the dove returned with an olive leaf in its beak, indicating that the water had receded from the earth. Noah waited for another seven days and sent out the dove again, and it didn't come back, which meant the land was completely dry. So, the answer to the question is yes, Noah was associated with a dove."

A dove is a bird often associated with peace, love, and hope. In the Bible, a dove is also associated with being a symbol of the Holy Spirit. \n\nSo, to answer the question, we need to know if there is any mention of Noah being associated with a dove in the Bible. In the book of Genesis, chapter 8, verse 8-12, it is written that after the flood, Noah released a dove from the ark to see if it had found dry land. The dove returned to the ark, so Noah waited another seven days and released the dove again. This time the dove returned with an olive leaf in its beak, indicating that there was dry land. Noah waited another seven days and released the dove again, and it didn't return. This indicated to Noah that the flood had receded and the earth was once again inhabitable. \n\nTherefore, since Noah did release a dove and it played a significant role in the story of the flood, the answer is (A) yes, Noah was associated with a dove."
