Sasha Obama is the younger daughter of Barack and Michelle Obama, who served as the 44th President and First Lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017.\n\nNext, we need to consider whether John Lennon and Sasha Obama could have been friends. We know that John Lennon died in 1980, which was decades before Sasha Obama was born in 2001. Therefore, it is impossible for them to have been friends since they did not live in the same time period.\n\nFinally, we can conclude that the answer is (B) no, John Lennon was not known to be a friend to Sasha Obama since they did not live in the same time period."
