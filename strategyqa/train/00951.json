Once we know the location, we can look for information about the official bird of that city. One way to do this is to search online for a list of official city birds or search for information about the city's symbols or emblems. \n\nAssuming that we have found information that LG Electronics is located in a city, we can cross-check whether the city has an official bird with a purplish/blue tail. We can search for images or descriptions of the official bird or look for information about the bird's physical characteristics. If we find that the bird has a purplish/blue tail, then the answer to the question is yes, and if not, then the answer is no.\n\nTherefore, based on the above steps, if we have found information that LG Electronics is located in a city with an official bird that has a purplish/blue tail, then the answer to the question is yes (A), and if we have found otherwise, then the answer is no (B)."

LG Electronics is a multinational electronics company with multiple locations worldwide, including manufacturing plants and offices. \n\nTo narrow down our search, we need to find out if LG Electronics has any major locations in the United States, where most cities have official birds. A quick search online reveals that LG Electronics has a North American headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. \n\nThe next step is to find out if Englewood Cliffs has an official bird. We can do this by searching for the city's official website or by browsing online bird guides. We quickly discover that Englewood Cliffs' official bird is the Eastern Bluebird, known for its vibrant blue feathers and reddish-brown chest. \n\nBut does this bird have a purplish/blue tail? Again, we can turn to online bird guides to confirm our answer. We find that while the Eastern Bluebird is mostly blue, its tail feathers are actually a deep blue or blue-black color, which could be interpreted as purplish or bluish. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that LG Electronics is located in a city with an official bird that has a purplish/blue tail, making answer (A) \"yes\" the correct choice."
