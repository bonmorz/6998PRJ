According to public records, Eddie Murphy has 10 children. \n\nNext, we need to know the dimensions of a standard basketball court. A standard basketball court is 94 feet long by 50 feet wide, or 4,700 square feet. \n\nTo determine if Eddie Murphy's children could hypothetically fill a basketball court by themselves, we need to calculate their collective size. However, we don't have enough information about the age and size of each child to calculate an exact number. \n\nAssuming that each child takes up a minimum of 4 square feet (roughly the size of a folded beach towel), Eddie Murphy's 10 children would take up a minimum of 40 square feet. \n\nSince a basketball court is 4,700 square feet, Eddie Murphy's children would not only be able to hypothetically fill a basketball court, but they would barely take up 1% of the total space. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

This will depend on how closely they stand next to each other. For example, if they each stand in their own corner of the court, they will occupy more square footage per person than if they stand shoulder to shoulder. \n\nLet's assume they stand shoulder to shoulder, which would give each person about 4 square feet of space (4,700 square feet divided by 10 children = 470 square feet per child). \n\nTherefore, if each child takes up 4 square feet, and they have a total of 10 children, they would occupy 40 square feet collectively (4 square feet x 10 children = 40 square feet). \n\nSince the basketball court has a total of 4,700 square feet, and the children only occupy 40 square feet, we can see that they could hypothetically fill the basketball court by themselves.

According to the National Basketball Association (NBA), a basketball court is 94 feet long and 50 feet wide. \n\nNext, we need to determine the number of children Eddie Murphy has. According to his public profile, Eddie Murphy has 10 children.\n\nTo determine whether his children could fill a basketball court by themselves, we need to find out how much space each child would occupy. We can start by assuming that each child's average wingspan is approximately equal to their height, which is the case for most humans. So, we can estimate that each child would occupy a space of approximately 6 feet by 2.5 feet (94 feet divided by 10 children = 9.4 feet, which we can round down to 9 feet per child. 50 feet divided by 2 = 25 feet, which we can round up to 25 feet per child. So, each child would occupy a space of approximately 9 feet by 2.5 feet). \n\nMultiplying these dimensions together, we find that each child would occupy 15 square feet of space. \n\nNow, to determine whether his children could fill the basketball court, we need to calculate the total available space on the court. This can be done by multiplying the length and width of the court together: 94 feet x 50 feet = 4,700 square feet. \n\nFinally, we can divide the total available space on the court by the space each child would occupy to determine the maximum number of children that could fit. 4,700 square feet divided by 15 square feet per child equals approximately 313 children. \n\nSince Eddie Murphy has only 10 children, it is safe to say that they could hypothetically fill a basketball court by themselves. Thus, the correct answer is (A) yes."
