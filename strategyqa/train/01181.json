While many crustaceans do indeed live in the ocean, it's important to note that not all of them do. For example, some crab species like the robber crab live on land, while others such as fresh water crayfish, live in freshwater habitats. Additionally, some shrimp species can be found in freshwater or brackish environments. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, not all crustaceans live in the ocean."

While many crustaceans are indeed found in the ocean, there are also crustaceans that live in freshwater and on land. For example, some species of crayfish and crabs can be found in freshwater habitats such as rivers and lakes.

Crustaceans are a large group of arthropods that includes crabs, lobsters, shrimps, and barnacles, among others. \n\nNext, we need to determine if all crustaceans live in the ocean. To do this, we can research where crustaceans are commonly found. While many crustaceans do live in the ocean, there are also many species of crustaceans that live in freshwater environments like streams, lakes, and rivers. For example, crawfish or freshwater shrimp are crustaceans that live in freshwater habitats. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, not all crustaceans live in the ocean."

Although many crustaceans do live in the ocean, not all of them do. Some crustaceans are adapted to live in fresh water, such as crayfish and certain types of shrimp. Others can be found in a variety of habitats, including on land (such as terrestrial hermit crabs) and in brackish water (such as some types of crabs and shrimp).\n3.
