The Grammy Award is a prestigious music award, given annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences to recognize outstanding achievements in the music industry. \n\nStep 1: Research Bach's Lifetime and Grammys' History\nFirst, we need to check if Johann Sebastian Bach was alive during the Grammy Awards' establishment. The Grammy Awards were first presented in 1959, while Bach lived in the 17th and 18th centuries. It is impossible for Bach to win a Grammy Award because he would be deceased several centuries before the establishment of the ceremony. \n\nStep 2: Examine awards granted posthumously\nIt is also possible for artists to be awarded Grammys posthumously. However, Bach died in 1750, long before the inception of the Grammys. Therefore, he is not eligible for any posthumous awards. \n\nConclusion:\nConsidering the information above, we can safely conclude that Johann Sebastian Bach never won a Grammy Award."

While there have been recordings of Bach's music that have won Grammy Awards, these awards went to the performers and producers of the recordings, not to Bach himself. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, Johann Sebastian Bach did not win a Grammy Award."
