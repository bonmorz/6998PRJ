In fact, their rowing team is quite successful and competes at the Division I level. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is no, students would not have to petition to get a rowing team at Marist College because they already have one."

In this case, the question is asking if students at Marist would need to submit a formal written request to start a rowing team. \n\nTo answer the question, we need to consider the resources and policies of Marist. Does Marist have the necessary resources for a rowing team, such as access to a body of water and boats? Does Marist have a policy against adding new sports teams? \n\nAssuming that Marist has the necessary resources and does not have a policy against adding new sports teams, then students would not need to petition to start a rowing team. Instead, students could potentially reach out to the athletics department or student government to express their interest and work towards creating a new team. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no - students at Marist would not have to petition to get a rowing team, as long as the necessary resources and policies are in place."

Marist could refer to a university, college, or high school, so we should research which Marist specifically is being referred to. Assuming the Marist being referenced is a college or university, we can then look at their athletics program to determine if they currently have a rowing team. If they do not have a rowing team, potential factors that may determine if a team can be established could be the level of interest from current students, if the school has the necessary equipment and facilities, and if there are available coaches. Ultimately, whether or not students at Marist would need to petition for a rowing team would depend on the policies and procedures of that specific institution. However, based on the information given in the question, we could not reasonably assume that a petition would be required without further context. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, students at Marist would not necessarily have to petition to get a rowing team."

Therefore, it's possible that Marist may already have a rowing team. The answer to this question may depend on whether the school already has a rowing team. But assuming that Marist currently does not have a rowing team, the question asks whether students would have to petition for one. \n\nPetitioning for a sports team typically means that students would have to gather support from other students, faculty, and possibly even community members to convince the school to consider adding the sport. This could involve presenting a proposal to the school's administration, highlighting the benefits of having a rowing team, such as increased school spirit, athletic opportunities for students, and potential revenue from competitions. \n\nHowever, in the case of Marist, it's possible that the school already has a process in place for proposing and adding new sports teams. They may have a specific department or committee in charge of athletics who would evaluate the feasibility of adding a rowing team. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, students at Marist would not have to petition to get a rowing team because the process for adding a new sports team may already exist."

If they do not have a rowing team already, it is unlikely that students would need to petition to start one. This is because most colleges and universities encourage student involvement in clubs and activities, and starting a new club or organization is usually as simple as finding a faculty advisor and submitting paperwork to the school.\n\nAccording to the answer provided, students at Marist would not need to petition to start a rowing team. This means that they could likely start one with the support of the school administration and faculty. It is always possible that there may be additional requirements or processes to follow, but a formal petition is likely not necessary."

In this case, the question is asking whether students at Marist College would need to create a petition to get a rowing team. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to look for clues in the given information. The name \"Marist\" suggests that we are dealing with a college or university. Rowing is a sport that requires a body of water, such as a river or lake. \n\nKnowing this, we can infer that whether or not students at Marist need to petition for a rowing team depends on whether or not the college has access to a body of water suitable for rowing. \n\nIf Marist has access to a suitable body of water, then it is likely that the college already has a rowing team or would not require a petition to create one. On the other hand, if Marist does not have access to a suitable body of water, then it is likely that students would need to petition for the college to create a rowing team.\n\nWithout any additional information, we cannot determine whether or not Marist has a rowing team or whether students would need to petition for one. However, based on the given question, the answer is (B) no, which suggests that the assumption is that Marist either has a rowing team or would not require a petition to create one."
