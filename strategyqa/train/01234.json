The 1936 Summer Olympics were held in Berlin, Germany, and the main stadium was the Olympiastadion. \n\nNext, we need to consider the capacity of the Olympiastadion. The stadium was initially built to hold 100,000 spectators, but after renovations in the 1970s, its capacity was reduced to around 74,000. \n\nNow, let's turn our attention to the Superbowl. The Superbowl is an annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL) in the United States. It is one of the most-watched sporting events in the world and typically draws a massive audience. \n\nThe largest crowd to attend a Superbowl was in 1980, when 103,985 people watched the game at the Rose Bowl in California. However, most modern stadiums that host the Superbowl have capacities of around 70,000 to 80,000 spectators. \n\nTherefore, based on this information, we can conclude that the 1936 Summer Olympics venue, the Olympiastadion, is not too small for a Superbowl crowd. Its maximum capacity is comparable to many modern Superbowl venues, and it has hosted events with similar-sized audiences in the past. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

The average attendance for a Superbowl is around 74,000. This means that the Olympic Stadium, with its seating capacity of 110,000, is more than large enough to accommodate a Superbowl crowd. \n\nBased on these facts, we can conclude that the answer to the question is (B) no, the 1936 Summer Olympics venue is not too small for a Superbowl crowd."

In fact, it would have enough room to spare for additional seating and viewing areas. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, the 1936 Summer Olympics venue is not too small for a Superbowl crowd."
