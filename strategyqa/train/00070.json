A lifeboat is a small, sturdy boat designed to rescue people who are stranded in the water. It is typically used in cases of emergency, such as when a ship is sinking or when people are stranded in the sea.\n\nSo, the question is asking whether it is possible for a lifeboat to rescue people in the Hooke Sea. Without any additional information about the Hooke Sea, it is impossible to answer this question definitively. Therefore, we cannot say with certainty whether a lifeboat would be capable of rescuing people in the Hooke Sea.\n\nTherefore, option (B) no is the correct answer."

However, it is important to note that there is no real place called the \"Hooke Sea.\" It is likely a hypothetical location or a misspelling of a real sea. Assuming that the intended location is actually the \"Hook Sea\" in Australia, we can proceed with the analysis.\n\nA lifeboat is typically used for rescuing individuals from bodies of water such as oceans, lakes, and rivers. However, whether or not a lifeboat could be used to rescue people in the Hook Sea depends on a few factors. The Hook Sea is located in Australia, so we need to consider the climate, weather, and other environmental factors that could affect a rescue mission.\n\nAssuming that the conditions in the Hook Sea are conducive to the use of a lifeboat, it is still possible that a lifeboat may not be able to rescue people in distress in all situations. For example, if the sea is experiencing strong waves, high winds, or a severe storm, a lifeboat may not be able to reach and rescue the people in need.\n\nTherefore, without knowing more details about the specific conditions in the Hook Sea at the time of the potential rescue mission, we cannot definitively answer this question. However, given that the question does not provide any additional information, the safest answer is to choose option (B) no, since there is no guarantee that a lifeboat would be able to rescue people in the Hook Sea under all circumstances."

Thus, we can assume that the Hooke Sea is a fictional location.\n\nNext, we should consider the purpose and capabilities of a lifeboat. Lifeboats are typically used for rescue purposes in emergency situations such as shipwrecks or natural disasters like floods or hurricanes. They are designed to be stable, self-righting, and have a high freeboard to prevent capsizing. They are also equipped with basic supplies such as food, water, and medical kits.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that a lifeboat cannot rescue people in a fictional location like the Hooke Sea that does not exist in reality. Hence, the correct answer is (B) no."
