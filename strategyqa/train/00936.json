The 14th president of the United States was Franklin Pierce, who served from 1853 to 1857. Kant died in 1804, so he could not have met Pierce during his presidency. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

Immanuel Kant lived from 1724 to 1804, while the 14th president of the United States, Franklin Pierce, served from 1853 to 1857. This means that there is a significant gap between Kant's lifetime and Pierce's presidency.\n\nSecond, we have to consider the geography of the situation. Immanuel Kant was a German philosopher who spent most of his life in K\u00f6nigsberg (modern-day Kaliningrad), which is located in present-day Russia. Franklin Pierce, on the other hand, was based mainly in New Hampshire and Washington, D.C. during his presidency.\n\nBased on these two pieces of information - the timeline and the geography - it seems highly unlikely that Immanuel Kant ever met the 14th president of the United States. While there is a slim possibility that Kant and Pierce could have crossed paths during Pierce's travels or Kant's lifetime, it is not a documented or even plausible scenario. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no."
