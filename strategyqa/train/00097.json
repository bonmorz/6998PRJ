Therefore, we can assume that he has been analyzed and observed by media professionals and the public. \n\nNext, the question asks whether Glenn Beck is known for his mild temper. This means that we need to consider whether media reports, public opinion, or personal accounts suggest that Glenn Beck is known to have a mild temper. \n\nHowever, from the known history of Glenn Beck's public statements, he is known to have a provocative and opinionated style. He has been known to voice strong opinions and engage in controversial topics. This suggests that the answer is (B) no, Glenn Beck is not known for his mild temper. \n\nTherefore, we can understand that the question is not focusing on whether Glenn Beck is necessarily a good or bad person, but is examining whether his personality traits are generally mild or not.
