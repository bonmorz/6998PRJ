Los Angeles is in the Pacific Time Zone, while Basel is in the Central European Time Zone. This means that there is a time difference between the two cities, and when it is daytime in Los Angeles, it may be nighttime in Basel.\n\nNext, we need to consider the geographical position of the two cities. Los Angeles is located in southern California, in the western part of the United States, while Basel is located in northwestern Switzerland, in central Europe.\n\nGiven these facts, it is safe to say that it is dark in Basel during the day in Los Angeles. This is because when it is daytime in Los Angeles, it is likely nighttime in Basel due to the time difference and geographical position.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes - it is dark in Basel during the day in Los Angeles."

Therefore, when it is daytime in Los Angeles, it is nighttime in Basel. \n\nNow, let's think about the question asked. It is asking if it is dark in Basel during the day in Los Angeles. Since the daytime in Los Angeles is the nighttime in Basel, it is reasonable to assume that it would be dark in Basel during this time. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, it is dark in Basel during the day in Los Angeles."

So, if it is daytime in Los Angeles, then it must be dark in Basel at that same time. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, it is dark in Basel during the day in Los Angeles."

So, yes, it is dark in Basel during the day in Los Angeles. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes."

This means that it is nighttime in Basel. Therefore, it is dark in Basel during the day in Los Angeles, which means the correct answer is (A) yes. \n\nTo understand this concept better, we can imagine that the earth is divided into 24 different time zones, each separated by an hour's time difference. Since Los Angeles is in the Pacific Time Zone, the sun will hit that region first, followed by a gradual shift towards the eastern time zones, which means that by the time it is daytime in Los Angeles, it will be nighttime in Basel."
