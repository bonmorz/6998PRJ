Second, we know that paratroopers use parachutes to slow their descent and land safely on the ground. However, parachutes require air to be effective, as they use air resistance to slow down the fall. In a vacuum, there is no air, and therefore, the parachute will not work. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, paratroopers cannot be used in a vacuum."

The parachute slows their descent and allows them to land safely on the ground. \n\nIn a vacuum, there is no air resistance, which means there is no air for the parachute to interact with. Without air resistance, the parachute cannot slow down the paratrooper's descent. This means that a paratrooper jumping in a vacuum would fall to the ground at the same rate as an unaided object, which would be fatal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no. Paratroopers cannot be used in a vacuum because their parachutes would not work in the absence of air resistance."

In a vacuum, there is no air resistance to slow them down. Therefore, they would fall at freefall velocity and would not have any control over their landing. \nSecondly, paratroopers need to have a supply of oxygen to breathe during their descent and afterward. In a vacuum, there is no atmosphere which means there is no oxygen to breathe, making it impossible for them to survive. \nFinally, paratroopers also require a pressurized environment to function properly because their bodies are designed to function in earth's atmosphere. Without pressure, their bodies would experience extreme conditions that could lead to severe injuries or death. \nConsidering all these factors, it is evident that paratroopers cannot be used in a vacuum, and the answer is (B) no."
