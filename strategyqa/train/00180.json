A baby gray whale can weigh up to 1.5 tons and can be up to 16 feet long. \n\nNext, we need to know the size of a typical tractor-trailer. A standard tractor-trailer is around 53 feet long and 8.5 feet wide. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that a baby gray whale can fit inside a tractor-trailer. Even though a baby gray whale can be up to 16 feet long, it is not wider than 8.5 feet, so it can fit inside a standard trailer. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

According to National Geographic, a newborn gray whale can measure anywhere from 13-16 feet (4-4.9 meters) in length and weigh up to 1,500 pounds (680 kg). \nNext, we need to consider the size of a typical tractor-trailer. Standard tractor-trailers have an interior height of about 110 inches (2.8 meters), an interior width of about 96 inches (2.4 meters), and an interior length of about 53 feet (16 meters). \nBased on these measurements, it seems like a baby gray whale could fit in a tractor-trailer. However, we also need to consider any potential obstacles or challenges in transporting a live whale, including the need for water, ventilation, and specialized equipment."

The length and height of the tractor-trailer are more than enough to fit a baby gray whale, and the width is also sufficient as a baby gray whale would be slimmer than a fully grown gray whale.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a baby gray whale is born with a length of about 14-16 feet (4.3-4.9 meters) and weighs around 1,100-1,500 pounds (500-680 kilograms).\n\nNext, we need to know the size of a standard tractor-trailer. According to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), a standard tractor-trailer can be up to 53 feet (16.15 meters) long, 8.5 feet (2.6 meters) wide, and 13.5 feet (4.1 meters) high. It can also carry up to 80,000 pounds (36,287 kilograms) of weight.\n\nNow, let's compare the size of a baby gray whale to that of a tractor-trailer. From the above information, we can see that the length and width of the tractor-trailer are definitely larger than the length and width of a baby gray whale. However, the height of the tractor-trailer is only slightly larger than the height of a baby gray whale.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, it would be safe to conclude that a baby gray whale would fit in a tractor-trailer. However, we should note that it would not be a humane or ethical practice to transport a live animal in such a way, and it is important to prioritize the welfare and rights of all living beings."
