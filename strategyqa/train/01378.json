However, for the purpose of this question, we will use the median price of $23,500. \n\nNext, we need to determine the value of a single bitcoin. As of the time of writing, the value of bitcoin is fluctuating constantly, but for the purpose of this question, we will use a value of $10,000 per bitcoin. \n\nTo determine if a single bitcoin could cover the cost of a Volkswagen Jetta, we need to divide the price of the car by the value of a bitcoin. \n\n$23,500 / $10,000 = 2.35\n\nThis calculation shows that it would require 2.35 bitcoins to cover the cost of a Volkswagen Jetta. As a single bitcoin has a value of $10,000, it is certainly possible for a single bitcoin to cover the cost of a Volkswagen Jetta. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."
