Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, weakness, and even kidney damage in severe cases.\n\nNext, we need to understand if basil contains vitamin D. According to various sources, including the USDA, basil does not contain significant amounts of vitamin D.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that basil is safe from Hypervitaminosis D, as it does not contain high levels of vitamin D. Hence, the correct answer is (A) yes."
