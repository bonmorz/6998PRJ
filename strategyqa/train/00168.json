The Constitution of the United States mandates that a person must be at least 35 years old to become President of the United States. \nNext, we need to determine the age of a student in eleventh grade. The typical age range for eleventh-grade students is 16-17 years old. \nTherefore, a student in eleventh grade will not meet the minimum age requirement to run for the presidency, since they are not yet 35 years old. \nHence, the correct answer is (A) yes, a student in eleventh grade would be unable to run for the presidency of the United States."
