Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

Tonsure is the practice of shaving or cutting off the hair on the scalp, especially as a religious rite or custom. \n\nSo, if someone has undergone tonsure, it means that they have had their head shaved or the hair on their scalp cut off. Therefore, the answer to this question would be no - a person using tonsure would not have hair at the top of their scalp because it has been purposely removed. \n\nIn other words, tonsure involves removing all or most of the hair from the top of the scalp, leaving only a small area sometimes known as a tonsure patch or crown. This is usually done for religious or cultural reasons, and it is not usually done for aesthetic purposes. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to this question is (B) no."

Tonsure is a traditional practice in which a person's hair is shaved or cut off, usually for religious or cultural reasons. \n\nNext, we need to consider where on the scalp the hair is shaved. Tonsure typically involves shaving a specific area of the scalp, often near the back or sides, leaving only a small patch or ring of hair. \n\nTherefore, based on these two pieces of information, we can conclude that a person using tonsure does not have hair at the top of their scalp. The hair is typically only left in a specific area, while the rest of the head is shaved or cut. \n\nSo the answer is (B) no, a person using tonsure does not have hair at the top of their scalp."
