According to the World Bank, as of 2020, the population of France is approximately 67 million people. \n\nNext, we need to determine the number of Jonny Cash records available in the world. This may be difficult to determine, but we can estimate that there have been millions of copies of his albums sold worldwide. \n\nTo simplify the math, let's assume that there are exactly 67 million Jonny Cash records in the world (one for each French citizen).

According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Johnny Cash has over 121 million certified album sales in the United States alone.
