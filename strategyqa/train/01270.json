A jackfruit is a large, tropical fruit that can weigh up to 80 pounds. \n\nNext, we need to consider the force at which the jackfruit is thrown. If it is thrown with a significant amount of force, it could cause serious harm to the person's head. \n\nFurthermore, the outer layer of a jackfruit is covered in small, prickly bumps that could also cause injury upon impact.\n\nTherefore, it is not safe to have a jackfruit thrown at your head. Answer (B) is correct."
