JPEG is a lossy compression method that is great for photographic images that contain lots of detail and color information. However, it tends to struggle with line art and can often produce artifacts, such as \"jaggies\" or blurring on sharp edges.\n\nTherefore, based on these factors, we can conclude that using JPEG to save an image of the Vitruvian Man is not a good idea. A more suitable format for this type of image would be a lossless format such as PNG or TIFF. These formats are better suited for line art and can preserve the sharp, precise edges of a drawing without introducing artifacts."
