According to their guidelines, the maximum amount of added sugars one should consume per day is:\n\n- Men: 150 calories per day (37.5 grams or 9 teaspoons).\n- Women: 100 calories per day (25 grams or 6 teaspoons).\n\nNow, we need to find out how much sugar is in a Krispy Kreme glazed doughnut. According to their website, a single glazed doughnut contains 10g of sugar. \n\nSince we have 4 doughnuts, we just need to multiply that by 4, which gives us a total of 40g of sugar.\n\nThis means that if a man were to eat 4 Krispy Kreme glazed doughnuts, he would exceed his daily sugar allowance by 2.5 teaspoons (40g \u00f7 4 = 10g per doughnut \u00f7 4 teaspoons per gram). Similarly, if a woman were to eat 4 doughnuts, she would exceed her daily sugar allowance by 4 teaspoons (40g \u00f7 4 = 10g per doughnut \u00f7 2.5 teaspoons per gram).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, 4 Krispy Kreme glazed doughnuts exceed AHA daily sugar allowance."
