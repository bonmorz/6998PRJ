While the exact number may vary, it is estimated to be around 45 million songs. \n\nNext, we need to calculate how many minutes it would take to listen to all of those songs. Assuming each song is an average of 4 minutes long, that would give us a total of 180 million minutes. \n\nNow, let's convert that to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 180 million minutes is equivalent to 3 million hours. \n\nFinally, we need to consider how many hours there are in a year. There are 24 hours in a day and 365 days in a year (366 in a leap year). So, there are approximately 8,760 hours in a year. \n\nWhen we compare 3 million hours to 8,760 hours, we can see that it is not possible to listen to the entire iTunes song catalog in one year. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

                "content": "Firstly, we need to determine the size of the Itunes song catalog. As of 2021, the catalog has approximately 75 million songs. \n\nNext, we need to calculate the total length of all the songs. Let's assume that each song is an average of 4 minutes long. We can convert this to seconds (4 minutes x 60 seconds) to get the length of a single song in seconds, which is 240 seconds.\n\nTo find the total length of all the songs in seconds, we can multiply 75 million songs by 240 seconds. This gives us 18 billion seconds of music.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of seconds in a year. There are 365 days in a year, and each day has 24 hours, which equals 86,400 seconds. Therefore, there are 31,536,000 seconds in a year (86,400 seconds x 365 days).\n\nIf we divide the total length of all the songs by the number of seconds in a year, we get 572 years (18 billion seconds \u00f7 31,536,000 seconds per year). This means that it would take 572 years to listen to the entire Itunes song catalog if you listened for 24 hours a day, every day of the year.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, it is not possible to listen to the entire Itunes song catalog in one year."

According to a report from 2018, there were over 45 million songs on iTunes. \n\nNext, we need to figure out how long it would take to listen to all of these songs. The length of a song can vary, but let's assume the average length is 3.5 minutes.\n\nTo calculate how long it would take to listen to all the songs in the catalog, we can use the following formula:\n\nTotal length of all songs = number of songs x length of each song / 60 (to convert minutes to hours)\n\nTotal length of all songs = 45,000,000 x 3.5 / 60 = 2,625,000 hours\n\nSo, it would take over 2.6 million hours to listen to every song in the iTunes catalog. \n\nIf we divide this by the number of hours in a year (8,760), we get:\n\n2,625,000 / 8,760 = 299.3 years\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to listen to every song in the iTunes catalog in one year. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no."
