Therefore, it is safe to conclude that polyamory is not allowed in the Catholic Church.\n6. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states, \u201cThe intimate community of life and love which constitutes the married state...implies a lifelong gift of a man and a woman to each other. [...] Polygamy is incompatible with the unity of marriage; divorce separates what God has joined together; the refusal of fertility turns married life away from its \"supreme gift,\" the child\u201d (CCC 1644, 1650).\n7. Some Catholics may argue that the Church\u2019s teaching on sex and marriage needs to be updated to reflect modern society\u2019s views, but as of now, the official stance of the Catholic Church is that polyamory is not allowed."

Any sexual activity outside of marriage is considered a sin, including adultery, fornication, and homosexuality. \n\nGiven these teachings, it is clear that polyamory is not allowed in the Catholic Church. It goes against the Church's belief in the importance of monogamy in sexual relationships and the sacredness of the marriage covenant.
