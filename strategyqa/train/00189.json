Frederick II, also known as Frederick the Great, became King of Prussia in 1740. \n\nSecondly, we need to determine when the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) was established. However, it is important to note that the SPD did not exist during Frederick II's reign or even during the time of Prussia as a monarchy. The SPD was founded in 1875, long after Frederick II's reign came to an end. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the Social Democratic Party of Germany could not have helped Frederick II become King of Prussia as they did not exist during his reign. Thus, the answer is (B) no."

Therefore, it would not have been possible for the SPD to have helped him become king. Secondly, Frederick II became king due to his father, Frederick William I, selecting him as his successor and training him for the position. The SPD, which is a modern political party, would not have had any involvement in this historical event. Therefore, the answer is no, the SPD did not help Frederick II become King of Prussia."

The party was founded in the late 1800s, many years after Frederick II's reign. Therefore, it is impossible for the party to have played any role in helping Frederick II become King of Prussia. \n\nFurthermore, Frederick II became King of Prussia due to a complex combination of factors, including his military successes, strategic alliances, and his own personal abilities as a ruler. The actions of a political party formed many years later could not have played a role in this historical event. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, the Social Democratic Party of Germany did not help Frederick II become King of Prussia."

Therefore, the party did not exist at the time Frederick II became king. Additionally, the Social Democratic Party of Germany is a left-wing political party with roots in socialism and Marxism, which is vastly different from the political climate in 18th century Europe. Therefore, it is highly improbable that they had any influence on Frederick II's rise to the throne. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
