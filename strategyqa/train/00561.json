Well, the concept of television did not exist during the time of Saint Peter, so there is no record of him ever watching television. Also, saints are believed to be in heaven, and it is uncertain if television is available or necessary there. Therefore, the answer to the question is no, Saint Peter could not watch television."

Since Saint Peter lived during the time of Jesus Christ, which was approximately 2000 years ago, it is impossible for him to watch television. Television was not invented until the 20th century, which is much later than when Saint Peter lived. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."
