He was a German philosopher and economist who is known for his influential work in the field of political theory, particularly Marxism. Marxism is a political and economic philosophy that advocates for a classless society in which private property is abolished and the means of production are owned and controlled by the community as a whole.\n\nSecond, we need to know about the Communist Party of China. The Communist Party of China (CPC) is the governing party of the People's Republic of China. It was founded in 1921 and has been in power since 1949.\n\nNow, to answer the question: Did Karl Marx influence the communist party of China? The answer is yes. The CPC was founded on Marxist principles, and Marx's ideas have played a significant role in shaping the party's ideology.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Chinese intellectuals and reformers began to look to Marxism as a way to address the country's social, economic, and political problems. In 1921, the CPC was founded by a group of Chinese revolutionaries who were inspired by the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and Marx's vision of a socialist society. The party's ideology is based on Marxist-Leninist-Maoist thought.\n\nIn summary, Karl Marx's ideas have had a lasting impact on the Communist Party of China, as the party was founded on Marxist principles and continues to adhere to Marxist-Leninist-Maoist thought. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."
