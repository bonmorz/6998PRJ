A vegemite sandwich is a popular Australian sandwich made with vegemite spread, which is a dark, salty paste made from yeast extract. \n\nNow, based on this information, we can safely say that Atlantic cod is NOT found in a vegemite sandwich. This is because a vegemite sandwich consists of bread and vegemite spread, and there is no mention of Atlantic cod being an ingredient in the sandwich. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
