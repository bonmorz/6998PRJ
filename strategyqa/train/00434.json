Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Maya Angelou's book would be relevant or required for this course.  As a renowned poet and civil rights activist, her work does not have a direct connection to chemistry. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"no\" or (B). It is important to note that while reading Maya Angelou's book may of personal interest or inspiration, it is not a required material for CHE101."

Based on this information, we can assume that the course is focused on chemistry and related topics. \n\nNow, let's consider the second part of the question which asks whether a Maya Angelou book would be required for someone in CHE 101. Maya Angelou was a famous author and poet who is known for her works on social justice, civil rights, and personal struggles. None of these topics are related to chemistry, which means that a Maya Angelou book would not be required for someone taking CHE 101. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no."
