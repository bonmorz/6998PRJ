Anchovies are small, oily fish that are commonly used as a topping on pizzas. \nNext, we need to consider whether or not fish have bones. Most fish do have bones, although some have bones that are small and less noticeable than others. Anchovies do have small, thin bones. \nTherefore, if anchovies are used as a topping on a pizza, then it is likely that there are bones in the pizza as well.

An anchovy pizza is a pizza that has anchovy fish as a topping. \n\nNext, we need to understand the anatomy of an anchovy fish. Anchovy fish do have bones, specifically a long spine that runs down the length of their body. \n\nTherefore, since an anchovy pizza uses anchovy fish as a topping, it is possible that there are bones in the pizza. These bones may be small and difficult to spot, but they could potentially be present. \n\nThus, the correct answer to this question is (A) yes, there may be bones in an anchovy pizza."

While fish do not have bones in their meat like land animals, they do have small, thin bones called \"microbones\" or \"fish bones\" in their body. Therefore, if anchovies are used as a topping on a pizza, there may be tiny bones mixed in with the fish meat.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about \"bones in an anchovy pizza\", not just the anchovies themselves. This means we also need to consider the pizza dough and any other toppings that may have bones (such as chicken or sausage). \n\nPizza dough, of course, is not made with bones, so that eliminates one possibility. As for other toppings, it is possible that some varieties of chicken or sausage may contain bones, but these are not typically used on an \"anchovy pizza\". \n\nTherefore, while it's not a guarantee, it's safe to assume that there are no bones in an anchovy pizza. However, if you are concerned about potential small fish bones in the anchovies themselves, you may want to choose a different pizza topping."

The anchovies are typically cleaned, gutted, and deboned before being used as a topping on a pizza. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, there are no bones in an anchovy pizza."
