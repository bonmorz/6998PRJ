Chlorine is used to disinfect water and sodium is used in food additives and as a flavor enhancer.\n\nWhen chlorine and sodium are mixed together, they react to form sodium chloride (commonly known as table salt). This reaction is known as a chemical reaction and it results in a completely different substance being formed.\n\nTherefore, it's not dangerous to consume chlorine when mixed with sodium because the chlorine has reacted with the sodium to form a different and harmless substance - salt. So, the correct answer is (B) no, it's not dangerous to consume chlorine when mixed with sodium."
