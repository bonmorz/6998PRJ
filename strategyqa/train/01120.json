The founders are Jerry Greenfield and Ben Cohen. \n\nNext, we need to consider the current status of their involvement. While both founders were involved in the early stages of the company's development, they have since had differing levels of involvement. \n\nBen Cohen officially retired from the company in 2000, and while he remains active in various social and political endeavors, he is not presently involved in the day-to-day operations of Ben & Jerry's. \n\nJerry Greenfield, on the other hand, has continued to be involved with the company, although his role has also evolved over time. He served as the company's CEO from 1984 to 1995, but has since stepped back from that role. He remains a member of the board of directors and is involved in various aspects of the company's strategic planning and decision-making.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that the correct answer to the question is (B) no, both founders are not currently involved in the company to the same degree."

They are Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield. \n\nNext, we need to know if they are still involved in the company. There are a few ways to approach this question, but one possible method is to look up recent news articles or company announcements.\n\nIf we search for \"Ben & Jerry's founders involvement\" on a search engine, we might find news articles such as \"Ben & Jerry\u2019s founders celebrate sale of company, vow to continue activism\" (source: The Boston Globe, 2020) or \"Ben & Jerry's statement on their founders' engagement in social justice issues\" (source: Ben & Jerry's website, 2019).\n\nFrom these sources, we can gather that while Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield sold the company to Unilever in 2000, they remain involved in various ways, such as serving on the Board of Directors, supporting social justice causes, and promoting the brand's values.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks if they are \"still involved in the company,\" which could be interpreted as meaning an active role in the day-to-day operations or decision-making of the company. Based on the available information, it is unclear if they have such an active role, so we can't definitively say that the answer is (A) yes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, as we cannot confirm that both founders are still involved in the company in an active capacity."
