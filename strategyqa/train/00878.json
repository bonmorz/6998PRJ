Andrew Johnson was the 17th president of the United States, so his presidential number is 17. On the other hand, Elagabalus was the 25th emperor of the Roman Empire, so his emperor number is 25.\n\nNext, we need to compare the two numbers to see if Andrew Johnson's presidential number is greater than Elagabalus's emperor number. Since 17 is less than 25, we can say that Andrew Johnson's presidential number does not exceed Elagabalus's emperor number. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."
