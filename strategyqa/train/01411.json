This event is recorded in the book of Daniel, which is part of the Old Testament. Therefore, our answer is (B) no, Daniel was not thrown into the lion's den in the New Testament."

Daniel was a prophet who lived during the Babylonian captivity, around 600 BC. He was known for his wisdom and his faith in God. One day, some officials tricked King Darius into making a decree that anyone who prayed to any god or man other than the king for 30 days should be thrown into a den of lions. Daniel continued to pray to God three times a day, as he always did, and was caught and brought before the king. \n\nThe king did not want to punish Daniel, but was bound by the law he had decreed. Daniel was thrown into the lion's den, but God protected him and he was unharmed. The next morning, the king was relieved to find Daniel alive and ordered that those who had tricked him into the decree be thrown into the den instead. \n\nNow, we can answer the question. It is clear that the story of Daniel and the lion's den is found in the Old Testament, specifically in the book of Daniel. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, Daniel was not thrown into the lion's den in the New Testament."

The New Testament is the second part of the Christian Bible and covers the life and teachings of Jesus Christ and the early Christian church. On the other hand, the Old Testament is the first part of the Christian Bible and covers the history of Israel and the Jewish religion before the birth of Jesus Christ.\n\nNow, let's focus on the story of Daniel and the lion's den. This story is from the Old Testament book of Daniel, which tells the story of a Jewish exile named Daniel who served in the court of the Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar. One day, some jealous officials tricked the king into signing a decree that anyone who prayed to any god or man other than the king would be thrown into a den of lions. Daniel, being faithful to his God, continued to pray to God three times a day despite the decree. As a result, he was thrown into the lion's den but God saved him by shutting the lions' mouths.\n\nSince the story of Daniel and the lion's den is from the Old Testament, the answer to the question is (B) no, Daniel was not thrown into the lion's den in the New Testament. His story is only found in the Old Testament book of Daniel."

The story of Daniel, on the other hand, is recorded in the Old Testament, which chronicles the history of the Jewish people before the birth of Jesus.\n\nNow, coming to the story of Daniel, it is recorded in the book of Daniel in the Old Testament. According to the story, Daniel was a Jewish prophet who served in the court of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar in the 6th century BCE. The king favored Daniel because of his ability to interpret dreams, but some of the king's courtiers were jealous of Daniel's position and plotted against him.\n\nOne of the plots involved convincing the king to issue a decree that anyone who prayed to any god or man other than the king for 30 days would be thrown into a den of lions. Despite the decree, Daniel continued to pray to his God three times a day as usual, and the conspirators caught him doing so. As a result, the king was forced to carry out the punishment, and Daniel was thrown into the den of lions.\n\nHowever, the story continues that God miraculously saved Daniel from the lions, and when the king checked on him in the morning, he found Daniel unharmed. The king then recognized the power of Daniel's God and issued a decree that the God of Daniel was to be respected throughout the kingdom.\n\nSo, to answer the question, no, Daniel was not thrown into the lion's den in the New Testament, as the story of Daniel predates the New Testament by several centuries."
