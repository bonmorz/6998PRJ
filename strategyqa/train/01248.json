A dichromat is a person who has a color vision deficiency and can only distinguish two out of the three primary colors.\n\nChlorine gas appears yellow-green while neon gas appears bright orange-red. These colors fall in the range of colors that a person with normal color vision can easily distinguish from one another. However, since dichromats can only distinguish two primary colors, it is likely that they would not be able to differentiate between the two gases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, a dichromat would probably not be able to easily distinguish chlorine gas from neon gas."

Since a dichromat can only see two primary colors, they will not be able to see the specific colors of the gases. Therefore, they will not be able to distinguish between the two gases based on their color.\n\nHowever, the dichromat can rely on other sensory cues, such as the smell, taste, or texture of the gases, to distinguish between them.
