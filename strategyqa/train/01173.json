Hydrogen is the first element on the periodic table and has an atomic number of 1. Therefore, Hydrogen's atomic number is 1.\n\nNext, we need to know how many Spice Girls there are. The Spice Girls were a famous British pop girl group consisting of five members - Victoria Beckham, Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm, and Geri Halliwell.\n\nSo, to determine if Hydrogen's atomic number squared exceeds the number of Spice Girls, we need to do some simple calculations. \n\nHydrogen's atomic number squared is 1\u00b2, which is 1. Therefore, we need to see if 1 is greater than the number of Spice Girls, which is 5.\n\nAs we can see, 1 is not greater than 5. Hence, the answer is (B) no - Hydrogen's atomic number squared does not exceed the number of Spice Girls."
