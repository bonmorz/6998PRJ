A state capital is the primary city or town associated with a state's government. Since Guam is not a state, it does not have a state capital.

Additionally, the concept of a state capital comes from the idea that states have their own individual governments with a capital city serving as the center for that state's government. In the case of Guam, while it does have its own government, it does not have a capital city. Instead, the island's seat of government is located in the village of Hagatna, which is sometimes referred to as the capital city of Guam, however, it is not officially designated as such. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is (B) no."
