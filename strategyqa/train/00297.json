These eyes are very different from the eyes of humans or other animals with single lenses. \n\nSecond, we need to think about the purpose of eye surgery. Usually, eye surgery is done to correct a particular defect or problem with the eye(s) that affects a patient's vision or quality of life. However, it is unlikely that a fly's eyesight is affected in the same way that a human's might be. Moreover, given the complex nature of a fly's compound eyes, it would be extremely difficult (if not impossible) to perform surgery on them and achieve any kind of meaningful result.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) Yes, performing eye surgery on a fly would likely be in vain."

Secondly, the purpose of eye surgery is to correct a vision problem or other issues related to eyes. It can also be used to prevent certain conditions from happening in the future. \n\nNow, since flies have small eyes, it would be difficult to perform surgery on their eyes due to their size. Even if the surgery was successful, it may not improve the fly's vision as much because of the size of its eyes in comparison to people. Therefore, it can be concluded that eye surgery on a fly would be in vain, making the answer (A) yes."

In fact, flies have compound eyes that allow them to perceive motion and fast-moving objects. \n\nNext, we need to consider if eye surgery is possible on a fly. This is more difficult to answer definitively, as there is no one-size-fits-all answer. However, in general, it is not common practice to perform eye surgery on insects or other small animals like flies. \n\nEven if eye surgery were possible on a fly, the question remains: would it be in vain? We can assume that the purpose of eye surgery would be to correct some sort of vision issue. However, flies have simple brains and rely heavily on their compound eyes for survival - namely, detecting predators and prey. It is unlikely that a fly would benefit from corrective eye surgery, as their eyes already function effectively in their natural environment. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes - eye surgery on a fly would likely be in vain."

This means that each lens would need to be operated on separately, making the procedure extremely difficult and time-consuming. Additionally, the parts used in human eye surgery may not be compatible with the anatomy of a fly's eye. Therefore, even if the surgery was somehow successful, it is unlikely that there would be any significant improvement to the fly's vision. Finally, the lifespan of a common housefly is only about 15-30 days, so even if the surgery did somehow extend its life, it would not be by a significant amount. Based on these considerations, the answer is yes, Eye surgery on a fly would be in vain."

Although there may be expert fly surgeons out there, eye surgery on a fly would be an incredibly challenging task given the fly's small size and anatomy. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that it would even be possible to perform eye surgery on a fly. \n\nEven if it were possible to perform eye surgery on a fly, we need to consider the purpose of such a procedure. Flies have compound eyes consisting of multiple lenses that provide them with a wide field of vision. It is unlikely that a fly would benefit from any sort of corrective surgery, as they have evolved to have highly adapted vision that allows them to perform sophisticated behaviors such as evading predators and finding food. \n\nTherefore, even if eye surgery on a fly were possible, it would likely be in vain as there would be no practical benefit to the fly's survival or functioning.
