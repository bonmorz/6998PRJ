Now, we also need to know that there are two types of twins: identical and fraternal. Identical twins are formed from a single fertilized egg that splits into two. They have the same genetic material, so they are always the same gender. On the other hand, fraternal twins are formed from two separate eggs that are fertilized by two different sperm. They have different genetic material and can be either the same or opposite gender. Therefore, since not all twins are identical and can be fraternal, the answer is (B) no, all twins are not the same gender."

There are two types of twins: identical twins and fraternal twins. Identical twins are formed when a single fertilized egg splits into two embryos. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, are formed when two separate eggs are fertilized by two different sperm.\n\nNow, coming back to the question, the answer is no. Not all twins are the same gender. Fraternal twins can be of the same or different gender, just like any other siblings. Identical twins, on the other hand, are always of the same gender because they develop from a single fertilized egg which contains either XX chromosomes (female) or XY chromosomes (male). Therefore, if the fertilized egg contains XX chromosomes, both twins will be female, and if it contains XY chromosomes, both twins will be male. \n\nIn conclusion, the gender of twins depends on whether they are fraternal or identical. Fraternal twins can be of the same or different gender, whereas identical twins are always of the same gender."

There are two types of twins: identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic). \n\nIdentical twins occur when a single fertilized egg (zygote) divides into two embryos. These twins share the same genetic material and are always the same gender. In contrast, fraternal twins occur when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm cells. These twins share about 50% of genetic material, just like any other siblings, and can be of the same or opposite sex.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. Not all twins are the same gender. Only fraternal twins can be of the opposite gender."

These embryos can either share one placenta (monochorionic) or have two separate placentas (dichorionic). \n\nNow, let's consider gender. Gender is determined by the sex chromosome carried by the sperm that fertilizes the egg. Specifically, a sperm carrying a Y chromosome will result in a male, while a sperm carrying an X chromosome will result in a female. \n\nSince each embryo in a set of twins is fertilized by a separate sperm, there is no guarantee that they will be the same gender. In fact, fraternal (dizygotic) twins, who come from two separate eggs, are more likely to be different genders than identical (monozygotic) twins, who come from a single fertilized egg that splits into two embryos. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, not all twins are the same gender."
