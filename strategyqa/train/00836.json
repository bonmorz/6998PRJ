It is a fellowship of the world's most eminent scientists and a learned society that promotes science and its use for the benefit of humanity. \nSecondly, what is numerology? Numerology is the belief in the mystical relationship between numbers and events. \nNow, can we see any connection between the two? No, there is no connection between numerology and science. Numerology does not follow scientific principles and often relies on superstition and belief rather than evidence-based research. As a result, numerologists cannot become members of the Royal Society, which is based on scientific merit and achievement. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

Numerology is not considered a scientific discipline.

No. As a prestigious scientific society, the Royal Society only accepts members who have made significant contributions to the scientific community through their research and discoveries. Numerology, as a pseudoscientific practice, does not comply with the rigorous scientific standards maintained by the Royal Society, and as a result, numerologists cannot become members of the Royal Society. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no."

The Royal Society is a prestigious scientific organization based in London, England. It's one of the oldest and most respected scientific societies in the world.\n\n3. Now, let's combine these two pieces of information. Numerology is not a recognized scientific field; it's considered a pseudoscience. The Royal Society is a scientific organization that only accepts members who are recognized experts in established scientific fields.\n\n4. Based on this, we can conclude that numerologists cannot become members of the Royal Society. The answer is (B) no.\n\n5. In short, the Royal Society only allows members who are experts in established scientific fields, and numerology is not considered a recognized scientific field. Therefore, numerologists cannot become members of the Royal Society."
