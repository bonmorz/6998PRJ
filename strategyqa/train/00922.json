According to a 2018 article by The Japan Times, it was last painted in 2017.\n- How often is Tokyo Tower typically repainted? It is typically repainted every 5 years.\n- If Tokyo Tower was last painted in 2017 and repainting occurs every 5 years, when is the next scheduled repainting? The next scheduled repainting would be in 2022.\n- If President Trump's first term ends in 2021 and the next scheduled repainting isn't until 2022, will Tokyo Tower be repainted once during his first term? No, it will not. \nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

According to its official website, Tokyo Tower is repainted every five years. \n\nNext, we need to determine how long President Trump's first term will be. A US presidential term lasts four years, so we need to find out when Trump's first term began and when it will end. \n\nDonald Trump's first term as President of the United States began on January 20, 2017, and ended on January 20, 2021. Therefore, his first term lasted exactly four years. \n\nNow that we know Tokyo Tower is usually repainted every five years, we need to see if there is any overlap between Trump's first term and a repaint cycle. \n\nSince Trump's first term lasted four years and Tokyo Tower is repainted every five years, the tower would have been repainted once during his term if it was due for a repaint between January 20, 2017, and January 20, 2021. \n\nThe previous repaint cycle ended in 2017, so by the end of Trump's first term, it would have been five years since the last repaint. Therefore, Tokyo Tower would have been due for a repaint during Trump's first term, and the answer is (A) yes, it will be repainted once during his first term."
