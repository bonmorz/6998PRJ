Based on the wording of the question, it seems likely that we are referring to the record for oldest boxer to compete in a professional boxing match.\n\nThe current record is held by Bernard Hopkins, who fought at the age of 52 years and 77 days. Evander Holyfield was born on October 19, 1962, which means that as of the time of this writing (November 2021), he is 59 years old. \n\nIf Holyfield were to return to professional boxing in 2020 (which has already passed), he would have been 58 years old at the time. This would not be old enough to break the age record set by Hopkins, and therefore the answer to this question is (B), no.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that Holyfield did in fact make a boxing comeback in 2021 at the age of 58, with his first fight taking place on June 5th. He is not able to break the age record for oldest boxer to compete, but he is still making history as a boxer in his late 50s."

Therefore, if he were to return to boxing in 2020, he would be returning after a long hiatus of almost ten years. \n\nSecondly, the record for the oldest professional boxer to win a world title is currently held by Bernard Hopkins, who won the IBF light heavyweight title at the age of 49 years and 9 months. \n\nGiven that Holyfield was born in 1962, he is currently 58 years old. Even if he were to return to the ring in 2020 and win a world title in his weight division, he would still be two years older than Hopkins' record. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, an Evander Holyfield 2020 boxing return would not set an age record."

It is not uncommon for boxers to have a long career, but typically retire before their 50s or 60s due to the physical toll the sport takes on their body. \n\nAfter researching, we find that several boxers have returned to the ring at an age older than 58. For example, Bernard Hopkins made a comeback at age 49 in 2016. However, we are looking for whether or not Evander Holyfield would set an age record. \n\nBased on the research, we see that an age record has already been set by George Foreman. Foreman returned to the ring at the age of 45 and became the oldest heavyweight world champion in history at the age of 45. Therefore, Holyfield would not set an age record for a boxing return in 2020. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

To answer this, we need to know Evander Holyfield's current age. As of May 2020, Holyfield is 57 years old. \n\nIf he were to return to boxing in 2020, he would be attempting to win the heavyweight boxing title at an age of 57.
