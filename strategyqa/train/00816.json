Mount Everest is the highest peak in the world, standing at 8,848 meters. \n\nOn the other hand, Mount Emei is located in China and stands at 3,099 meters high. This means that it is much lower in altitude compared to Mount Everest. In addition, Mount Emei has well-developed trails and infrastructure for climbers. \n\nConsidering these facts, it would not be difficult for Kami Rita to climb Mount Emei. The altitude is much lower and the mountain is not considered to be as challenging as Mount Everest. Thus, the answer is (B) no, it would not be difficult for Kami Rita to climb Mount Emei."

Kami Rita Sherpa is a Nepalese Sherpa mountaineer who holds the record for most ascents of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world, with 24 successful summits.He is known for his skills in climbing and has vast experience in mountaineering.\n\nNext, we have to consider Mount Emei. Mount Emei, also known as Emeishan, is a mountain located in Sichuan province, China. It is one of the Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains of China and is known for its beauty and historic significance.\n\nNow, we have to analyze whether it would be difficult for Kami Rita to climb Mount Emei. Considering his vast experience in climbing and his feat of ascending Mount Everest 24 times, it is unlikely that climbing Mount Emei would be challenging for him. Mount Emei is not as tall as Mount Everest, and the climb is considered moderate in difficulty.\n\nTherefore, based on the information we have, the answer to the question is (B) no, it would not be difficult for Kami Rita to climb Mount Emei."
