The term \"baker's dozen\" implies 13, so we are being asked if the Gracie founders had at least 13 children between them. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to know a bit about the Gracie family. The Gracies are a prominent Brazilian family that helped develop and popularize Brazilian jiu-jitsu, a martial art focused on ground grappling and submission techniques. The Gracie family has many members, with some of the most well-known being Carlos Gracie and his brothers, who were instrumental in spreading jiu-jitsu around the world.\n\nIn terms of the number of children the Gracie founders had, we can look to historical records and biographies. Carlos Gracie, for example, had 21 children, including several with the same name (such as Carlos Gracie Jr. and Carlos Gracie III). His brother Helio Gracie had 10 children, including several who also became accomplished jiu-jitsu practitioners. \n\nBased on this information, we can confidently say that the Gracie founders did indeed have at least a baker's dozen of kids between them. Carlos and Helio had a combined total of 31 children, which is well over 13. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is (A) yes."

To answer the question, we need to know how many Gracie founders there are and how many kids they have collectively. \n\nThe Gracie family has many members, so to narrow down the field to the founders, we can look at the first few generations of the family. Carlos Gracie and Helio Gracie are considered the main founders of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and both had large families. \n\nCarlos had 21 children, while Helio had 10. So together, they had 31 children.
