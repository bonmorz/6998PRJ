No, because one of the requirements is being in good standing with the Church, and agnosticism goes against the fundamental beliefs of the Church, which holds that there is a God who can be known and worshiped. Additionally, since agnostics do not believe in the Church's teachings, it is unlikely that they would be ordained as a bishop or in any other position of high leadership within the Church. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, a believer in agnosticism cannot become pope."

It does not necessarily align with any particular religion or religious doctrine. Now, to become the pope, one must be a member of the Catholic Church, which has clearly defined beliefs in God, Jesus Christ, and other religious doctrines. \n\nA person who identifies as agnostic may not necessarily subscribe to these beliefs, and therefore may not be able to become a pope. Additionally, the pope is elected by the College of Cardinals, who are all members of the Catholic Church and bound by its teachings.
