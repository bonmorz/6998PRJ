Typically, this refers to the apostles who traveled and spread the Christian message after the death of Jesus.\n\nNext, we need to understand what is meant by \"mass.\" Mass is the religious ceremony celebrated in the Catholic Church and some other Christian denominations, which includes reading scripture, prayer, and communion.\n\nSo, were the apostles required to attend mass on Sundays? While the specific term \"mass\" may not have been used at the time, it is probable that the apostles attended some form of religious gathering on Sundays. The book of Acts in the Bible mentions that the early Christians gathered together on the first day of the week (which was Sunday) to break bread and listen to teachings from the apostles (Acts 20:7). This type of gathering was likely a form of worship and would have included some elements of what we now recognize as a mass.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, the first missionaries were likely required to attend some form of religious gathering on Sundays, which would have included elements of what we now recognize as a mass."

This means we are looking for information about the very first individuals who went out to spread the Christian message. \n\nNext, we need to consider the term \"mass.\" Mass is a term used in the Catholic Church to refer to the celebration of the Eucharist, which is considered the centerpiece of the church's worship. \n\nGiven these two factors - the first missionaries and the Catholic Church - we can reasonably assume that the question is asking if the first Christian missionaries were required to attend Catholic mass on Sundays. \n\nNow, we need to think about the historical context. Christianity began as a Jewish sect and it wasn't until later that it developed into a distinct religion. The Catholic Church, as we know it today, didn't exist until several centuries after the birth of Christianity. \n\nHowever, we do know that early Christian worship involved regular gatherings of believers to share meals, pray, and read from scripture. Over time, these gatherings evolved into formalized worship services that included elements of what we now call \"mass.\" \n\nGiven this information, it seems likely that the first Christian missionaries would have been required to attend some form of worship service on Sundays, even if it wasn't technically \"mass\" as we know it today. And if they were operating under the auspices of the Catholic Church (which is the only logical assumption given the timeframe of the question), it's even more likely that they would have been expected to attend Catholic mass. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, the first missionaries were likely required to attend mass on Sundays."

This indicates that we are talking about a specific group of people who were sent out to spread a particular religious message. \n\nNext, the question asks whether these first missionaries were required to attend mass on Sundays. To answer this, we need to consider the context of the time and place where the missionaries were working. \n\nIt is important to note that the question does not specify which religion or denomination the missionaries belonged to, so we cannot assume any particular set of beliefs or practices. However, we can make some general assumptions based on the historical context. \n\nFor example, if we were talking about Christian missionaries sent out during the early years of the Roman Catholic Church, then it is likely that yes, they were required to attend mass on Sundays. This would have been a central part of their religious duties and obligations, and failing to attend mass regularly would have been seen as a serious breach of faith. \n\nOn the other hand, if we were talking about missionaries from a more Protestant tradition, the answer might be different. Some Protestant denominations do not place as much emphasis on regular attendance at church services, and may not require their missionaries to attend mass or any other specific worship service. \n\nOverall, without more information about the specific group of missionaries being referred to, it is difficult to give a definitive answer to this question. However, based on the historical context and general assumptions about religious practices, the answer is likely to be (A) yes, the first missionaries were required to attend mass on Sundays."

With this in mind, we know that Christianity started as a Jewish sect, so it is likely that the earliest missionaries were Jewish Christians. \n\nNext, we are asked if these missionaries were required to attend mass on Sundays. The idea of Sunday mass would not have existed in the earliest days of Christianity, as the idea of a dedicated day of rest and worship was still developing. Additionally, the early Christian gatherings would have taken place in homes, rather than in dedicated churches. \n\nHowever, it is still possible that these Jewish Christian missionaries attended some kind of religious gathering on a regular basis. In the Jewish tradition, Saturday (the Sabbath) was the day of rest and worship. It is possible that these early Christian missionaries continued to observe the Sabbath as part of their religious practice. On the other hand, it is possible that they shifted their main day of worship to Sunday, as this was the day of Jesus' resurrection. \n\nOverall, while we cannot say for certain whether the first missionaries were required to attend mass on Sundays, it is unlikely that this would have been a requirement given the early development of Christian worship practices."

The question asks whether the first missionaries were required to attend mass on Sundays. Since the early Christians were deeply committed to their faith and highly observant of religious rituals and practices, it would be reasonable to assume that they would have attended mass regularly. Additionally, since attending mass has been a core component of Christian worship for centuries, it is highly unlikely that the practice was not observed in the early days of Christianity.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, we can confidently answer that the first missionaries were indeed required to attend mass on Sundays."
