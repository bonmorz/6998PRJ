According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the world's ginger production in 2018 was 3.3 million metric tons (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC). \nNext, we need to know the capacity of the Port of Baltimore. According to the Port of Baltimore website (https://www.mpa.maryland.gov/port-overview), the port handled 43 million tons of cargo in 2019. \nTo find out if the port can handle the world's ginger production, we need to convert metric tons to tons. 1 metric ton is equal to 1.10231 tons. So, the world's ginger production in tons is 3.3 million x 1.10231 = 3,639,023 tons. \nNow, we compare the world's ginger production to the Port of Baltimore's cargo capacity. We can see that the port's cargo capacity is 43 million tons, which is much larger than the world's ginger production of 3,639,023 tons. Therefore, the port could handle the entire world's cargo production of ginger each year. Thus, the answer is (A) yes."

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the world's ginger production was approximately 4.68 million metric tons in 2019. \n\nNext, we need to know the capacity of the Port of Baltimore to handle cargo. According to their website, the Port of Baltimore is one of the largest ports in the United States and handles approximately 30 million tons of cargo per year. \n\nTo determine if the Port of Baltimore could handle the world's ginger production, we need to convert the 4.68 million metric tons to tons. One metric ton equals approximately 1.10231 tons, so 4.68 million metric tons equal approximately 5.15 million tons. \n\nNow, we compare the world's ginger production (5.15 million tons) to the Port of Baltimore's cargo capacity (30 million tons). Since the Port of Baltimore can handle significantly more cargo than the entire world's ginger production, the answer is yes, the Port of Baltimore could handle the entire world's cargo production of ginger each year."

According to the Port of Baltimore's website, it has a total of 50 berths (ship docking areas) and handles over 30 million tonnes of cargo each year. \n\nTo determine if the Port of Baltimore can handle the entire world's production of ginger, we need to compare the amount of ginger produced to the port's cargo handling capacity. \n\nDividing the global production of ginger by the port's annual cargo capacity, we get: \n\n4.9 million tonnes / 30 million tonnes = 0.163 or approximately 16.3% \n\nThis means that the Port of Baltimore has the capacity to handle only 16.3% of the global ginger production each year. However, this is still a significant amount and the answer to the question is yes, the Port of Baltimore could handle a large portion of the world's ginger production."

According to the Maryland Port Administration's website, the Port of Baltimore has a total annual cargo tonnage capacity of 43 million tons. \n\nTo calculate if the Port of Baltimore could handle the entire world's production of ginger, we can divide the annual production of ginger by the port's cargo capacity:\n\n4.4 million tons / 43 million tons = 0.102\n\nThis means that the Port of Baltimore can handle 10.2% of the world's annual ginger production. Therefore, the answer is yes, the Port of Baltimore could handle the entire world's cargo production of ginger each year, but only a fraction of it."

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the global production of ginger was about 3.3 million tonnes in 2019. \n\nNext, we need to know the cargo capacity of the Port of Baltimore. According to the official website of the Maryland Port Administration, the Port of Baltimore has a total of 50-foot-deep container berths capable of handling the biggest ships in the world, and it has an annual cargo handling capacity of 43 million tons.\n\nTo determine if the Port of Baltimore can handle the entire world's cargo production of ginger, we need to convert 3.3 million tonnes into tons. There are 1.10231 tons in a metric tonne, so 3.3 million tonnes x 1.10231 = 3,639,183.3 tons of ginger are produced globally each year.\n\nComparing the annual cargo-handling capacity of the Port of Baltimore (43 million tons) to the annual ginger production (3,639,183.3 tons), we can see that the port can handle the entire world's cargo of ginger production with plenty of capacity to spare. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes."

One metric tonne is equal to 1.10231 short tons, so the world's ginger production is approximately 3,733,512 tons. \n\nIf we divide the world's ginger production by the port's annual cargo throughput, we get:\n\n3,733,512 tons/43,661,244 tons = 0.0855\n\nThis means that the Port of Baltimore would only need to handle 8.55% of its annual cargo throughput to manage the entire world's production of ginger.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the global production of ginger in 2019 was about 4.4 million metric tons.\n\nNext, we need to know the capacity of the Port of Baltimore, which is one of the busiest seaports in the United States. According to the Maryland Port Administration, the Port of Baltimore has a 50-foot deep channel, which allows it to handle some of the largest cargo vessels in the world. The port also has 50 berths and over 40 cranes.\n\nTo determine whether the Port of Baltimore can handle the entire world's cargo production of ginger each year, we need to compare the port's capacity with the amount of ginger produced in the world. \n\nAssuming that the ginger is shipped in standard shipping containers, we can use the average weight of a 20-foot container (about 2.2 metric tons) and a 40-foot container (about 4.5 metric tons) to calculate the number of containers needed to transport 4.4 million metric tons of ginger.\n\nAccording to the Ocean Shipping Container Capacity & Dimensions for Total Capacity of 20-foot container, the maximum capacity is 33.2 cubic meters, while the 40-foot container holds about 67 cubic meters. Dividing the total amount of ginger produced by the capacity of a 20-foot container means that we would need approximately 2 million containers to carry all the ginger. If using 40-foot containers, we would need around 977 thousand containers.\n\nWe don't know the exact capacity of the Port of Baltimore, but given the port's infrastructure, it is reasonable to assume that it can handle at least a significant portion of the world's cargo production of ginger. Therefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes."
