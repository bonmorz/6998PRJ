We can do this by using an online moon phase calculator or an app that shows lunar data. \n\nAssuming we get a moonset time of 10:00 PM EST, we can then check the schedule for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to see if it airs after that time. According to NBC's website, the show normally airs at 11:35 PM EST. \n\nTherefore, since 11:35 PM is after the hypothetical moonset time of 10:00 PM, we can say that The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon does air after moonset on August 20th, 2020 in EST. Thus, the answer is (A) yes."
