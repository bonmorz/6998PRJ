So, the question is asking whether Edward Snowden could be a member of MENSA. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to know Edward Snowden's IQ score. However, we don't have access to that information. So, we have to make an assumption based on what we do know about him. \n\nEdward Snowden is a former contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA) who leaked classified information in 2013. He is known for his intelligence and technical skills, which suggests that he is a highly intelligent individual. \n\nBased on this information, it is reasonable to assume that Edward Snowden could score in the top 2% on an IQ test, which would make him eligible for MENSA membership. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

However, it has been reported that he scored 145 on a practice test for the Mensa IQ exam. This score would put him in the top 0.1% of the population, which is higher than the required top 2% to join MENSA. \n\nTherefore, based on this information, we can conclude that Edward Snowden has the potential to join MENSA, and the answer to the question is (A) yes."

Does Snowden's action of leaking classified information disqualify him from joining MENSA? - No, Snowden's actions have no bearing on his intelligence quotient (IQ) or his ability to perform well on an approved intelligence test.\n4. Can Snowden score at the 98th percentile or higher on an approved intelligence test? - It's possible as Snowden is known for his intelligence and analytical abilities.\n5.

To become a member of MENSA, one must score in the top 2% on an approved intelligence test. \n\nNext, we need to consider if Edward Snowden's IQ falls within the top 2%. According to reports, Edward Snowden has a long history of excelling academically and achieving high test scores. Additionally, he reportedly scored very well on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), a test used by the US military to evaluate recruits. While we do not have an official record of his IQ score, it is reasonable to assume that a person with his academic and intellectual achievements would likely fall within the top 2%. \n\nTherefore, based on the information available, it is likely that Edward Snowden could join MENSA as a member. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

MENSA is an exclusive society that only admits individuals whose intelligence quotient (IQ) is within the top 2% of the population. In other words, only individuals with an IQ of 130 or higher can join MENSA.\n\nNow let's focus on Edward Snowden. Edward Snowden is a former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor who leaked classified information about the NSA's surveillance activities to the media in 2013. Edward Snowden has not publicly disclosed his IQ score, so we cannot know for sure whether he has an IQ of 130 or higher.\n\nHowever, we do know that Edward Snowden is a very intelligent and knowledgeable person. He studied computer science without a college degree and worked for the NSA and other intelligence agencies. He also had access to top-secret information, which indicates that he possessed the necessary intelligence and knowledge to handle such sensitive information.\n\nTherefore, it is reasonable to assume that Edward Snowden has an IQ of 130 or higher, which means he could potentially join MENSA if he wanted to. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."
