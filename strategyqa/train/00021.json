Therefore, it was impossible for Richard III to have met his grandson. Additionally, Richard III had only one legitimate child, who was Edward IV. Edward IV had ten children, including Edward VI, but Richard III was not their father, so he did not have any biological grandchildren. Therefore, Richard III did not know his grandson, and the answer is (B)."

This means that he lived in the 15th century.\n\nNow, let's consider his family. Richard III had only one legitimate child, a son named Edward of Middleham. Edward was born in 1473 and died in April 1484, when he was just 10 or 11 years old.\n\nTherefore, Richard III did have a grandson - but only for a very short period of time. Edward of Middleham did not have any children, so Richard III could not have known any other grandchildren.\n\nIn short, the answer to the question is no, Richard III did not know his grandson."

He did have a son named Edward, who eventually became Edward V. However, Edward V was never crowned king because his uncle, Richard III, seized the throne from him. \n\nNow let's focus on the question - did Richard III know his grandson? Since Edward V was never crowned king and was only a child when Richard III took the throne, it is unlikely that Richard III had much opportunity to develop a relationship with him. Additionally, because Richard III died two years after taking the throne, it is unlikely that he would have developed a relationship with any grandchildren that Edward V may have had. \n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (B) no. Richard III probably did not know his grandson."
