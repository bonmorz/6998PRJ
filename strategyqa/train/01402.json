This is because they are made of carbon atoms that are tightly compacted together. \n\nNext, we know that for an object to float on water, it needs to be less dense than water. This is because the water pushes against the object with an upward force called buoyancy. \n\nSince we know diamonds are very dense and heavy, they will not displace enough water to have the upward force needed to float. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, a diamond cannot float on water."

The density of a diamond ranges from 3.15 to 3.53 grams per cubic centimeter, depending on the quality and structure of the diamond. \n\nSecondly, we need to know the density of water. The density of water is 1 gram per cubic centimeter.\n\nNow, if we compare the density of a diamond (3.15-3.53 g/cm\u00b3) with the density of water (1 g/cm\u00b3), we can see that the density of a diamond is much higher than the density of water. \n\nAccording to Archimedes' Principle, when an object is placed in water, the object will float if it is less dense than water and will sink if it is more dense than water. Since the density of a diamond is much greater than the density of water, a diamond will sink in water and will not float. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no."

On the other hand, if the gravitational force is greater than the buoyant force, the object will sink. A diamond is a very hard material and has a high density of approximately 3.5 g/cm\u00b3 which means that it is heavier than the water. As a result, the gravitational force of the diamond is greater than the buoyant force, so it will sink in water. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, a diamond cannot float on water."

The formula for density is given as: density= mass/volume.\n\nNow, let's consider the density of water and diamond. The density of diamond is about 3.5 g/cm3, whereas the density of water is 1 g/cm3. This means that the density of diamond is greater than water, which implies that diamond is more massive than water per unit volume.\n\nIf an object is more massive per unit volume than the liquid it is placed in, then it sinks in that liquid. Hence, as diamond is more massive per unit volume than water, it will sink in water and not float on it. Therefore, the answer to the given question is (B) no, a diamond cannot float on water."

The density of water is 1 gram per cubic centimeter. Therefore, the diamond's density is much higher than water, meaning that it will not float on water. \n\nFurthermore, diamonds are not porous, which means that they cannot displace enough water to float. They are also much denser than most other materials, making them one of the heaviest substances readily available to us. So, in conclusion, a diamond cannot float on water."
