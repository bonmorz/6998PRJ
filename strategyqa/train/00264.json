Javier Sotomayor is a retired Cuban track and field athlete who holds the world record for the highest jump cleared over a bar. His highest jump was 8 feet 0.46 inches (2.45 meters), which is an impressive feat for a human. \n\nTherefore, Javier Sotomayor's highest jump is not even close to the height of an average giraffe.

According to research, the average height of a giraffe is 18 feet, and their heads make up about one-third of their overall height, which equals 6 feet on average. \n\nNext, we need to know the height of Javier Sotomayor's vertical jump. Sotomayor is the current world record holder for the high jump, which stands at 8 feet and 0.46 inches. \n\nNow we can compare Sotomayor's jump to the height of a giraffe's head. If we subtract the height of a giraffe's head (6 feet) from Sotomayor's jump (8 feet and 0.46 inches), we get 2 feet and 0.46 inches. \n\nTherefore, Javier Sotomayor's jump is not enough to clear the height of a giraffe's head, which is 6 feet on average. So, the answer is (B) no, he can't jump over the head of an average giraffe."
