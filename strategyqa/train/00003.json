The Boxer Rebellion, also known as the Boxer Uprising, was a violent anti-foreign and anti-Christian uprising that took place in China between 1899 and 1901. It was primarily a conflict between China and a group of foreign powers, including the United States, Great Britain, Japan, Germany, France, and Russia.\n\nNext, we need to understand what the Royal Air Force is. The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the aerial warfare service branch of the British Armed Forces, and it was established on April 1, 1918.\n\nNow, let's put these two pieces of information together. The Boxer Rebellion took place between 1899 and 1901, and the Royal Air Force was established in 1918, seventeen years after the Boxer Rebellion. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that the Royal Air Force did not fight in the Boxer Rebellion. The answer is (B), no."
