Hawaii's cuisine is a fusion of various cultural influences, including Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Polynesian, and Portuguese cuisine. Second, we need to determine if pig meat is commonly used in any of these cultural influences. Pork is widely used in Hawaiian cuisine, and it is a significant part of several popular dishes. For example, laulau, a traditional Hawaiian delicacy, is made with pork, taro leaves, and salted butterfish. Pork is also used in Hawaiian-style barbecue, kalua pig, and Spam musubi. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, pig meat is not considered inedible within the cuisine of Hawaii."

Hawaiians traditionally raised pigs for their meat, and they were an essential part of their diet. They even had special cooking methods for pig meat, such as kalua pig, which involved wrapping the pig in banana leaves and cooking it in an underground oven.\n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that pig meat would be considered inedible within the cuisine of Hawaii. In fact, pig meat remains a staple in traditional Hawaiian dishes such as lau lau, which is made with pork and taro leaves. \n\nSo, the correct answer is (B) no, pig meat is not considered inedible within the cuisine of Hawaii."

Hawaii is an island state located in the Pacific Ocean, known for its tropical climate, beautiful beaches and unique culture. Secondly, we need to consider the traditional cuisine of Hawaii. The Hawaiian cuisine is heavily influenced by the Polynesian culture and is characterized by the use of fresh seafood, fruits, and vegetables. They also have a rich tradition of barbeque (or \"luaus\") which includes meat dishes such as Kalua pig, a dish made by slow-roasting a whole pig in an underground oven. \n\nTherefore, pig meat (especially pork) is not considered inedible in Hawaiian cuisine. In fact, it is a staple in many dishes in Hawaii. Pork dishes like laulau (pork wrapped in taro leaves) and char siu (Chinese-style barbeque pork) are popular Hawaiian dishes. Hence, the correct answer is (B) no, pig meat is not considered inedible within the cuisine of Hawaii."
