It is a large area in the Indian Ocean where there is a concentration of marine debris, mostly plastics. The patch was discovered in 2010 by a group of scientists.\n\nNext, we need to understand what is meant by \"two full rotations of debris.\" This refers to the amount of time it takes for the debris in the patch to move in a circular pattern due to ocean currents. One rotation would indicate the time it takes for the debris to complete one full circle, while two rotations would indicate the time it takes for the debris to complete two full circles and return to its original location.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that if the Indian Ocean garbage patch has not completed two full rotations of debris since its discovery, it means less than 10 years have passed since the patch was first discovered. This is because it takes more than five years for the debris in the patch to complete one full rotation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, as the patch was discovered in 2010 and less than 10 years have passed since then, meaning it has not completed two full rotations of debris."

This refers to the amount of time it takes for the debris to circulate in the ocean, usually due to ocean currents. \nNow, to answer the question - since the garbage patch was discovered, has it completed two full rotations of debris? The answer is no. This means that the debris has not yet completed a full cycle of traveling around the ocean and returning to its starting point. As for how much time has passed since it was discovered until now, that is not provided in the question and therefore cannot be answered."

What is the Indian Ocean garbage patch? \n\nThe Indian Ocean garbage patch is a large area of marine debris located in the Indian Ocean, similar to other garbage patches that exist in other oceans around the world. \n\n2. When was it discovered? \n\nThe Indian Ocean garbage patch was first discovered in 2010 by a team of scientists from the European Space Agency. \n\n3. What does it mean for the debris to complete two full rotations? \n\nAs the debris in the garbage patch is constantly moved around by ocean currents, it is possible for it to complete two full rotations around the center of the patch. This means that the debris would have traveled around the patch in a circular pattern, covering a certain distance. \n\n4. Has the Indian Ocean garbage patch not completed two full rotations of debris since its discovery? \n\nThe answer to this question is yes. The patch was discovered in 2010, and as of 2021, only 11 years have passed. Ocean currents can be slow-moving, and it is unlikely that the debris in the patch has completed two full rotations in such a short period of time. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

The question does not provide a specific date, but we can assume it was discovered at some point in the past. \n\nThen, what does it mean for the garbage patch to complete two full rotations of debris? This likely refers to the circulation of ocean currents that can move the debris in a circular pattern. \n\nSo, to answer the question, we need to determine if the garbage patch has completed two full rotations since its discovery. Since the question states \"not completed two full rotations,\" we can deduce that it has completed at least one rotation, but not a second. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes, the Indian Ocean garbage patch has not completed two full rotations of debris since its discovery."

One rotation of debris would mean that all the debris in the patch would have traveled a full circle around the ocean. However, because of ocean currents, it is impossible to determine exactly how long it would take for one rotation. \n\nThe average time for one rotation in the North Pacific garbage patch is about 6 years, but again, this depends on the specific currents in each ocean region. \n\nSince the Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010, only 10 years have passed, which is not enough time for the debris to have completed two full rotations. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, the Indian Ocean garbage patch has not completed two full rotations of debris since its discovery."

The Indian Ocean garbage patch was first discovered in 2010, and since then, ocean currents have continued to move the plastic debris around in a circular pattern. According to research published in 2020, the garbage patch has completed at least two full rotations since its discovery, with one rotation taking approximately six years.
