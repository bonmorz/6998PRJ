On the other hand, a vegan festival is an event that promotes and celebrates plant-based food choices and excludes any animal products. Therefore, a human following a hyena diet, which involves consuming animal products, would not be considered as a suitable attendee at a vegan festival. It's because they would not align with the dietary requirements that the event promotes.

A hyena diet typically includes meat, bones, and other animal products, while a vegan diet excludes all animal products. A vegan festival is an event where individuals, vendors, and organizations come together to celebrate and promote the vegan lifestyle.\n\nGiven this, we can say that someone following a hyena diet would most likely be consuming animal products, which goes against the principles of a vegan festival. Therefore, it's safe to assume that they would be unwelcome at such an event. Thus, the correct answer is (A) yes."

They typically hunt and scavenge for their food, and their diet includes animals such as antelopes, zebras, and other small mammals.\n\nNow, let's think about the vegan festival. As the name suggests, a vegan festival is a gathering of people who follow a vegan diet. Veganism is a lifestyle that excludes the consumption of all animal products, including meat, dairy, eggs, and honey.\n\nGiven this information, we can deduce that a human following a hyena diet would be consuming animal products, which is contrary to the principles of veganism. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that they would be unwelcome at a vegan festival.\n\nHence, the correct answer is (A) yes."
