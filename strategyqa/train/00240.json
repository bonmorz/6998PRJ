Ferguson was a Supreme Court decision in 1896 that legalized segregation in public facilities, such as schools and transportation, as long as the separate facilities were equal in quality. This decision has been widely criticized as promoting institutionalized racism.\n\nNow, we need to consider Woodrow Wilson's views on segregation. Woodrow Wilson was the President of the United States from 1913 to 1921. He was known for his progressive policies, such as the New Freedom program, which aimed to promote individual liberty and competition. However, Wilson was also known for his controversial views on race.\n\nWilson spoke out against segregation in his early political career, but he later came to support it. As President, Wilson segregated the federal workforce and allowed for the re-segregation of certain federal facilities, such as the Navy.\n\nGiven Wilson's support for segregation, it is likely that he would have supported the Plessy v. Ferguson decision. While Wilson's views on race evolved over time, it is clear that he was not a steadfast supporter of racial equality. Therefore, answer (A) is the correct choice."

This landmark Supreme Court ruling in 1896 upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation laws under the doctrine of \"separate but equal.\" It meant that public facilities such as schools, transportation, and restrooms could be legally segregated as long as they were deemed equal in quality. \n\nNow, let's consider Woodrow Wilson's views on race relations. Wilson was the 28th president of the United States and served from 1913 to 1921. He was known for his progressive policies, including the creation of the Federal Reserve System and the signing of the Clayton Antitrust Act. However, Wilson was also criticized for his racial views and policies, which included the segregation of federal offices and the exclusion of African Americans from federal jobs. He even screened the controversial film \"The Birth of a Nation,\" which glorified the Ku Klux Klan and depicted African Americans as inferior.\n\nGiven Wilson's record on segregation and his views on race, it is likely that he would have supported the Plessy v. Ferguson decision. He may have viewed segregation as a way to maintain social order and prevent racial conflict. Additionally, Wilson's policies on race were aligned with the prevailing attitudes of the time, which saw African Americans as second-class citizens. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, Woodrow Wilson would support Plessy v.

Therefore, it is likely that Wilson would have supported the Plessy v.

Woodrow Wilson was the 28th President of the United States from 1913 to 1921. He was a Democrat and a Southern politician who grew up during the Reconstruction era after the Civil War. Although he was progressive in some regards, he also had some racial biases and beliefs that were common during his time.\n\nDespite this, it is likely that Wilson would support the Plessy v. Ferguson decision because he was a product of the Jim Crow era in the South, where segregation was an accepted social norm. Additionally, as President, Wilson was primarily focused on foreign policy and did not make significant moves towards civil rights reform. He even allowed segregation to occur within certain government agencies during his administration, such as the Post Office and the Navy.\n\nTherefore, based on Wilson's background and beliefs, it can be concluded that he would support the Plessy v.
