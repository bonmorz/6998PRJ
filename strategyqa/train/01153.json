A fortnight is a period of two weeks. \n\nSo, can Centurylink max internet plan upload 1000GB in a fortnight? To answer this, we need to convert GB (gigabytes) to Mbps. \n\n1 GB = 8,000 Mb (megabits) \n\nSo 1000GB = 8,000,000 Mb \n\nNow, we can calculate if the max internet plan can upload 8,000,000 Mb in two weeks. \n\nThere are 14 days in a fortnight, so we can divide 8,000,000 Mb by 14 to get an approximate daily upload rate. \n\n8,000,000/14 = 571,428.57 Mb per day \n\nSince the max internet plan offers speeds up to 940 Mbps upload, it is clear that the plan can certainly upload 571,428.57 Mb per day. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes, the Centurylink max internet plan can upload 1000GB in a fortnight."

A fortnight is a period of two weeks.\n\nNow, let's focus on the question. Can Centurylink max internet plan upload 1000GB in a fortnight? To answer this, we need to calculate how much data can be uploaded in a fortnight based on the plan's upload speed.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the data usage from GB to Mbps. 1000GB is equal to 8000 Mbps (1 GB = 8 Mbps).\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much data can be uploaded in a second based on the plan's upload speed. The upload speed is 940 Mbps, which means that 940 megabits can be uploaded in one second.\n\nNow, we can calculate how much data can be uploaded in a fortnight (which is equal to 1209600 seconds). We need to multiply the upload speed by the number of seconds in a fortnight: 940 Mbps x 1209600 seconds = 1139744000 megabits (or approximately 1.14 terabits).\n\nFinally, we need to convert the total data usage from megabits to gigabytes. The total data usage is 1139744000 megabits, which is equal to 142468000 GB (1 terabit = 1000 gigabits).\n\nTherefore, based on our calculations, Centurylink max internet plan can upload approximately 142468000 GB of data in a fortnight, which is more than 1000GB. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."
