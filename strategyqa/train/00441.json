Maroon 5, on the other hand, formed in 1994 but did not become commercially successful until the early 2000s.\n\nTherefore, it is highly unlikely that they went on tour together since Nirvana disbanded before Maroon 5's rise to fame.

Nirvana was an American rock band from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, while Maroon 5 is a pop band that formed in the early 2000s. This means that their active periods didn't overlap.\n\nNext, we need to check whether any tour or concert events ever featured both bands. We can do this by checking the official tour schedules or performing an online search. However, this research will yield that Maroon 5 never went on tour with Nirvana, as they were both active in different eras, and Nirvana disbanded years before Maroon 5's formation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no. Maroon 5 and Nirvana never went on tour together because they were active at different times in music history."
