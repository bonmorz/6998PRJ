Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born on December 18, 1863, and was assassinated on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo, Bosnia. He was a member of Austria-Hungary's ruling family, and his assassination sparked the events that led to the outbreak of World War I.\n\nTaking these two pieces of information together, we can confidently say that Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria did not participate in the Pacific War. This is because he died in 1914, several decades before the Pacific War even began. So, the correct answer is (B) no."
