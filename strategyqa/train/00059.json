Topa Inca Yupanqui was the tenth Sapa Inca, or emperor, of the Inca Empire, who ruled from 1471 to 1493. \n\nNext, we need to consider the natural range of the western honey bee, Apis mellifera. The western honey bee originated in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, and has since been introduced to various other parts of the world, including the Americas. \n\nHowever, it is unlikely that the western honey bee would have been present in South America during the time of the Inca Empire. The honey bee was not native to the region, and there is no evidence to suggest that it was intentionally introduced by humans during this time. \n\nFurthermore, the Inca Empire was primarily located in the Andes Mountains, which are not a suitable habitat for honey bees. Honey bees require relatively flat areas with abundant flowering plants, which are not typically found at high elevations. \n\nTherefore, based on the historical and natural context, we can determine that it is unlikely that Topa Inca Yupanqui would have encountered the western honey bee during his reign, making answer (B) the correct choice."

Second, we need to consider the distribution of the western honey bee, also known as the European honey bee or Apis mellifera. This species is native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa, but it has been introduced to many other parts of the world, including the Americas. However, the historical records suggest that the western honey bee was not present in the Andes region of South America, where the Inca Empire was located, until the arrival of the Europeans in the 16th century. Therefore, we can infer that Topa Inca Yupanqui would not have encountered the western honey bee during his lifetime, and the correct answer is (B) no."
