Ahura Mazda is the supreme deity of Zoroastrianism, a monotheistic faith practiced in Iran and parts of central Asia. \n\nNext, let's understand what a mosque is. A mosque is a place of worship for Muslims, who practice the Islamic faith. \n\nNow, it's important to note that Zoroastrianism and Islam are two distinct religions with their own beliefs, practices, and places of worship. Muslims worship Allah at a mosque, while Zoroastrians worship Ahura Mazda in a fire temple. \n\nTherefore, it is not appropriate or acceptable to worship Ahura Mazda at a mosque, as it goes against the teachings and practices of both religions. So, the correct answer is (B) no."

Mosques are places of worship for Muslims and are usually reserved for the worship of Allah. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to worship Ahura Mazda at a mosque, as it goes against the beliefs and practices of Islam. Additionally, Zoroastrianism has its own places of worship known as fire temples, where Ahura Mazda is worshipped. So, the answer to this question is (B) no."

                "content": "First, it is important to understand who Ahura Mazda is. Ahura Mazda is the name of the God in Zoroastrianism, which is a monotheistic religion that originated in ancient Persia (now Iran) over 3,000 years ago.\n\nMosques, on the other hand, are places of worship for Muslims, who follow Islam - another monotheistic religion that originated in the Arabian Peninsula around 1,400 years ago.\n\nSo, the simple answer is no - you cannot worship Ahura Mazda at a mosque. This is because mosques are dedicated places of worship for Muslims, where they perform their religious rituals and offer prayers five times a day. It would not be appropriate or respectful to perform rituals related to another religion in a mosque meant solely for Muslim worship.\n\nAdditionally, the Islamic understanding of God differs from that of Zoroastrianism. Muslims believe in the Oneness of God and worship Allah (God) alone. Any form of polytheism or associating partners with Allah is considered a major sin in Islam. Similarly, in Zoroastrianism, Ahura Mazda is believed to be the creator and sustainer of the universe, and worshipping any other deity is considered a sin.\n\nIn conclusion, while both religions share some similarities, they have different beliefs and practices. Therefore, it would not be appropriate or permissible to worship Ahura Mazda at a mosque, which is exclusively meant for Muslim worship."

Zoroastrians believe in one supreme god, Ahura Mazda, and they worship him in fire temples.\n\nOn the other hand, a mosque is a place of worship for Muslims. Muslims believe in Allah as their one and only deity, and they perform their prayers in mosques.\n\nSo, considering the above information, it is not possible to worship Ahura Mazda in a mosque. Mosques are exclusively meant for Islamic prayers and cannot be used for worshiping other deities. Hence, the answer to the question is (B), no."
