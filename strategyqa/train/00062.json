According to Greek mythology, a chimera is a monster made up of the parts of different animals, usually consisting of a lion, goat, and serpent. \n\nNow, let's take a look at the Capricorn astrology symbol. It is represented by the sea-goat, which is a creature that has the upper body of a goat and the lower body of a fish or sea creature. \n\nSo, the Capricorn astrology symbol does not have all of the parts of a chimera. It only has the upper body of one of the animals, the goat, and the lower body of a completely different animal, the fish. Therefore, the answer is (B) no."

In Greek mythology, it is a creature that is composed of parts from different animals - usually a lion, goat, and serpent. In astrology, the Capricorn symbol is often depicted as a sea goat, which is a combination of a goat and a fish.\n\nSo, in order to answer the question, we need to compare the parts of a chimera with the parts of the Capricorn symbol. A chimera has three parts - a lion, goat, and serpent. The Capricorn symbol only has two parts - a goat and a fish.
