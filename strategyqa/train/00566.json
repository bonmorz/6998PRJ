Next, we need to determine the origin of potatoes. Potatoes were first cultivated in South America, specifically the Andes region, around 7,000-10,000 years ago. They were not introduced to Europe until the 16th century when Spanish explorers brought them over from South America. Therefore, we can conclude that potatoes are not native to the European continent, making answer (B) the correct answer."
