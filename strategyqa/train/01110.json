It provides tools, resources, and features that developers can use to create their games. \n\nNow, let's consider what a fuel injector is. A fuel injector is a component in an internal combustion engine that injects fuel into the engine's cylinders. Its purpose is to provide fuel to the engine so that it can function properly. \n\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that a game engine does not have a fuel injector. A game engine is a software framework, while a fuel injector is a mechanical component of an internal combustion engine.
