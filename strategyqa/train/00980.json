Apartheid was a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination that existed in South Africa from 1948 until the early 1990s. \n\nNext, we need to determine if Elle Fanning played a role in ending apartheid. The answer to this is no. Elle Fanning was not involved in any capacity in the movement to end apartheid in South Africa. The movement was primarily led by activists, politicians, and organizations such as the African National Congress (ANC) and the United Democratic Front (UDF), who fought against the laws and policies that perpetuated racial discrimination and segregation. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Elle Fanning did not play an essential part in ending apartheid."

Therefore, it is highly unlikely that she could have played any role in ending apartheid. \n\nSecondly, apartheid was a political system of racial segregation enforced by the government of South Africa for over 50 years. It was ultimately dismantled through the collective efforts of a number of individuals, political parties, and movements within South Africa, as well as international pressure and sanctions from other countries.\n\nLastly, while Elle Fanning is a well-known actress who has starred in a number of films and TV shows over the years, there is no evidence to suggest that she played any role whatsoever in the ending of apartheid. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Elle Fanning did not play an essential part in ending apartheid, and this conclusion can be reached through careful reasoning and elimination of inaccurate or unlikely possibilities."

It is widely known that the movement to end apartheid was led by South African activists such as Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu, as well as international leaders and organizations.\n\nElle Fanning is an American actress who was born in 1998. This means that she was not even born when apartheid officially ended in South Africa in the early 1990s.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently conclude that Elle Fanning did not play an essential part in ending apartheid, and the correct answer is (B) no."

Elle Fanning is an American actress born in 1998, which means she was not alive during the time when apartheid was in place in South Africa. Thus, it is highly unlikely that she played an essential part in ending apartheid. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, and the explanation is that Elle Fanning did not play an essential part in ending apartheid because she was not alive during that time period."

Elle Fanning (born April 9, 1998) is an American actress. She began acting in films at a young age, and has since starred in a number of movies, including Maleficent, Super 8, and The Neon Demon.\n\nBased on this information, we can safely say that Elle Fanning did not play an essential part in ending apartheid. Elle Fanning was born in 1998 - long after apartheid ended in South Africa. Therefore, her presence and actions had no impact on ending apartheid. The answer to this question is (B) no."

So, it's unlikely that Elle Fanning was old enough to play a role in ending apartheid. \n\nFurthermore, apartheid was brought to an end primarily through the efforts of South African activists and leaders, such as Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk, who negotiated together to bring about a peaceful transition to democracy. While many people around the world (including celebrities) supported the anti-apartheid movement and spoke out against apartheid, it would be inaccurate to say that any one person, let alone a young American actress, played an essential part in ending it. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no. Elle Fanning did not play an essential part in ending apartheid."
