The gestation period for an elephant is approximately 22 months, meaning that a pregnancy beginning in 2020 would end in 2022. Therefore, we can conclude that the 2020 elephant pregnancy will not last past next year (2021). \n\nSecondly, the presence of 4 solar eclipses next year is not relevant to the duration of elephant pregnancies. While the timing and frequency of solar eclipses can have various cultural or symbolic meanings, they do not have any biological impact on elephant gestation periods. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, and the explanation is based on the facts about elephant biology and the unrelated nature of solar eclipses."

Therefore, the pregnancy that starts in 2020 will most likely end in 2022, which means it will not last past next year (2021). \n\nAdditionally, the occurrence of 4 solar eclipses in a year does not have any effect on the duration of an elephant pregnancy. While some people believe that solar eclipses can influence or affect various events on earth, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, and the explanation is based on the biological facts of elephant pregnancy and the lack of impact of solar eclipses on the pregnancy duration."

Therefore, if an elephant got pregnant in the year 2020, the pregnancy would last until around mid-2022. \n\nNext, let's consider the solar eclipses. Solar eclipses occur when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth and blocks the sun's rays. They happen when the Moon is in its new moon phase, which occurs about every 29.5 days. \n\nIn 2020, there were two solar eclipses - one on June 21 and one on December 14. In 2021, there will also be two solar eclipses - one on June 10 and one on December 4. \n\nHowever, the occurrence of solar eclipses has no impact on the length of an elephant's pregnancy. Whether there are 4 solar eclipses or zero solar eclipses in a particular year has no bearing on how long an elephant's pregnancy will last. Therefore, we can confidently answer that the 2020 elephant pregnancy will not last past next year with 4 solar eclipses, and the correct answer is (B) no."

Therefore, if an elephant conceived in 2020, its pregnancy would naturally extend into 2021 and potentially even further. So, the answer to this part of the question is yes. \n\nHowever, the second part of the question brings up the occurrence of four solar eclipses. Solar eclipses are simply events where the moon passes between the Sun and Earth, casting a shadow on Earth's surface. They have no direct connection to elephant pregnancy or its duration. Therefore, the answer to whether the 2020 elephant pregnancy will last past next year with four solar eclipses should be no, as the solar eclipses have no bearing on the length of the pregnancy. \n\nIn summary, while elephant pregnancy can naturally last beyond one year, the presence of solar eclipses does not impact this.
