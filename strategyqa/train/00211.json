This information can be found through research, such as browsing through news articles or the official website of the Golden Globe awards. Once we have a list of winners, we can then look up if any of them attended John Kerry's alma mater. To do this, we need to know where Kerry went to school. Again, we can easily find this information through research. Once we know that Kerry attended Yale University, we can then search for the names of the Golden Globe winners who also attended Yale. If we find at least one winner who attended Yale, then the answer to the question is yes. If we find none, then the answer is no. In this case, we have found at least one Golden Globe winner who attended Yale, so the answer is (A) yes."
