The University of Houston is located in Houston, Texas, which is a highly urbanized area with a large population.

It is not typically found in the United States, including Texas where the University of Houston is located.\n\nNext, we need to consider the habitat and behavior of caracals. Caracals live in a variety of habitats including forests, grasslands, and savannas. They are also solitary animals that hunt mainly at night.\n\nSince caracals are not native to the United States and the campus of the University of Houston is not located in the types of habitats where caracals are known to live, it is highly unlikely that a student at the University of Houston would see a caracal on campus. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

It is extremely unlikely for a caracal to be found on a university campus in Houston, Texas, as that is far outside of their natural habitat. Additionally, caracals are not typically kept as pets or used in research at universities, further decreasing the likelihood of one being seen on campus. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

Therefore, even if a caracal were to somehow find its way onto campus, it would likely be quickly removed or dealt with by the authorities.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (B) no, a student at the University of Houston is unlikely to see a caracal on campus."

It is not typically found in North America, let alone Texas where the University of Houston is located. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a caracal would be on campus. \nSecondly, even if a caracal somehow made its way to the University of Houston, it would be unlikely for it to be seen by a student. The campus is quite large, covering over 600 acres, and there are many buildings, walkways, and green spaces that a caracal could easily hide in. Additionally, caracals are typically nocturnal and solitary animals, so they tend to avoid humans and stay hidden during the day. \nBased on these reasons, the answer to the question is (B) no, a student at the University of Houston is not likely to see a caracal on campus."
