They do not provide sufficient warmth or protection for the feet. Wearing sandals would expose the feet to the harsh elements, which could lead to frostbite, hypothermia, and other serious health risks.\n\nStep 4: Based on the above information, we can conclude that it is not comfortable or safe to wear sandals outside Esperanza Base. The correct answer is (B) no. It is essential to wear appropriate footwear, such as insulated boots or shoes, to protect the feet and keep them warm in these harsh conditions."

Esperanza Base is located on the Antarctic Peninsula, which is known to have one of the harshest climates in the world. The temperature can drop as low as -50\u00b0C, and the winds can reach up to 200 km/h. \n\nNow, let's look at the footwear option. Sandals are open-toed footwear, which means they do not provide any protection to the toes, sole, or ankle. In such a harsh environment, it is not advisable to wear open-toed sandals as they do not provide any warmth, insulation or protection. \n\nAdditionally, the terrain around the base is likely to be rugged and icy, making it dangerous to wear sandals. Sandals don't provide any grip or stability on slippery surfaces, which can increase the risk of slips and falls, leading to injuries.\n\nTherefore, based on the climate, terrain, and footwear option, it is not comfortable to wear sandals outside Esperanza Base. Hence, the correct answer is (B) no."
