Secondly, Chinese is not a commonly spoken language in Brazil, which further decreases the probability of the anchors speaking this language. Lastly, there has been no official news or reports suggesting that the anchors on Rede Globo speak Chinese. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, as speaking Chinese is not a requirement for being an anchor at Rede Globo, and the language is not typically used on the network."
