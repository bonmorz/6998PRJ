It is based on units of ten, and each unit is either a multiple or fraction of ten. \n\nNext, we need to understand what the term \"foot\" means. The foot is a unit of measurement used in the imperial system, which is mainly used in the United States. It is defined as 12 inches. \n\nTherefore, since the foot is not a unit of measurement in the metric system, the answer is (B) no."
