It is caused by damage to parts of the brain that control movement during development. Slime mold, on the other hand, is a type of fungus-like organism that feeds on decaying matter in the soil or on plants.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that slime mold is not related to cerebral palsy in any way. Therefore, it is safe from cerebral palsy, and the answer to the question is (A) yes.\n\nIt is important to note that while slime mold is safe from cerebral palsy, it can still be harmful to some individuals if they have allergies or respiratory issues. Additionally, some species of slime mold are toxic if ingested. Therefore, it is always important to handle and interact with slime mold with caution and to seek medical attention if any adverse reactions occur."

It is caused by damage to the developing brain, often before birth or during the first few months of life.\n\nNow, let's consider what a slime mold is. A slime mold is a type of fungus-like organism that is not harmful to humans. It does not have a brain or nervous system, so it cannot develop cerebral palsy.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes - a slime mold is safe from cerebral palsy as it cannot develop the disorder due to its lack of a brain and nervous system."

It is caused by damage to the brain before, during, or shortly after birth. \n\nNext, we need to understand what a slime mold is. A slime mold is a type of organism that is not a fungus, plant, or animal. Slime molds are typically found in moist environments and feed on bacteria and other microorganisms. \n\nNow, we can answer the question. Is a slime mold safe from cerebral palsy? The answer is yes. Slime molds, being a type of organism, are not susceptible to cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy is a human disorder that affects the brain and nervous system. Slime molds do not have a brain or nervous system, so they cannot develop cerebral palsy. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, a slime mold is safe from cerebral palsy."

A slime mold is a type of protist that is made up of single-celled organisms that function as a multicellular organism. \n\nNext, let's define cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy is a group of neurological disorders that affect movement, coordination, and balance. It is caused by damage to the brain, usually during development or infancy. \n\nNow, let's consider whether a slime mold can be affected by cerebral palsy. Since cerebral palsy is a disorder that affects humans, and slime molds are not humans, it is safe to say that a slime mold cannot develop cerebral palsy. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, a slime mold is safe from cerebral palsy."
