Next, we need to consider what types of food are typically served during this celebration. Diwali is a time when many different sweets and savory snacks are prepared, such as samosas, laddoos, and gulab jamun. \n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about whether a crustacean could be featured in the celebration. Crustaceans are creatures like lobsters, crabs, and shrimp that are typically not consumed by Hindus because they are considered unclean according to their religious beliefs.\n\nDespite this, there are some parts of India where people do eat certain types of crustaceans, particularly prawns. Additionally, there are some non-Hindu communities in India that may include crustaceans in their Diwali celebrations, or who may celebrate Diwali but not follow the strict dietary restrictions typically observed by Hindus.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (A), yes, it is possible for a Diwali celebration to feature a crustacean depending on the specific circumstances and dietary practices of those hosting or participating in the celebration."
