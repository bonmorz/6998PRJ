He is the nephew of King Theoden, and the leader of the Riders of Rohan. \n\nNext, we need to establish who Gandalf is. Gandalf is also a character in \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. He is a wizard and a member of the Fellowship of the Ring. \n\nNow, we need to think about the events that occur in \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. Eomer dies in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, which takes place in the third book of the trilogy, \"The Return of the King\". \n\nGandalf is present during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. However, he is not present at the exact moment of Eomer's death. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no, Gandalf was not present at the death of Eomer."

Gandalf is a wizard in The Lord of the Rings, and he is a key character who helps Frodo and his companions on their journey to destroy the One Ring.\n\nNow to answer the question. Was Gandalf present at the death of Eomer? The answer is no. Eomer does eventually die, but Gandalf is not present for his death.\n\nIt is important to note that Eomer does not die in the books, but rather in the film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Even in the film, however, there is no scene indicating that Gandalf is present for Eomer's death. \n\nSo, in summary, we can confidently say that the answer to the question \"Was Gandalf present at the death of Eomer?\" is no."

Eomer is a Rohirrim warrior, who becomes the King of Rohan. \nNow, let's consider the question. The question is asking whether Gandalf was present at the death of Eomer or not. \nTo answer this question, we need to recall events from the stories that involve both Gandalf and Eomer. \nHowever, there is no known instance in the stories where Eomer dies and Gandalf is present. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) no. \nIt is important to analyze the information given in the question and separate it from any other knowledge that one may have about the characters, in order to arrive at the correct answer."

Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" series, specifically in the third book, \"The Return of the King.\" Eomer is the nephew of King Theoden of Rohan, and he becomes the King of Rohan after Theoden's death.\n\nNext, we need to think about when Eomer dies. The answer choices don't give us any time frame, so we need to rely on our knowledge of the books. Eomer is killed in battle during the Battle of Pelennor Fields, which takes place towards the end of \"The Return of the King.\"\n\nFinally, we need to think about whether Gandalf was present at this battle. We know that Gandalf is a major character in the books and is involved in many important events. However, he is not always present for every battle or event. In this case, we can confirm that Gandalf was indeed present at the Battle of Pelennor Fields. In fact, he played a crucial role in helping to turn the tide of the battle.\n\nTherefore, if we put all of these pieces together, we can confidently choose answer choice (B) \"no\" as incorrect, because Gandalf was present at the Battle of Pelennor Fields where Eomer dies. This means that answer choice (A) \"yes\" must be correct, and Gandalf was indeed present at Eomer's death."

However, based on the fact that Eomer is alive at the end of the story and there is no specific mention of Gandalf being present at his death, we can confidently answer that Gandalf was not present at the death of Eomer. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."

In fact, Eomer survives until the end of the story, and he eventually becomes the king of Rohan after his uncle's death.\n\nTherefore, we can determine that the answer to this question is (B) no, Gandalf was not present at the death of Eomer.
