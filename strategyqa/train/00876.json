Moss, on the other hand, is a type of plant that grows in a variety of environments, including forests, marshes and rocks. Moss does not grow on humans.

While both may grow on a human (if the person has a beard or spends time in a place with moss), they are two completely different things. So, the correct answer is (B) no, a beard is not moss that grows on a human."
