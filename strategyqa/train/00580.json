This means that whenever you exert yourself beyond the point where oxygen is readily available to your muscles, your body breaks down carbohydrates into lactic acid as an alternative source of energy. So, in moderate amounts, lactic acid is not bad for you as it is a natural and necessary part of the body's energy production process. \n\nHowever, too much lactic acid can be harmful or even life-threatening, a condition known as lactic acidosis. This happens when there is an excess of lactic acid in the bloodstream due to various factors such as liver dysfunction, infection or lack of oxygen, and can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, nausea, and even coma or death. \n\nIn sum, it is not inherently bad to have lactic acid in your body, but having too much of it can be dangerous. It depends on the context and amount of lactic acid present in your body."
