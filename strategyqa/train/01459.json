Glen Beck is a conservative talk radio host and political commentator, while Stephen Colbert is a liberal TV personality and comedian. \n\nNext, we need to think about their ideologies and types of content they produce. Glen Beck's content tends to be more serious and political, focused on conservative values and current events. Stephen Colbert, on the other hand, is known for his satirical style and making fun of political figures, particularly those on the conservative side. \n\nConsidering their differing ideologies and styles of content, it is unlikely that Glen Beck and Stephen Colbert would tour together. Their audiences and content are different, and it's unlikely that fans of one would be interested in the other. Additionally, their differing political views may cause conflict on tour. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

Glen Beck is a conservative political commentator and radio host, known for his controversial opinions and criticism of liberal ideals. Stephen Colbert, on the other hand, is a liberal political satirist and comedian, who often uses humor to comment on current events and politics.\n\nGiven their different political views and approaches to commentary, it is highly unlikely that they would tour together. In fact, it would be quite surprising if they did, as they are generally seen as representing opposite sides of the political spectrum. Thus, the correct answer is (B) no."
