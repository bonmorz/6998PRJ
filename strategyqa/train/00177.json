This means that they would not have been old enough to have memories of 9/11 since they were only 2-3 years old at the time. Furthermore, the event would not have been a part of their early childhood education since it occurred before they entered school. Therefore, it is likely that a student of the class of 2017 would have amnesia about 9/11. Hence, the answer is (A) yes."

This means that they would have been born around 1999 or 2000, depending on their birth month. \n\nNext, we need to determine what 9/11 refers to. This is the common shorthand for the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, in New York City. \n\nBased on these facts, we can conclude that a student of the class of 2017 would not have been born yet at the time of the attacks. Therefore, they would not have any personal memories of the event. \n\nHowever, this question is asking specifically about amnesia, which means the loss of memory. It is possible that a student of the class of 2017 could have learned about 9/11 through books, videos, classroom discussions, or conversations with family and friends. \n\nOverall, the answer to this question is (A) yes, a student of the class of 2017 would technically have amnesia about 9/11 in terms of personal experience, but they could still know about the event through other means."

Therefore, we can conclude that a student of the class of 2017 may have amnesia (the partial or total loss of memory) about 9/11. Answer is (A) yes."

Therefore, we can assume that the class of 2017 graduated in June of 2017. \n\nNext, we need to consider the date of the 9/11 attacks. September 11th, 2001 is a well-known and documented historical event. Therefore, we can conclude that the attacks occurred before the class of 2017 was even born. \n\nBased on these two pieces of information alone, we can infer that a student of the class of 2017 would not have any personal recollection or experience of the 9/11 attacks. However, this does not necessarily mean they have amnesia about the event. \n\nAmnesia is a medical condition that impairs a person's ability to remember and recall information. It is unlikely that an entire graduating class would have amnesia about a well-known historical event, especially one that occurred before they were even born.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, the answer is (A) yes, a student of the class of 2017 would not have personal recollection or experience of the 9/11 attacks, but it is not accurate to say they would have amnesia about it."

For example, if the current year is 2021, the graduation year of the class of 2017 would be 2017. \n\nNext, we need to determine if this class would have been born at the time of 9/11. 9/11 occurred on September 11th, 2001. If we subtract 18 from 2001, we get the year 1983, which means that the class of 2017 is likely to have been born in or after the year 2001. \n\nTherefore, students from the class of 2017 would not have been born at the time of 9/11, and therefore would not have personally experienced or remembered the event. It is possible that they may have learned about it through family members or in school, but they would not have been able to remember it themselves. Thus, the correct answer is (A) yes, a student from the class of 2017 would have amnesia about 9/11."
