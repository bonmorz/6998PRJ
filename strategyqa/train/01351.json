Next, we need to determine the height of the Statue of Liberty and compare it to the depth of Bohai Sea. The Statue of Liberty is approximately 93 meters tall. The maximum depth of Bohai Sea is about 102 meters. \n\nTherefore, if the Statue of Liberty was completely submerged in Bohai Sea, the top of the statue would be 9 meters above the surface of the water. This means that the Statue of Liberty would still be visible if it were submerged in the Bohai Sea. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

The Statue of Liberty stands at approximately 93 meters tall, including its pedestal. \n\nTherefore, even if we assume that the entire height of the statue is submerged underwater (which is not the case), it would still be visible from the surface because it is taller than the visibility range in Bohai Sea.

Therefore, it is impossible for the Statue of Liberty to be submerged in the Bohai Sea. \n\nSince the Statue of Liberty is not in the Bohai Sea, it would not matter if it is visible or not. However, for the sake of answering the question, we can say that if the Statue of Liberty was somehow submerged in the Bohai Sea, it would still be visible since the water in the Bohai Sea is not very deep and the statue is quite tall (roughly 151 feet). Therefore, the answer is (A) - yes, the Statue of Liberty would be visible if submerged in the Bohai Sea."

Secondly, the Statue of Liberty is located in New York Harbor, which is on the east coast of the United States. \n\nNow, if we assume that the Statue of Liberty is fully submerged in the Bohai Sea, then it would not be visible from the surface. This is because the statue is made of copper and iron, and these materials would corrode and rust when exposed to seawater for an extended period of time. Therefore, the statue would be covered in rust and marine growth, making it impossible to see. \n\nHowever, if we assume that the Statue of Liberty is placed on the seabed of the Bohai Sea, then it might be possible to see it if someone is diving down to that level. The visibility underwater would depend upon the turbidity of the water and the depth of the seabed. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer to this question would be (A) yes, the Statue of Liberty would be visible if it is placed on the seabed of the Bohai Sea."
