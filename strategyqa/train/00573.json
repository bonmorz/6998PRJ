Lobsters cannot breathe in air like land animals since their respiratory system is adapted to extract oxygen from water.\nNext, we need to consider the environment of a desert. Deserts are extremely dry and arid regions where there is little to no water. Hence, there is no suitable habitat for a lobster. As lobsters cannot survive in such conditions, they will not be able to breathe in a desert.\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) no, lobsters cannot breathe in the desert, as they are adapted to survive in underwater environments."

In the desert, the air is very dry, and there is very little moisture present. This means that any moisture in a lobster's gills would quickly evaporate, rendering the gills useless for breathing. \n\nFurthermore, lobsters are marine animals, which means that they are adapted to live in saltwater environments. The desert is a completely different environment with different temperature, humidity, and terrain. Lobsters would not be able to survive in the desert without significant adaptation, such as being exposed to a controlled environment with adequate moisture and ventilation.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (B) no, lobsters cannot breathe in the desert because the dry desert air would cause their gills to dry out and prevent them from breathing."

Therefore, it is safe to say that lobsters cannot breathe in the desert, and the correct answer is (B) no."
