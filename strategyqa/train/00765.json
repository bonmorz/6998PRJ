There are 64 colleges and universities within the SUNY system.\n\nStep 2: What is a doctorate?\nA doctorate is the highest academic degree that can be earned in a specific field.

While some academic positions may require a doctorate degree, there are many other positions that only require a master's degree or a combination of academic and professional experience.\n\nStep 4: What are the requirements to teach at a SUNY school?\nThe requirements to teach at a SUNY school will vary depending on the position and the school. Generally, a minimum of a master's degree is required, though some positions may require a doctorate degree. In addition to academic qualifications, teaching experience and professional experience may also be considered.\n\nStep 5: What is the answer to the question?\nThe answer to the question is (B) no, a doctorate is not required to teach at a SUNY school. While some academic positions may require a doctorate degree, there are many other positions that only require a master's degree or a combination of academic and professional experience."

If we are referring to teaching at the college level (i.e. as a professor), then the answer may differ from teaching at the K-12 level (i.e. as a teacher). \n\nAssuming we are discussing teaching at the college level, a doctorate (Ph.D. or equivalent) is not always required to teach at a SUNY school. While many faculty members do hold a doctorate, those with a master's degree or other advanced degree may also be qualified to teach depending on the specific requirements for the position. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, a doctorate is not always required to teach at a SUNY school."

SUNY stands for State University of New York, which is a system of publicly-funded institutions of higher education in the state of New York. Therefore, a SUNY School is a school that is part of this system.\n\nNext, we need to consider whether a doctorate is required to teach at a SUNY School. The answer is no. While some positions at a SUNY School may require a doctorate, such as a professor in a highly specialized field, not all teaching positions require one. For example, some adjunct or part-time faculty positions may only require a master's degree.\n\nIn conclusion, a doctorate is not universally required to teach at a SUNY School. It depends on the specific position and the requirements for that role."

While some positions may require it, it is not a universal requirement across all positions. A master's degree is typically the minimum educational requirement for most professor positions at SUNY schools."
