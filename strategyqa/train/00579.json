The important factor for a bartender is whether or not the person is of legal drinking age. Millie Bobby Brown is not legally allowed to consume alcohol in the United States, as she is under 21 years old. Therefore, a responsible bartender would not make a drink for her. \n\nAdditionally, even if she were of legal drinking age, a responsible bartender would take into account any visible signs of intoxication or potential harm to the customer and those around them. A bartender's priority is to ensure the safety and well-being of all customers, and making a drink simply because someone is famous would not align with that responsibility."

As a responsible bartender, it is their duty to ensure that they do not serve alcohol to underage individuals. \n\nSecondly, serving alcohol to someone who is visibly intoxicated or drunk is also considered irresponsible and illegal in most places. As a bartender, they have a responsibility to keep their customers safe and prevent them from potentially harming themselves or others. \n\nBased on these factors, it is safe to say that a responsible bartender would not make a drink for Millie Bobby Brown, or any underage individual, and would instead ask for identification and refuse service if necessary. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) no."
