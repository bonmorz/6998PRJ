She is an Australian actress and producer who has been active in Hollywood for several decades. \n\nNext, we need to understand what Scientologists are. Scientology is a religion founded by American science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. It has been the subject of controversy and criticism due to its practices and beliefs. \n\nFinally, we need to determine whether Nicole Kidman knows any Scientologists. There are several pieces of evidence that suggest she does. \n\nFirstly, Nicole Kidman was married to Tom Cruise from 1990 to 2001. Tom Cruise is one of the most famous Scientologists in the world and has been a member of the religion since the 1980s. \n\nSecondly, Nicole Kidman has talked publicly about her experience with Scientology. In a 2013 interview with Vanity Fair, she said that she had been \"personally affected by Scientology\" during her marriage to Cruise. She also said that she had chosen not to speak publicly about her feelings towards the religion and that \"I have two children who are Scientologists - Connor and Isabella - and I utterly respect their beliefs.\" \n\nBased on this evidence, we can confidently say that the answer to the question is (A) yes, Nicole Kidman does know Scientologists."

Next, we need to know what Scientology is. Scientology is a controversial organization founded by science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard in the 1950s. It is known for its secretive practices and aggressive legal tactics against its critics.\n\nNow referring back to the question, \"Does Nicole Kidman know any Scientologists?\", the answer is yes. This is because Kidman was married to Tom Cruise, who is a prominent member of the Scientology community. Although the couple divorced in 2001, Kidman has been vocal about her lack of involvement with Scientology and has distanced herself from the organization. In a 2013 interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Kidman stated that she respects people's beliefs but does not have any affiliation with Scientology."

So, it is possible for Nicole Kidman to know a Scientologist even if she does not necessarily support or practice Scientology herself.\nSecondly, Nicole Kidman's past marriage to Tom Cruise, a known Scientologist, is a significant piece of information to consider. Although the couple got divorced in 2001, Kidman and Cruise were married for a decade and likely had some exposure to Scientology during their time together. Moreover, Kidman has spoken publicly about her experience with Cruise's involvement in Scientology and how it impacted their marriage.\nThirdly, there are other celebrities in Hollywood who openly embrace and advocate for Scientology, and they might have interacted with Kidman through social or professional circles. For instance, John Travolta, Elisabeth Moss, and Kirstie Alley are all significant names associated with Scientology who have also worked in the film industry.\nGiven all these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that Nicole Kidman has knowledge or acquaintance with Scientologists, rendering option A the correct answer."
