The Paramount leader is a title given to the most powerful figure in the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nNext, we need to establish the production details of Titanic. James Cameron is the director and writer of Titanic, and it was produced by 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures.\n\nNow, we can answer the question. The Paramount leader, as the leader of a political party in China, has nothing to do with the production of a Hollywood movie.
