Rowing refers to the sport of propelling a boat using oars.\n- Typically, rowing takes place on water, in rivers, lakes, or oceans.\n- Indoor rowing, on the other hand, refers to using a rowing machine or ergometer to simulate the motion of rowing.\n- While indoor rowing can be a great workout, it is not a true rowing competition.\n- Rowing competitions, by definition, involve racing against other boats on a body of water.\n- Therefore, rowing competitions cannot take place indoors.

However, indoor rowing machines, also known as ergometers, are commonly used for training purposes. These machines simulate the rowing motion and provide a workout that closely mimics on-water rowing. While indoor rowing competitions do exist, they are not considered a replacement for on-water competitions and are not recognized by major rowing organizations. Therefore, the answer to the question is no, rowing competitions cannot take place indoors in the sense of replacing on-water competitions."

Based on the definition of rowing competitions, it seems unlikely that they can take place indoors since water is necessary for the activity.

Therefore, the answer to the question depends on whether an indoor space can accommodate a rowing boat and allow it to move forward with oars. \n\nSince an indoor space may not have sufficient water depth, it is unlikely that rowing competitions can take place indoors. Additionally, a rowing boat requires a considerable amount of space to move and turn, which is difficult to achieve in an indoor setting. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, rowing competitions cannot take place indoors."
