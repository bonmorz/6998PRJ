It is highly unlikely that he trained in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu or any grappling art that would include the gogoplata submission hold. Tyson's main focus was on boxing and his training would revolve around that. Additionally, even if he did learn some submission techniques, the gogoplata is not a commonly used hold in most grappling arts, making it even less likely that he would have trained specifically in it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, Mike Tyson did not train to use the gogoplata."
