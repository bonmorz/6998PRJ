Species that share a more recent common ancestor are considered more closely related than those that diverged from each other a long time ago. \n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between gorillas and humans. Both gorillas and humans are primates and belong to the same family Hominidae. This family is also known as the great apes, which includes orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, and humans. \n\nOut of all the great apes, humans share the most recent common ancestor with chimpanzees and bonobos, about 6-7 million years ago. Gorillas split off from this common ancestor about 10-12 million years ago. \n\nHowever, despite this longer divergence time, gorillas still share a significant amount of DNA with humans. In fact, scientists estimate that humans and gorillas share about 98% of their DNA sequence. \n\nTherefore, based on the similarities in our genetic makeup and primate classification, we can conclude that gorillas are closely related to humans. The answer to the question is (A) yes."

Closely related means that two species share a common ancestor relatively recently in their evolutionary history. \n\nGorillas and humans are both primates, which means that they share a lot of similarities in their physical characteristics and behaviors. This suggests that they may be closely related. \n\nTo determine the level of relatedness between two species, scientists look at their genetic makeup. Through genetic analysis, scientists have confirmed that humans and gorillas share a common ancestor that lived about 10 million years ago. This means that humans and gorillas are more closely related to each other than either is to other primates like lemurs or tarsiers. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, gorillas are closely related to humans."

Humans and gorillas both belong to the taxonomic family Hominoidea, which includes great apes and humans.

Studies have shown that the DNA sequences of humans and gorillas are highly similar, with a 98% match.
