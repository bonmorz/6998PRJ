Then we need to understand what lolcats are - they are typically humorous images of cats with captions. \n\nNow, we need to consider whether it would have been possible for Ronald Reagan to forward lolcats to his friends. Lolcats only became popular in the early 2000s with the rise of the internet and social media, which was well after Reagan's presidency ended in 1989. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Reagan would have been able to forward lolcats to his friends. \n\nFurthermore, it is important to note that Reagan was a well-respected political figure, and forwarding humorous images may not have been consistent with his professional persona. Therefore, based on the evidence, we can conclude that the answer is (B) no, Reagan did not forward lolcats to his friends."
