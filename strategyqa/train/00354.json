Therefore, we must assume that the question is referring to a specific species that has been given the name \"Leipzig.\" \n\nNext, we need to consider whether this species is an evergreen tree. To do this, we would need to have some knowledge of the characteristics of this species. However, since the question does not provide any additional information about the species, we can only make an educated guess based on the name \"Leipzig.\" \n\nSince \"evergreen\" typically refers to trees that retain their leaves or needles year-round, and \"Leipzig\" is not a name that suggests this type of tree, it is reasonable to assume that the answer is \"no,\" the tree species that the name Leipzig refers to is not an evergreen tree."
