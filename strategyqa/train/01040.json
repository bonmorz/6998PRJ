Queen Elizabeth I lived from 1533-1603 and Jean-Paul Sartre was born in 1905 and died in 1980. Therefore, it is impossible for Queen Elizabeth I to have read the works of Jean-Paul Sartre because he was not even born yet during her lifetime. Thus, the correct answer is (B) no."

She lived during the Renaissance period, which was a time of great literature and artistic development.\n\nNext, we need to establish who Jean-Paul Sartre was and when he lived. Jean-Paul Sartre was a French philosopher and writer who lived from 1905-1980. He was a prominent figure in the existentialist movement and wrote many influential works, including \"Being and Nothingness\" and \"Nausea.\"\n\nFrom this information, we can determine that there is no way that Queen Elizabeth I could have read the works of Jean-Paul Sartre. Not only did she live over 300 years before he was born, but she also did not speak French, which was the language in which his works were written. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no."

It is highly unlikely that Queen Elizabeth I, who was an English monarch, would have read or known of his works. Additionally, Sartre's most famous works were written in the 20th century, long after the death of Queen Elizabeth I. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

So, it is highly unlikely that Queen Elizabeth I would have read the works of Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\nAdditionally, Queen Elizabeth I was known for her love of literature, but her preferred reading materials were mostly classics and works of her time, such as poetry, plays, and historical texts. She was an patron of the arts, and supported the works of writers such as William Shakespeare and Edmund Spenser, but there is no evidence to suggest she had any knowledge of Sartre.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, Queen Elizabeth I did not read the works of Jean-Paul Sartre."
