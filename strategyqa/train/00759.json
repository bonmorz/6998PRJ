According to the official NYPD website, the minimum age requirement for candidates who want to become an NYPD police officer is 21 years old at the time of taking the exam. \n\nNext, we need to define who Generation Y is. Generation Y, also known as Millennials, are individuals born between the years of 1981 to 1996. \n\nTherefore, if a Generation Y member was born in the year 1996, they would currently be 25 years old (as of 2021).
