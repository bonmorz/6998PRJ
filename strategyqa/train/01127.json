It is a small and rocky moon with a diameter of only 22.2 kilometers (13.8 miles). \n\nNext, we need to consider the temperature on Phobos. Phobos has no atmosphere, so it has no protective layer to insulate it from the extreme temperatures of space. During the day, Phobos can get very hot, with temperatures reaching up to 50 \u00b0C (122 \u00b0F). However, at night, temperatures can drop to as low as -150 \u00b0C (-238 \u00b0F).\n\nNow, let's think about what this means for someone standing on Phobos. During the day, the heat may be enough to prevent you from feeling cold. However, once the sun goes down, the temperature will drop rapidly, making it critical for you to have a source of warmth. A coat or thick layer of clothing would be necessary to keep you warm and prevent hypothermia.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes, you would have to wear a coat when on Phobos."

Since Phobos is significantly closer to Mars than Earth, it is likely that the temperature on Phobos is similar to that of Mars.
