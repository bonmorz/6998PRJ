It is pinkish-grey in color and has a distinctive sulfurous smell. \n\nThe next step is to understand why black salt smells of sulfur. Black salt is formed by heating salt with various Indian spices, such as harad seeds, amla, and bahera, among others. During this process, sulfur compounds are released, giving the salt its distinctive smell. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that food made with black salt would indeed smell of sulfur. The sulfurous aroma is a characteristic feature of black salt and is prized in South Asian cuisine for its ability to add depth and complexity to dishes."

When it is added to food, it provides a unique flavor and aroma that is reminiscent of boiled eggs. This is because the sulphur compounds present in black salt are similar to those found in eggs.\n\nWhen black salt is added to food, it releases compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, which has a distinct aroma. This aroma is often described as smelling like rotten eggs or sulfur. Therefore, food made with black salt would definitely have a smell of sulfur.\n\nThus, the answer to the question is (A) Yes, food made with black salt would smell of sulfur."

For instance, many recipes that feature black salt mention the strong smell and taste that it imparts. Moreover, numerous people have commented on the smell of black salt in online discussions, with some describing it as \"eggy\" or \"funky.\" Therefore, it is safe to say that food made with black salt would indeed smell of sulfur."

It has a distinct sulfuric smell and taste.\n\nNext, let's understand the source of the sulfuric smell. The sulfuric smell in black salt comes from the presence of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the mineral. This H2S gives black salt its characteristic sulfuric smell.\n\nNow we can answer the question. Since black salt contains H2S and that gives it its distinct sulfuric smell, any food that is made with black salt would also carry that smell of sulfur.
