                "content": "First, we need to understand what Big Ben is. Big Ben is a clock tower located in London, England. The clock on Big Ben is a large and intricate timepiece that has four clock faces, each of which is about 23 feet in diameter. \n\nNow, can a blind person tell time by Big Ben? The answer is yes. Although they cannot see the clock face, they can still hear the clock chimes that sound every 15 minutes. The chimes consist of four notes which represent the number of quarters past the hour. Therefore, a blind person can listen to the chimes and count how many sets of four notes they hear to determine what time it is. \n\nIn addition, people who are blind can also use various tools to help them tell time, such as talking watches or Braille clocks. So, even if they are not in London near Big Ben, they still have options to tell time accurately."

The clock face is illuminated at night, making it visible in the darkness. \n\nSecond, while a blind person cannot see the clock face, they can still hear the chimes of Big Ben which occur every 15 minutes. This means they can keep track of the passage of time based on the number of chimes they hear. \n\nThird, there are also other ways a blind person could use to tell the time using Big Ben. For example, they could ask someone who can see the clock face to describe the time to them when they hear the chimes. Or, they could use an app on their phone that provides them with audio descriptions of the time based on the chimes of Big Ben. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (A) Yes, a blind person can tell time by Big Ben."

However, there are two ways a blind person could tell time by Big Ben:\n\n1. The clock tower chimes every quarter-hour, which a blind person could listen to and count the number of chimes to determine the time. For example, if it's 3:15, the tower will chime 3 times for the hour and then 3 more times for the first 15 minutes.\n\n2. Big Ben's clock is connected to a speaking clock service in the UK, which can be accessed by dialing a specific phone number. This service uses a recording of the clock tower chimes to indicate the time verbally, which a blind person could listen to and determine the time.\n\nTherefore, even though a blind person cannot see the clock face of Big Ben, they can still tell time by it through the chimes or the speaking clock service. The correct answer is (A) yes."

It has a large clock face visible from outside the tower. \n\nNow, to answer the question, we need to consider if a blind person can tell time using the clock face of Big Ben. \n\nAlthough a blind person can't see the clock, they can still tell time if the clock has an audible feature. In fact, Big Ben is equipped with a chiming system that rings a bell every hour. Additionally, the clock also has a \"quarter chiming\" system that rings a shorter tune every 15 minutes. These chimes can be heard from a distance, making it possible for a blind person to tell time by hearing the chimes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes, a blind person can tell time by Big Ben."

The clock face of Big Ben is uniquely designed with large, black numerals on a white background. \n\nA visually impaired individual may not be able to see the numerals on the clock face, but they can still tell time by Big Ben using other sensory cues. \n\nFor example, the clock tower chimes every 15 minutes, which can be heard from a distance. This means that a blind person can hear the chimes and count how many times it chimes to estimate the time. Additionally, Big Ben is equipped with audio cues that can help a blind person tell time by listening to specific audio patterns. \n\nTherefore, Answer (A) is correct because a blind person can tell time by Big Ben using auditory cues such as its chiming and audio signals."
