Conan O'Brien's late-night talk show typically airs at either 11:00 PM or 11:30 PM, depending on the location and network. This is well past the average bedtime for children, which is typically between 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM. Therefore, we can reasonably assume that most children would indeed be up past their bedtime if they were watching Conan O'Brien. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

So we already know that it's not a categorical statement that applies to every child.\n- The question mentions \"Conan O'Brien\", a late night talk show host who typically airs his show at 11 pm Eastern time in the United States. This time slot is after the typical bedtime for many children.\n- Based on these facts, it's reasonable to assume that many children who watch Conan O'Brien would be up past their bedtime.\n- We don't know for sure about every child, so the answer is \"yes (A)\" to indicate that it's likely or probable but not a certain fact."

Therefore, we can deduce that if children are watching his show, they are likely up late. \n\nSecondly, we need to understand children's typical bedtime. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, children aged 5-12 should sleep 9-12 hours per day, with earlier bedtimes recommended for younger children. This means that if a child's bedtime is around 9 pm, they would be up past their bedtime if they were watching Conan O'Brien's show. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes, most children would be up past their bedtime if they were watching Conan O'Brien."

According to the National Sleep Foundation, preschoolers (ages 3-5) need between 10-13 hours of sleep per day, while school-aged children (ages 6-13) need between 9-11 hours of sleep per day.\n\nNext, we need to consider the typical airing time of Conan O'Brien's show. The Conan O'Brien show usually airs at 11:00 PM EST, which is quite late for most children.\n\nTherefore, based on these factors, it's safe to assume that most children would be up past their bedtime if they were watching Conan O'Brien's show. Hence, the answer is (A) yes."

This means that for children living in the Eastern time zone, the show will start at 11 PM which is likely past their bedtime on school nights. \n\nFor children living in the Central, Mountain, or Pacific time zones, the show may start at earlier times depending on their respective time zones. However, since his show airs in the late evening, it is still likely that most children will be up past their bedtime if they are watching the show.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that most children would be up past their bedtime if they were watching Conan O'Brien, making answer (A) the correct choice."

Therefore, the show is likely to air past most children's usual bedtime. \n\nSecond, we need to consider the fact that children are often given a set bedtime by their parents, which is generally earlier than adults' bedtime. Therefore, even if the children are aware of the show and are interested in watching it, they might not be allowed to stay up and watch it because of their bedtime restrictions. \n\nTherefore, based on these two factors, it's safe to assume that most children would be up past their bedtime if they were watching Conan O'Brien, and the correct answer is (A)."
