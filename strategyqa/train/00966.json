Thetan levels are a core concept in Scientology, the practice of which was founded by science-fiction author L. Ron Hubbard. Thetans are considered to be immortal spiritual beings that are distinct from the physical body. Thetan levels refer to different stages of spiritual progression on the path toward enlightenment, with each level representing an increased understanding of the nature of the universe.\n\nNow, turning to the New Testament, it is a collection of writings that make up the second part of the Christian Bible. The New Testament documents the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and the establishment of the early Christian church. The New Testament does not discuss or mention the concept of thetan levels or anything similar to Scientology.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the multiple choice question is (B) no, thetan levels are not found in the New Testament."

Thetan levels are a concept in the Church of Scientology, which believes that humans are made up of immortal spiritual beings called thetans. These thetans supposedly have different levels of awareness or spiritual advancement, which can be improved through Scientology practices and auditing.\n\nNext, we need to examine the New Testament. The New Testament is a collection of texts in the Christian Bible, which documents the life and teachings of Jesus Christ and his early followers.\n\nBased on this information, we can confidently say that thetan levels are not found in the New Testament. The concept of thetans and Scientology practices are not part of Christian theology or traditions, and are not mentioned anywhere in the New Testament texts. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

The New Testament is a collection of 27 books in the Christian Bible, which chronicles the life and teachings of Jesus Christ and the early Christian community.\n\nBased on our understanding of thetan levels and the content of the New Testament, we can conclude that thetan levels are not mentioned in the New Testament. The New Testament does not touch upon Scientology concepts as it predates the establishment of Scientology by thousands of years.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

On the other hand, the New Testament is a collection of books within the Christian Holy Bible that narrates the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.\n\nNow, considering the question, it is highly unlikely that thetan levels could be found in the New Testament. The reason behind this is that the New Testament was written almost two thousand years ago, whereas Scientology is a relatively new religious movement that was founded by L. Ron Hubbard in the mid-20th century. Therefore, it is impossible for the authors of the New Testament to have had any reference or knowledge related to the concept of thetan levels.\n\nFurthermore, the New Testament is mainly focused on the teachings of Jesus Christ, which emphasise principles of love, compassion, and salvation. The doctrine of Scientology, on the other hand, centres around the belief that humans are essentially spiritual beings called thetans, who are bound by negative experiences, known as engrams, from past lives.\n\nTherefore, based on the above analysis, the correct answer to the question is (B) no. There are no thetan levels found in the New Testament."
