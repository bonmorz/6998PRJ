Chordata is a phylum of animals that includes vertebrates and other animals with a dorsal nerve cord and notochord. \n\nNow, we need to check whether any animals mentioned in the Chinese calendar belong to the phylum Chordata. The Chinese calendar is based on a 12-year cycle, with each year named after an animal. These animals are:\n\n1. Rat\n2. Ox\n3. Tiger\n4. Rabbit\n5. Dragon\n6. Snake\n7. Horse\n8. Goat\n9. Monkey\n10. Rooster\n11. Dog\n12. Pig\n\nTo determine whether any of these animals are part of the phylum Chordata, we can research the characteristics of each animal. \n\nRat - Mammal, belongs to phylum Chordata\nOx - Mammal, belongs to phylum Chordata\nTiger - Mammal, belongs to phylum Chordata\nRabbit - Mammal, belongs to phylum Chordata\nDragon - Mythical animal, not applicable\nSnake - Reptile, belongs to phylum Chordata\nHorse - Mammal, belongs to phylum Chordata\nGoat - Mammal, belongs to phylum Chordata\nMonkey - Mammal, belongs to phylum Chordata\nRooster - Bird, belongs to phylum Chordata\nDog - Mammal, belongs to phylum Chordata\nPig - Mammal, belongs to phylum Chordata\n\nAs we can see from this list, the animals mentioned in the Chinese calendar that are included in the phylum Chordata are the Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes."

Chordata is a phylum (a scientific classification of living things) that includes animals with a notochord, which is essentially a long, flexible, and rod-like structure that provides support for their bodies. Examples of animals in this phylum include fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals.\n\nNow, let's look at the Chinese calendar. The Chinese zodiac, which is based on a twelve-year cycle, assigns an animal to each year in the cycle. The twelve animals are: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig.\n\nSo, are any of these animals in the phylum Chordata? Yes, many of them are. For example, rats, oxen, tigers, rabbits, horses, goats, monkeys, roosters, dogs, and pigs are all mammals, which are part of the Chordata phylum. Dragons and snakes, while not necessarily being mammals, are also part of the Chordata phylum as they both have notochords. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

Chordata is a phylum of animals that includes creatures with a notochord (a flexible rod-like structure), which is present in the early stage of development. Examples of Chordata include mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and amphibians.\n\nNow, let's consider the Chinese calendar. The Chinese calendar is based on the 12-year cycle of animals. Each year is represented by an animal from this cycle, in the following order: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that some of the animals in the Chinese calendar are indeed Chordata. For instance, mammals like the Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig are all Chordata. Meanwhile, the Dragon and Snake are not Chordata but grouped into other phyla. \n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (A) yes - there are animals in the Chinese calendar that belong to the Chordata phylum."

The Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar that is based on the lunar cycle and the solar cycle. The calendar is used for traditional purposes in China and other East Asian countries. It is divided into cycles of 12 years, and each year is associated with an animal sign. \n\nNow, we need to look at the animal signs in the Chinese calendar. The animal signs are rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. \n\nTo answer the question, we need to determine if any of these animals are in the phylum Chordata. The answer is yes, because some of the animals in the Chinese calendar are mammals, which are a type of Chordata. Specifically, the animals in the Chinese calendar that are mammals are the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, horse, goat, monkey, and pig. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

These animals are commonly called the Chinese zodiac and include the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. These animals are all species of the animal kingdom, which is divided into several phyla, one of which is Chordata. Chordata is a phylum that includes animals that have a notochord or a dorsal nerve cord. Examples of Chordata include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Therefore, since all of the animals in the Chinese zodiac are species of the animal kingdom, it is safe to say that some of them are members of the Chordata phylum. Thus, the answer to the question is (A)- Yes, some animals in the Chinese calendar are Chordata."

Therefore, our answer is actually (A), since the correct statement would be \"no, there are no animals in the Chinese calendar that belong to Chordata\"."
