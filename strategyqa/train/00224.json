This experiment is relatively easy to replicate, and it does not require any dangerous or hazardous materials. Therefore, a minor can easily replicate the double-slit experiment with adult supervision. All they need is a light source, two small holes, and a screen to observe the interference pattern created by the light waves. Thus, answer (A) is correct: a minor can replicate the double-slit experiment with adult supervision."

It can certainly be replicated by a minor as it does not require any advanced equipment or knowledge.\n\nThe materials required for the experiment are a light source, a piece of paper or cardboard, a ruler, and tape. The minor would need to make two small slits in the paper or cardboard, roughly 0.5 mm wide and 5 mm apart, using a sharp object such as a knife or needle. They would then tape the paper or cardboard onto a flat surface such as a wall or table, and shine a light source such as a flashlight or laser pointer onto the paper or cardboard.\n\nThe minor would then observe the interference pattern that is created on the surface behind the paper or cardboard. The interference pattern will be a series of light and dark bands, caused by the interference of the waves passing through the two slits.\n\nTherefore, a minor can definitely replicate the double-slit experiment with simple materials and equipment."
