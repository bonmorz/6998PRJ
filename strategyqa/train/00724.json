                "content": "First, let's recall the definition of the Fibonacci sequence: the first two numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers. Therefore, the sequence begins 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... and so on.\n\nNow, let's focus on the single-digit numbers. These are the numbers from 0 to 9. We can easily see that the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1) are single-digit numbers.\n\nTo check if there are five different single-digit Fibonacci numbers, we can continue the sequence until we find five distinct single-digit numbers. We can do this by hand or with a calculator, but it's important to check systematically to avoid missing any.\n\nHere are the first few terms of the sequence:\n0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, ...\n\nWe can stop at the 8th term, since the next term (13) is not a single-digit number. So, the five distinct single-digit Fibonacci numbers are:\n0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) yes, there are five different single-digit Fibonacci numbers."

Single-digit numbers are numbers from 0 to 9. We can quickly eliminate numbers 0 and 1 because they are not greater than 1, so they are not the sum of two preceding numbers. \n\nNext, we can check numbers 2 and 3. 2 is the sum of 1 and 1, and 3 is the sum of 2 and 1, so they are Fibonacci numbers. \n\nMoving on, number 4 is not a Fibonacci number, as it is neither the sum of 1 and 1, nor 2 and 1. \n\nNumber 5 is a Fibonacci number, as it is the sum of 3 and 2. \n\nFinally, number 6, 7, 8, and 9 are not Fibonacci numbers since they cannot be obtained by adding two preceding numbers in the sequence. \n\nTherefore, we can confirm that there are exactly five single-digit Fibonacci numbers, which are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5.
