                "content": "First, we need to know the dimensions of a standard football field. According to the National Football League (NFL) rules, a football field has a length of 120 yards and a width of 53.33 yards. \n\nNext, we need to know the approximate size of Alcatraz Island. Alcatraz Island is located in San Francisco Bay and is 22 acres in size. \n\nTo determine whether a football field can fit on Alcatraz Island, we need to convert the size of Alcatraz Island into square feet. One acre is equal to 43,560 square feet, so 22 acres would be 22 x 43,560 = 958,320 square feet. \n\nNow we can determine the area required to fit a football field. Multiplying the length and width of a football field gives us the area of the field which is 120 x 53.33 = 6,400 square yards. Converting this to square feet, we get 6,400 x 9 = 57,600 square feet. \n\nComparing the areas, we can see that 57,600 square feet is smaller than the 958,320 square feet of Alcatraz Island, which means that it is possible to fit a football field on the island. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."
