They typically wear plain, practical clothing made from natural fibers such as cotton, wool, and linen. On the other hand, a Dolce & Gabbana suit is known to be stylish and extravagant, made from high-quality fabrics with intricate details.\nGiven these differences in clothing styles, it is highly likely that an Amish person would view a D&G suit wearer as someone who prioritizes luxury and extravagance over simplicity and modesty. Therefore, it is safe to say that a Dolce & Gabbana suit wearer would be shunned by their Amish cousins. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) yes."
