                "content": "Firstly, what is reiki? Reiki is a form of alternative therapy that involves the use of hands to transfer healing energy.\n\nNow, can somebody leave reiki with bruises? The answer is no. Reiki does not involve any physical manipulation that could cause bruising. In fact, it is a gentle, non-invasive therapy that should leave the recipient feeling relaxed and rejuvenated.\n\nIf somebody does have bruises after a session that they attribute to reiki, it is possible that they may have had an underlying medical condition that was aggravated during the therapy or that the therapist may have applied pressure in an unusual manner. However, these scenarios are rare and not typical of a standard reiki session.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no, somebody would not leave reiki with bruises."

Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a person would leave a reiki session with bruises. Also, reiki practitioners are trained to be gentle and non-invasive during the process. They focus on channeling energy to promote relaxation, healing, and balance in the body. Bruises are usually caused by physical trauma, such as bumping against something or getting hit by an object, and they appear as discolorations of the skin. Since reiki sessions do not involve this type of physical contact or trauma, it is safe to say that bruises are not expected. Hence, the answer is (B) no."

The practice of reiki is generally gentle and non-invasive, and the practitioner does not use any physical force or pressure. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that someone would leave a reiki session with bruises. \n\nBruises are typically caused by some kind of physical trauma or injury, such as a blow, bump, or fall. They occur when the small blood vessels under the skin break, causing blood to leak out and pool, resulting in discoloration and tenderness in the surrounding area. Since reiki does not involve any physical force or contact that could cause such trauma, it is highly unlikely that clients would leave with bruises. In fact, one of the main goals of reiki is to promote healing and reduce pain and discomfort, so bruises would be counterproductive to that aim.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (B) no, it is highly unlikely for someone to leave reiki with bruises."

The practice is based on the belief that a life-force energy flows through every individual and that imbalances in this energy can cause physical or emotional problems. \n\nDuring a Reiki session, the practitioner typically lightly touches or hovers their hands over various parts of the recipient\u2019s body, clearing energy blockages and promoting healing. Because Reiki involves gentle touch and does not involve any forceful or aggressive movements, it is unlikely that someone would leave a Reiki session with bruises. \n\nBruises are caused by damage to blood vessels near the skin's surface, which leads to the pooling of blood and discoloration. This can occur from trauma or forceful impact. Since Reiki is a gentle practice, it is highly unlikely that a recipient would experience any form of trauma or forceful impact. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
