Marco Polo was an Italian merchant and explorer who is famous for his travels to Asia during the 13th century while Columbus was an Italian navigator, colonizer, and explorer who is famous for discovering America in 1492. \n\nNow that we know who they were, we need to see if their timelines overlap. Marco Polo lived between 1254-1324 while Columbus lived between 1451-1506. This means that Marco Polo died over a century before Columbus was even born.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, because Marco Polo and Christopher Columbus did not overlap in terms of the timeline of their travels."

Marco Polo was an Italian merchant, explorer, and writer who traveled to China and Asia in the 13th century. Christopher Columbus, on the other hand, was a Genoese explorer who is best known for discovering the New World in 1492.\n\nNow, let's look at the timeline of their lives. Marco Polo was born in 1254 and died in 1324, over 150 years before Columbus was even born in 1451. This makes it impossible for Marco Polo to have traveled with Columbus since he passed away long before Columbus was even born.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the multiple-choice question is (B) no, Marco Polo did not travel with Christopher Columbus."

Marco Polo was a Venetian merchant and explorer who traveled from Europe to Asia in the 13th century, while Christopher Columbus was an Italian explorer who is best known for his voyages to the Americas in the late 15th century. \n\nNow, let's think about the timeline of their travels. Marco Polo's travels took place in the 13th century, while Columbus's voyages occurred in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. This means that there is a significant time gap between the two explorers. Marco Polo's travels occurred over 100 years before Columbus even set foot on a ship. \n\nBased on these facts, we can conclude that Marco Polo did not travel with Christopher Columbus. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."
