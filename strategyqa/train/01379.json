At this stage, infants have not yet developed the cognitive skills necessary for problem-solving, logic, or reasoning. Sudoku puzzles require a certain level of cognitive abilities, such as concentration, memory, and critical thinking. \n\nTo solve a sudoku puzzle, one needs to identify the correct numbers to fill in the grid based on logic and reasoning, taking into account the rows, columns, and boxes. Infants do not have the ability to process, understand, or communicate such complex information. Therefore, the answer is (B) no, an infant could not solve a sudoku puzzle."

The objective is to fill in the blank spaces with numbers from 1 to 9 in such a way that every row, column, and 3x3 grid contains the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.\n\nNow, let's consider the abilities of an infant. Infants are usually defined as children between the ages of 0 and 12 months. At this stage, their brain development is in the early stages, and they are yet to develop a significant amount of cognitive and problem-solving abilities. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that an infant will be able to solve a Sudoku puzzle.\n\nHence, the correct answer is (B) no."

An infant does not have the cognitive capacity to do that.\n\nSecondly, Sudoku puzzles have a level of difficulty, even the \"easy\" ones. The difficulty level increases as more blank spaces need to be filled in. An infant's brain is not developed enough to solve even the simplest Sudoku puzzle.\n\nLastly, physical ability also comes into play. Infants lack the fine motor skills needed to hold a pencil or a pen and to write numbers in tiny spaces. Therefore, it is safe to say that infants cannot solve Sudoku puzzles."
