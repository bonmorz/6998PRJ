This means that we need to look at the Prime Ministers who came after John Key, and compare the number of women who succeeded him to the number of women who came before him.\n3. Since John Key's term ended in 2016, we need to look at the Prime Ministers who have come after him since then.\n4. There have been two Prime Ministers since John Key: Bill English and Jacinda Ardern.\n5. Bill English served as Prime Minister from 2016 to 2017, and he was succeeded by Jacinda Ardern in 2017.\n6. So we need to compare the number of women who succeeded John Key (i.e. Jacinda Ardern) to the number of women who preceded him.\n7. There were no women who served as Prime Minister before John Key, so the answer is no, more women have not succeeded John Key than preceded him.\n8. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) no."

John Key is a former Prime Minister of New Zealand who served from 2008 to 2016. \n\nNext, we need to determine who succeeded him. After John Key resigned in December 2016, his deputy prime minister, Bill English, became the new Prime Minister of New Zealand. \n\nNow, we need to compare the number of women who succeeded John Key to the number who preceded him. Prior to John Key, the Prime Minister of New Zealand was Helen Clark, who served from 1999 to 2008. Helen Clark was the first female Prime Minister of New Zealand. \n\nTherefore, only one woman, Helen Clark, has preceded John Key as Prime Minister of New Zealand. There have been no women who have succeeded John Key. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) no, more women have not succeeded John Key than preceded him."

After John Key resigned in 2016, he was succeeded by Bill English, another male politician. Since then, the position of Prime Minister has been held by Jacinda Ardern, who is also a woman. However, she did not directly succeed John Key - there was another male Prime Minister in between them. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) no, more women have not succeeded John Key than preceded him as no women have succeeded him in the position of Prime Minister."

There have been two Prime Ministers of New Zealand since John Key's departure in 2016: Bill English and Jacinda Ardern. Since Bill English is a male, we can conclude that the answer to the question is not (A) yes.\n\nFinally, we need to determine whether more women have succeeded John Key than preceded him. To do this, we would need to examine the list of all former Prime Ministers of New Zealand and count the number of women who held the position before and after John Key. However, this information is not directly relevant to the question posed, which only asks whether more women have succeeded John Key than preceded him. Therefore, we can confidently select answer (B) no."
