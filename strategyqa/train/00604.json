This can refer to the geographic region that includes modern-day Israel, Palestine, and parts of Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Next, we need to investigate whether any Islamic empires were in possession of this land during the 16th century. The most likely candidate is the Ottoman Empire, a powerful Islamic empire that controlled much of the Middle East during this time period. After doing some research, we find that the Ottomans did indeed conquer and control the Land of Israel during the 16th century, starting in 1516.
