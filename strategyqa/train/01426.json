The New York Public Library is located in Manhattan, which is around 200 miles away from the Six Flags Great Escape in Queensbury, NY.\n- Next, we need to consider the time it would take to travel between the two locations. By car, it would take around 3.5 hours one way, not taking into account traffic.\n- We also need to consider the operating hours of both locations. The New York Public Library is open from 10 AM to 6 PM, while the Six Flags Great Escape operates from 10:30 AM to 9 PM.\n- Given this information, it is technically possible to visit both locations in the same day, but it would be a very tight schedule. To make the most of the trip, one would need to leave very early in the morning to arrive at the New York Public Library when it opens and then leave soon after to make it to the Six Flags Great Escape in time for its opening.\n- It would then be necessary to leave the theme park early to make the return drive to New York City.\n- While it may be possible to visit both locations in a single day, it would likely be a rushed and exhausting experience."

However, it would be a long day as the travel time between the two locations would be approximately three hours.\n\nTo visit both attractions in the same day, you would need to plan your day carefully. It is recommended to start your day early to allow enough time for traveling and exploring both attractions. You could start your day at the New York Public Library, which opens at 10 am, and spend a few hours exploring the library and its surroundings. Then, you could leave for the Six Flags Great Escape, which opens at 11 am.\n\nAssuming that you arrive at the Six Flags Great Escape by mid-afternoon, you would have a few hours to explore the amusement park and enjoy the rides. The park usually closes at 8 pm, so you would need to make sure you have enough time to enjoy the park before it closes.\n\nIn summary, while visiting the New York Public Library and the Six Flags Great Escape in the same day is feasible, it would require careful planning and an early start to the day."

We can spend a few hours exploring the library and its exhibits. We can leave the library around 1 pm and head to Six Flags Great Escape, which is approximately a 3-hour drive from Manhattan. \n\nIf we arrive by 4 pm, we still have four to five hours at the park, which is ample time to go on several rides, enjoy some snacks and drinks, and take in the park's attractions. We can stay until the park closes at 8 pm and still manage to drive back to Manhattan in time to have dinner.\n\nSo, based on these timings, we can say that it is possible to go to both the New York Public Library and the Six Flags Great Escape in the same day."
