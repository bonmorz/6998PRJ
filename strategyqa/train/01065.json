The Invisible Man is a science fiction novel by H.G. Wells, and it has been adapted into multiple film versions since its publication in 1897. Picnic at Hanging Rock, on the other hand, is a novel by Joan Lindsay that was made into a film in 1975. \n\nBased on this information, we can postulate that The Invisible Man might be more prevalent in films than Picnic at Hanging Rock because it has had a longer history of film adaptations. \n\nTo confirm our answer, we can conduct a quick online search. A search for \"The Invisible Man movies\" reveals a long list of film adaptations, including versions made in 1933, 1940, 1951, and 2020. In contrast, a search for \"Picnic at Hanging Rock movies\" shows only one film adaptation, made in 1975. \n\nThus, based on our research, the answer would be (A) yes, The Invisible Man is more prevalent in films than Picnic at Hanging Rock."

The Invisible Man is a well-known science fiction novel written by H.G. Wells in 1897. It has been adapted into many films and television shows, with the first film adaptation in 1933.
