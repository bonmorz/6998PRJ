                "content": "First of all, it is important to understand who Bruiser Brody is. Bruiser Brody was a professional wrestler who started his career in the 1970s and was known for his rough and tough style inside the ring. He was active in various wrestling promotions including the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) at the time, which is now known as WWE. \n\nNow, coming back to the question, the answer is (B) no. The reason being, Bruiser Brody is not alive today to perform on WWE Raw. He was tragically killed in 1988 while in Puerto Rico for a wrestling event. Therefore, he could not have possibly wrestled on WWE Raw, which started airing in 1993, several years after Brody's death.\n\nIn addition, Bruiser Brody was not well-regarded by the WWF (WWE) management and was only a part of the promotion for a brief period of time. Hence, it is highly unlikely that he wrestled on any WWE Raw episode during his short stint with the company. \n\nIn conclusion, while Bruiser Brody was a prominent figure in professional wrestling during his time, he did not wrestle on WWE Raw due to his untimely death and limited tenure in the WWF (WWE)."
