While some older or more advanced children may ride bicycles without training wheels, many younger children are still learning to ride and may need the added support and stability of training wheels. Therefore, it is likely that children's bicycles often come equipped with training wheels.\n\nFinally, we can look to personal experience or online research to confirm the answer. Many manufacturers specifically market children's bicycles as having training wheels, and a quick Google search for \"children's bicycles\" confirms that they often do come with this extra feature. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, children's bicycles often have extra wheels (in the form of training wheels)."

Extra wheels, also known as training wheels, are small wheels attached to the back of a bicycle to help beginner riders balance and learn how to ride before moving on to a two-wheel bike. \n\nNext, we need to consider the target audience for children's bicycles - kids. Kids are typically new or inexperienced riders, and may require extra support and balance when first learning to ride a bike. Therefore, it is common for children's bicycles to have extra wheels in the form of training wheels.\n\nBased on our understanding of extra wheels and children as beginner riders, the correct answer is (A) yes, children's bicycles often have extra wheels."

Extra wheels are small, stabilizing wheels that are often added to the rear of a bicycle to help young children balance and ride without falling down. \n\nNext, we need to consider whether children's bicycles often come with these extra wheels. The answer is yes, they do. In fact, most children's bicycles that are intended for beginners come with extra wheels as a standard feature. \n\nThe reason for this is that young children are still developing their balance and coordination skills, and may have difficulty keeping their balance on a two-wheeled bicycle. The extra wheels provide added stability and support, allowing children to gain confidence and learn how to ride more easily. \n\nOverall, it is very common for children's bicycles to come with extra wheels, so the correct answer to the question is (A) yes."

Training wheels are small, stabilizing wheels that can be attached to the rear axle of a bicycle to provide additional support and balance for riders who are just learning how to ride. \n\nNext, we need to consider the target audience for children's bicycles. Children's bicycles are designed specifically for younger riders who are still developing their cycling skills. As a result, it is quite common for children's bicycles to come equipped with training wheels. In fact, many children's bicycles are sold with training wheels already attached. These training wheels can usually be removed once the child becomes more comfortable and confident on the bike.\n\nGiven these facts, we can confidently select answer choice (A) - yes. Children's bicycles often do come equipped with extra wheels in the form of training wheels. However, it is important to note that not all children's bicycles have training wheels, and some parents may choose to purchase a bicycle without them in order to encourage their child to learn to ride without assistance."

As a result, children's bicycles often come with extra wheels to provide extra stability and support for young riders who are still learning to balance and control their bikes.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (A) yes. Children's bicycles often come with training wheels, which are small additional wheels that attach to the rear axle of the bike and offer extra support and balance for beginners. These wheels can be easily removed once the child becomes more confident and skilled on the bike.\n\nIt's worth noting that not all children's bicycles come with extra wheels, and some parents may choose to skip training wheels altogether and opt for a regular two-wheeled bicycle with no additional support. However, for most young children who are just starting out, a bike with extra wheels can be a great way to build confidence and learn the basics of riding."

The keyword here is \"often,\" which means the question is asking about the frequency of training wheels on children's bicycles.\n\nBased on common knowledge and observation, it can be suggested that children's bicycles often have extra wheels. This is because most children are not comfortable with balancing on two wheels when they first learn to ride a bicycle, and the additional wheels provide stability and confidence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to this question is (A) yes - children's bicycles often have extra wheels."
