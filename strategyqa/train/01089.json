According to the Chevrolet website, the starting price for a 2020 Corvette is $58,900. \n\nNext, we need to determine the cost of a year at Columbia University. According to the Columbia University website, the estimated cost of attendance for the 2020-2021 academic year is $78,938. This includes tuition, fees, room and board, and other expenses. \n\nNow, we compare the price of the Corvette to the cost of a year at Columbia University. \n\n$58,900 < $78,938 \n\nSince the price of a 2020 Chevrolet Corvette is less than the cost of a year at Columbia University, selling the car could help pay for a year of college. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes."

For the sake of argument, let's assume that the Corvette in question is worth $65,000.\n\nFinally, we just need to compare these two values. Is $65,000 greater than or equal to $61,850? Yes, it is. Therefore, selling a 2020 Corvette for $65,000 would indeed pay for one year of tuition at Columbia University. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) yes."

According to Kelly Blue Book, a brand new 2020 Chevrolet Corvette ranges from around $58,900 to $71,945. \n\nNext, we need to determine the cost of attending Columbia University for one year. According to the Columbia University website, the estimated cost for tuition, fees, and living expenses for undergraduate students for the 2021-2022 academic year is $80,598.\n\nNow, we can compare the two values. If we take the average value of a 2020 Chevrolet Corvette (around $65,000) and subtract it from the cost of attending Columbia University for one year ($80,598), we get a difference of $15,598. So, selling a 2020 Chevrolet Corvette would not completely cover the cost of attending Columbia University for one year.\n\nHowever, the question asks if selling a 2020 Chevrolet Corvette almost pays for a year at Columbia University. To determine whether the difference of $15,598 is a significant portion of the cost of attending Columbia University, we can calculate the percentage that it represents. \n\nTo do this, we divide $15,598 by $80,598 and multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 19.36%. Therefore, the difference of $15,598 represents about 19.36% of the cost of attending Columbia University for one year.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is (A) yes, selling a 2020 Chevrolet Corvette almost pays for a year at Columbia University because the difference of $15,598 represents a significant portion (about 19%) of the cost of attending Columbia University for one year."

However, we can do some calculations just to be sure. \n\nLet's say the value of the Corvette is $70,000. If we subtract this value from the cost of attending Columbia University, we get: \n\n$78,938 - $70,000 = $8,938 \n\nSo, selling a 2020 Chevrolet Corvette for $70,000 wouldn't quite cover the full cost of attending Columbia University for a year.

According to Edmunds, a new car loses up to 20% of its value in the first year, which equates to a value of $47,120 for a 2020 Corvette. \n\nNow, we can compare the value of selling a 2020 Corvette to the cost of attending Columbia University for one year. $47,120 is more than half the cost of attending Columbia University for one year, so yes, selling a 2020 Chevrolet Corvette almost pays for a year at Columbia University. Therefore, the answer is (A)."

If the value of the car is at least $80,000, then selling it could almost pay for a year at Columbia. From our earlier research, we know that the base price of a 2020 Chevrolet Corvette is around $60,000. However, if the car has higher mileage or is in poor condition, it could sell for less than the base price. Therefore, it's possible that selling the car alone may not fully pay for a year at Columbia.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that there may be additional factors to consider, such as financial aid, scholarships, and other forms of assistance that could lower the cost of attending Columbia University. So while selling a Corvette alone may not fully cover the cost of attendance, there are other ways to make attending Columbia more affordable."
