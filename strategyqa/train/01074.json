A deciduous tree is a tree that loses its leaves annually. \nNext, we need to determine if Christmas trees are typically deciduous.

Most Christmas trees are conifers, which are evergreen trees that retain their needles year-round. Examples of popular Christmas tree varieties include spruces, firs, and pines.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that Christmas trees are not typically deciduous, as they do not shed their needles in the fall.
