This endorsement is required by the Department of Transportation (DOT) and is necessary to transport any type of hazardous materials, including aviation fuel.\n\nTo obtain an HME, one must meet several requirements, such as passing a background check, passing a knowledge test on hazardous materials transportation regulations, and passing a driving test in a vehicle carrying hazardous materials.\n\nTherefore, any person with a regular driver's license cannot simply work in the transport of aviation fuel without first obtaining an HME.
