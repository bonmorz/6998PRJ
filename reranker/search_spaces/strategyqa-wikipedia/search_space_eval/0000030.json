Upon telling his mother this, she responded, \"My dear, your father is an engineer. He's a logical, reasonable man with a very clear vision of the world. Do you actually know what it means to be a writer?\" At 17, Coelho's introversion and opposition to following a traditional path led to his parents committing him to a mental institution from which he escaped three times before being released at the age of 20. Born into a Catholic family, his parents were strict about the religion and faith. Coelho later remarked that \"It wasn't that they wanted to hurt me, but they didn't know what to do... They did not do that to destroy me, they did that to save me.\" At his parents' wishes, Coelho enrolled in law school and abandoned his dream of becoming a writer. One year later, he dropped out and lived life as a hippie, traveling through South America, North Africa, Mexico, and Europe and started using drugs in the 1960s. Upon his return to Brazil, Coelho worked as a songwriter, composing lyrics for Elis Regina, Rita Lee, and Brazilian icon Raul Seixas. Composing with Raul led to Coelho being associated with magic and occultism, due to the content of some songs. In 1974, Coelho was arrested for \"subversive\" activities by the ruling military government, who had taken power ten years earlier and viewed his lyrics as left-wing and dangerous. Coelho also worked as an actor, journalist, and theatre director before pursuing his writing career.",

There has been strong evidence that dysprosody does affect the ability to express emotion, however the severity may vary depending on what part of the brain has been damaged. Studies have shown that the ability to express emotional information is dependent on motor, perceptual, and neurobehavioral functions all working together in a specific way. A person suffering from dysprosody would not be able to accurately convey emotion vocally, such as through pitch or melody, or make any conclusion about another person's feeling through his speech. Regardless of the inability to vocally express feeling through prosodic controls, emotions are still formed and felt by the individual.

According to this \"it from bit\" doctrine, all things physical are information-theoretic in origin. In developing the Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP), an , Wheeler used a variant on Twenty Questions, called Negative Twenty Questions, to show how the questions we choose to ask about the universe may dictate the answers we get. In this variant, the respondent does not choose or decide upon any particular or definite object beforehand, but only on a pattern of \"Yes\" or \"No\" answers. This variant requires the respondent to provide a consistent set of answers to successive questions, so that each answer can be viewed as logically compatible with all the previous answers. In this way, successive questions narrow the options until the questioner settles upon a definite object. Wheeler's theory was that, in an analogous manner, consciousness may play some role in bringing the universe into existence.",

We ask ourselves if Thomas, who has recently been betrayed by his girlfriend Ffion, believes that it is possible that the relationship can continue. The way we can find out the answer to this question is simply by asking Thomas if he believes it is possible. Thomas says no. Does this authorize us to attribute to Thomas the belief that the relationship cannot continue? Of course not, since Thomas is probably angry and confuses his desire to break up with Ffion with his beliefs. So we ask him if he is angry with Ffion. He says that he is, but we cannot attribute to him the belief that the relationship \"can\" continue, because we don't really know if he's confusing his desires with his beliefs or vice versa. So now we ask Thomas if he will still retain the same opinion next month. Thomas pauses for a while and then says yes. At this point, we think we have a definitive confirmation of the fact that Thomas believes that the relation must be interrupted, since he reflected on the matter before answering. Just to be sure, we ask him what came to mind during that interval of reflection. Thomas answers that he thought of all the unhappy incidents between that took place between him and Ffion.

            "document": "Kelly Oliver . In \"Earth and World\" (Columbia University Press, 2015), Oliver explores some philosophical reflections on Earth and World, particularly insofar as they relate to the Globe, and thereby to Globalization. She frames the project by analyzing the reactions to the first pictures of Earth from space taken during the Apollo missions of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Examining the rhetoric surrounding these photographs, Oliver identifies a tension between nationalism and cosmopolitanism that sets the tone for this book. In the following chapters, starting with Immanuel Kant, Oliver follows a path of thinking our relations to each other through our relation to the Earth, from Kant's politics based on the fact that we share the limited surface of the earth, through Hannah Arendt and Martin Heidegger's warnings that by leaving the surface of the earth, we endanger not only politics but also our very being as human beings, to Jacques Derrida's last meditations on the singular world of each human being. This trajectory leads us from Kant's universal laws that apply to every human being equally because we share the surface of the earth, through Arendt's insistence on a plurality of worlds constituted through relationships between people, and Heidegger's thoroughly relational account of world, to Derrida's radical claim that each singular human being\u2014perhaps each singular living being\u2014constitutes is not only a world, but also the world. In all of these thinkers, Oliver argues that we find a resistance to world citizenship and globalism. And yet, there, she claims that we also find the resources to think the Earth against the Globe in the hopes of grounding a global ethics on the Earth. The very meaning of Earth and World hang in the balance. So too does our relationship to Earth, World, and to each other. The guiding question that motivates Oliver's book is: How can we share the Earth with those with whom we do not even share a world? The answer to this question, she claims, is crucial in terms of figuring out whether there is any chance for global peace through, rather than against, both cultural diversity and the biodiversity of the planet. She asks: Can we imagine an ethics and politics of the Earth that is not totalizing and homogenizing? Can we develop global ethics and politics that embrace otherness and difference rather than coopting them to take advantage of a global market? How can we avoid the dangers of globalization while continuing to value cosmopolitanism? Her answer is that in various ways, Kant, Arendt, Heidegger and Derrida warn of the dangers of globalism even as they endorse cosmopolitanism. Oliver's book is guided by their discussions of Earth and World and our relations to both, not only to clarify these often ambiguous terms in their work, but also to develop ways of reconceiving both ethics and politics in relation to Earth and World. In the conclusion, Oliver returns to the images of Earth and the contradictory rhetorics of nationalism and cosmopolitanism in order to address the tension head-on, and to further elaborate her Response Ethics.",

Suppose that we have a board set up, the pieces arrayed in a mid-game situation, and we are explaining what a 'knight' is. In doing so, it is highly unlikely that we would use an informational summary approach, which would include telling her such things as that our knights were made of onyx, weighed 2 ounces, were forty years old, and were made in Mexico. Rather, we would provide her with information that has to do with the knight's \"place\" or \"position\" in the total scheme of things. Thus, we would describe what a knight is by informing her of its relationships to the other pieces in the game (e.g., its ability to capture them, to block their movements, to move vis-a-vis them only in a certain distinctive fashion, etc.). Further, looking at any given knight's position relative to other pieces in the game situation displayed, we would help her to understand its current strategic importance. The crucial point here is that our thinking about the knight, indeed our thinking about \"what it is to be a knight\", is quintessentially relational or positional in nature. When we have completed our description, what we have given our child is a summary formulation of the knight's \"status\"\u2014its \"overall place in the scheme of things\"\u2014not an informational summary of many different kinds of facts about knights.\"",

Naively, if we specify a single tag in this system we would uniquely identify lots of documents \u2013 thus the answer to our question is \"not very well!\". However this method carries a faulty assumption; not every document is equal. Some documents are more popular and important than others, and this importance is conveyed by the number bookmarks per document. Thus, we can reformulate the above question to be: how well does the mapping of tags to documents retain about the distribution of the documents? Information theory provides a natural framework to understand the amount of shared information between two random variables. The conditional entropy measures the amount of entropy remaining in one random variable when we know the value of a second random variable. Work done by Chi and Mytkowicz show that the entropy of documents conditional on tags, H(D|T), is increasing rapidly. What this means is that, even after knowing completely the value of a tag, the entropy of the set of documents is increasing over time. Conditional Entropy asks the question: \"Given that I know a set of tags, how much uncertainty regarding the document set that I was referencing with those tags remains?\" The fact that this curve is strictly increasing suggests that the specificity of any given tag is decreasing. That is to say, as a navigation aid, tags are becoming harder and harder to use. We are moving closer and closer to the proverbial \"needle in a haystack\" where any single tag references too many documents to be considered useful.",

As a practical matter it can often be difficult for courts to draw the line between a fact and idea on the one hand and expression on the other hand. Learned Hand is often quoted from his decision in Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., which concerned two plays addressing interracial and inter-religious marriages between Jewish and Irish families, in which he says the following \"We assume that the plaintiff's play is altogether original, even to an extent that in fact it is hard to believe. We assume further that, so far as it has been anticipated by earlier plays of which she knew nothing, that fact is immaterial. Still, as we have already said, her copyright did not cover everything that might be drawn from her play; its content went to some extent into the public domain. We have to decide how much, and while we are as aware as any one that the line, wherever it is drawn, will seem arbitrary, that is no excuse for not drawing it; it is a question such as courts must answer in nearly all cases. Whatever may be the difficulties a priori, we have no question on which side of the line this case falls.\" This quote emphasizes the degree to which courts can have difficulty at the margins in deciding where ideas end and expression begins. For this reason unlike in patent law, the court has to engage in a comparative analysis of the works in question in order to determine whether an infringement is present.",
