In its early going, \"American Dad!\" brought in strong ratings but fought an uphill battle in gaining widespread acceptance and approval from viewers and critics alike. The popularity of MacFarlane and his involvement with \"Family Guy\" have led to foregone conclusions and prejudices against \"American Dad!\" as a rip-off of the predecessor and some critics had already written off \"American Dad!\" prior to its birth as nothing more than a pale imitation of \"Family Guy\" and MacFarlane's attempts to get his old show back on the air. One example, prior to the \"American Dad!\" series debut, a writer of \"The Washington Post\" published a piece that reads \"But those same executives have also given MacFarlane a whole new animated half-hour to play with in the disappointing \"American Dad!\" The new series officially premieres in May but has a sneak preview tomorrow night in the coveted post-Super Bowl time period\u00a0...

This set is about on par with the other seasons and might well be worth a purchase for hardcore fans and completeists. If you think you will like it, you will. If you're on the fence [...] it's probably only a rental.\" R.L. Shaffer of IGN said that \"\"American Dad\" comes from the weird and wicked mind of Seth MacFarlane, who brought us the irreverent and often puerile powerhouse \"Family Guy\" [...], and like the show[s], \"American Dad\" offers a supreme dose of silly mockery that's occasionally offensive [...] and outrageously wacky through-and-through.\" However, he criticized the show for having similar problem that he thought existed in \"Family Guy\". Shaffer opined: \"\"American Dad\" suffers from many of the same problems as \"Family Guy\". The show quite often stumbles into territory it's simply not mature enough to handle. And because the show already plays like \"Family Guy\" 2.0, the characters and settings aren't quite original enough to keep the material fresh.\" He gave the release a 6 out of 10, signifying a \"passable\" score.",

IGN wrote a mixed review stating, \"At its worst, \"American Dad!\" proves critics right \u2013 it is a lot like \"Family Guy\". Stan is an idiot, Roger and Klaus are very similar to Stewie and Brian, and Francine acts as the voice of reason.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but if you're not a fan of \"Family Guy\" you might not be a huge fan of this show, either.\" However, the website believed the series showed improvement towards the end of the season, saying \"once you get into the season, the show becomes downright hilarious, and the humor really detaches from \"Family Guy\".

In some respects, its reliance on horrific violence and awkward humor make it seem more like \"Family Guy\" than \"American Dad\" at its best. A conversation between Steve and an apparently-clean Roger that seems like a reference to a movie just outside of my memory exemplifies this \u2013 it's awkward, but it's a reference, so it's okay? I'm not sure about this episode of \"American Dad\", but I know what I hate, and I didn't hate that.\" Dyanamaria Leifsson of \"TV Equals\" gave the episode a positive review, saying \"I did love Stan\u2019s thunder-butt thunderclap and I thought the ending was pretty cute with Francine calling Stan \"Crater Butt\" and Stan calling her \"Ass Face\" \u2013 thank goodness they\u2019ve got such a great plastic surgeon in town. Although \"American Dad\" normally has a twisted sense of humor, this episode was much darker than I normally expect. If you\u2019re the kind of \"American Dad\" fan that loves when the humor gets really depraved, this episode is bound to be among your favorites. I just hope I\u2019ll be able to forget Francine\u2019s scabby melted face or it will be hard for me to look at her the same way ever again.\"",
