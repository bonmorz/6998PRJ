Upon telling his mother this, she responded, \"My dear, your father is an engineer. He's a logical, reasonable man with a very clear vision of the world. Do you actually know what it means to be a writer?\" At 17, Coelho's introversion and opposition to following a traditional path led to his parents committing him to a mental institution from which he escaped three times before being released at the age of 20. Born into a Catholic family, his parents were strict about the religion and faith. Coelho later remarked that \"It wasn't that they wanted to hurt me, but they didn't know what to do... They did not do that to destroy me, they did that to save me.\" At his parents' wishes, Coelho enrolled in law school and abandoned his dream of becoming a writer. One year later, he dropped out and lived life as a hippie, traveling through South America, North Africa, Mexico, and Europe and started using drugs in the 1960s. Upon his return to Brazil, Coelho worked as a songwriter, composing lyrics for Elis Regina, Rita Lee, and Brazilian icon Raul Seixas. Composing with Raul led to Coelho being associated with magic and occultism, due to the content of some songs. In 1974, Coelho was arrested for \"subversive\" activities by the ruling military government, who had taken power ten years earlier and viewed his lyrics as left-wing and dangerous. Coelho also worked as an actor, journalist, and theatre director before pursuing his writing career.",

There has been strong evidence that dysprosody does affect the ability to express emotion, however the severity may vary depending on what part of the brain has been damaged. Studies have shown that the ability to express emotional information is dependent on motor, perceptual, and neurobehavioral functions all working together in a specific way. A person suffering from dysprosody would not be able to accurately convey emotion vocally, such as through pitch or melody, or make any conclusion about another person's feeling through his speech. Regardless of the inability to vocally express feeling through prosodic controls, emotions are still formed and felt by the individual.

The answer according to Aristotle is that it must involve articulate speech (logos), including both being open to persuasion by reasoning, and thinking things through. Not only will human happiness involve reason, but it will also be an active being-at-work (energeia), not just potential happiness. And it will be over a lifetime, because \"one swallow does not make a spring\". The definition given is therefore: And because happiness is being described as a work or function of humans, we can say that just as we contrast harpists with serious harpists, the person who lives well and beautifully in this actively rational and virtuous way will be a \"serious\" (\"spoudaios\") human.",

As an Appendix to the First Division of Transcendental Logic, Kant intends the \"Amphiboly of the Conceptions of Reflection\" to be a critique of Leibniz's metaphysics and a prelude to Transcendental Dialectic, the Second Division of Transcendental Logic. Kant introduces a whole set of new ideas called \"concepts of reflection\": identity/difference, agreement/opposition, inner/outer and matter/form. According to Kant, the categories do have but these concepts have no synthetic function in experience. These special concepts just help to make comparisons between concepts judging them either different or the same, compatible or incompatible. It is this particular action of making a judgement that Kant calls \"logical reflection.\" As Kant states: \"Through observation and analysis of appearances we penetrate to nature's inner recesses, and no one can say how far this knowledge may in time extend. But with all this knowledge, and even if the whole of nature were revealed to us, we should still never be able to answer those transcendental questions which go beyond nature. The reason of this is that it is not given to us to observe our own mind with any other intuition than that of inner sense; and that it is yet precisely in the mind that the secret of the source of our sensibility is located. The relation of sensibility to an object and what the transcendental ground of this [objective] unity may be, are matters undoubtedly so deeply concealed that we, who after all know even ourselves only through inner sense and therefore as appearance, can never be justified in treating sensibility as being a suitable instrument of investigation for discovering anything save always still other appearances eager as we yet are to explore their non-sensible cause.\" (A278/B334)",

In his indeterminacy of translation theory Quine claims that, if one is to translate a language, there are always several alternative translations, of which none is more correct than the other. A radical translation is therefore impossible. As a special part of this theory the inscrutability of reference indicates that, in trying to find out to which object a certain word (also sentence, sign etc.) of a language refers, there is never only one single possibility. That is even the case, if the possibilities that come into consideration lie very close together. Quine's example of the word \"gavagai\" is used to illustrate this. Note that it is also applied at the indeterminacy of translation, but has traditionally been introduced to point up referential inscrutability. The \"gavagai\" thought experiment tells about a linguist, who tries to find out, what the expression \"gavagai\" means, when uttered by a speaker of a yet unknown, native language upon seeing a rabbit. At first glance, it seems that \"gavagai\" simply translates with \"rabbit\". Now, Quine points out that the background language and its referring devices might fool the linguist here, because he is misled in a sense that he always makes direct comparisons between the foreign language and his own. However, when shouting \"gavagai\", and pointing at a rabbit, the natives could as well refer to something like \"undetached rabbit-parts\", or \"rabbit-tropes\" and it would not make any observable difference. The behavioural data the linguist could collect from the native speaker would be the same in every case, or to reword it, several translation hypotheses could be built on the same sensoric stimuli. Hence, the reference between the term \"gavagai\" and its referring object is language- or framework-dependent, and therefore inscrutable. Quine regards this discovery as trivial, because it is already a widely accepted fact that all the different things one word might refer to can be switched out, because of their proxy functions. Quine does not want to show that those native speakers might speak in interestingly different ways and we cannot know about it, but rather that there is nothing to be known. Not only is it impossible to discern, by any method, the correct translation and referential relation of \"gavagai\", but, in fact, there is not even a correct answer to this question. To make sense of the word \"gavagai\" either way, the linguist simply has to assume that the native speaker does not refer to complicated terms like \"rabbits-tropes\". The finding, then, that \"gavagai\" means \"rabbit\" is not really a translation, but merely a common sense interpretation. It is important to note that indeterminacy and inscrutability not only occur in the course of translating something from a native, unknown language into a familiar one, but among every language. This holds also for languages which are quite similar, like German and Dutch, and even for speakers of the same language. One cannot with certainty say, what exactly his/her conversational partner refers to, when that person is talking about a rabbit. We commonly use the homophonic rule in those cases, i.e., if one utters \"rabbit\", we assume s/he uses it in the same way we do. But, as has been shown, there are multiple possibilities which can be indistinguishable from one another. This also applies in our own case. We ourselves do not know what it is we are referring to in using the word \"rabbit\", that is because there is, in Quine's word, \"no fact of the matter\" at all. One must not, however, use different possible referential objects in the same translation, because they are incommensurable and the resulting translation hypothesis would contain logical fallacies.",

            "document": "Online hate speech . Facebook's terms forbid content that is harmful, threatening or which has potential to stir hatred and incite violence. In its community standards, Facebook elaborates that \"Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that directly attacks people based on their: race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender or gender identity, or serious disabilities or diseases\". It further states that \"We allow humour, satire or social commentary related to these topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, they are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is insensitive, even if that content does not violate our policies. As always, we urge people to be conscious of their audience when sharing this type of content.\" Facebook\u2019s hate speech policies are enforced by 7,500 content reviewers. Because this requires difficult decision making, controversy arises among content reviewers over enforcement of policies. Some users seem to feel as though the enforcement is inconsistent. One apt past example is two separate but similarly graphic postings that wished death to members of a specific religion. Both post were flagged by users and reviewed by Facebook staff. However only one was removed even though they carried almost identical sentiments. In a quote regarding hate speech on the platform, Facebook Vice President of Global Operations, Justin Osofky stated, \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for the mistakes we have made \u2014 they do not reflect the community we want to help build\u2026We must do better.\"  There has been additional controversy due to the specificity of Facebook's hate speech policies. On many occasions there have been reports of status updates and comments that users feel are insensitive and convey hatred. However these posts do not technically breach any Facebook policies because their speech does not attack others based on the company's list of protected classes. For example, the statement \u201cFemale sports reporters need to be hit in the head with hockey pucks,\" would not be considered hate speech on Facebook\u2019s platform and therefore would not be removed. While the company protects against gender based hatred, it does not protect against hatred based on occupation. Facebook also tries to accommodate users who promote other hate speech content with the intent of criticizing it. In these cases, users are required make it clear that their intention is to educate others. If this intention is unclear then Facebook reserves the right to censor the content. When Facebook initially flags content that may contain hate speech, they then designate it to a Tier 1, 2, and 3 scale, based on the content\u2019s severity. Tier 1 is the most severe and Tier 3 is the least. Tier 1 includes anything that conveys \u201cviolent speech or support for death/disease/harm.\u201d Tier 2 is classified as content that slanders another user's image mentally, physically, or morally. Tier 3 includes anything that can potentially exclude or discriminate against others, or that uses slurs about protected groups, but does not necessarily apply to arguments to restrict immigration or criticism of existing immigration policies.",

Some say that Dennett's theory does not satisfactorily deal with the issue of why we feel so strongly that we do have behavioral choice. One answer to this question is the result of selection on individuals to live harmoniously in society. But one doesn't have to be free to achieve that goal. Another answer is that it tells us (our brains) whether we're doing something or someone else is doing something to us (e.g. shaking arm). But, again one does not have to be free to make such a distinction. A final answer to this question is that our sensation of having behavioral choice has been carefully selected by evolution. The well-developed human sensation of having free will and being able to select among possible behaviors has strong survival value. People who lose the feeling that they can plan alternative behaviors and execute their choice of possible behaviors tend to become fatalistic and stop struggling for survival. According to Dennett, belief in free will is a necessary condition for having free will. When we are planning for the future and thinking about possible actions to take in the future, we are utilizing considerable amounts of biologically expensive resources (brain power). Evolution has designed us to feel strongly that all of our effort of planning pays off, that we control what we do. If this connection between our brains' efforts to model reality and predict the future and so make possible good outcomes is disconnected from our sense of self and our will, then fatalism and self-destructive behaviors are close at hand. However, the same effect is attainted if, despite not believing in the control free will gives, we believe that does not prevent us to live as fully as our bodies allow us to and to try harder to achieve things if we think we have agency.",

But if we understand by it an object of a non-sensible intuition, we thereby presuppose a special mode of intuition, namely, the intellectual, which is not that which we possess, and of which we cannot comprehend even the possibility. This would be 'noumenon' in the \"positive\" sense of the term. The positive noumena, if they existed, would be immaterial entities that can only be apprehended by a special, non-sensory faculty: \"intellectual intuition\" (\"nicht sinnliche Anschauung\"). Kant doubts that we have such a faculty, because for him intellectual intuition would mean that thinking of an entity, and its being represented, would be the same. He argues that humans have no way to apprehend positive noumena: Since, however, such a type of intuition, intellectual intuition, forms no part whatsoever of our faculty of knowledge, it follows that the employment of the categories can never extend further than to the objects of experience. Doubtless, indeed, there are intelligible entities corresponding to the sensible entities; there may also be intelligible entities to which our sensible faculty of intuition has no relation whatsoever; but our concepts of understanding, being mere forms of thought for our sensible intuition, could not in the least apply to them. That, therefore, which we entitle 'noumenon' must be understood as being such only in a negative sense. Even if noumena are unknowable, they are still needed as a \"limiting concept\", Kant tells us. Without them, there would be only phenomena, and since potentially we have complete knowledge of our phenomena, we would in a sense know everything. In his own words: Further, the concept of a noumenon is necessary, to prevent sensible intuition from being extended to things in themselves, and thus to limit the objective validity of sensible knowledge.</ref> What our understanding acquires through this concept of a noumenon, is a negative extension; that is to say, understanding is not limited through sensibility; on the contrary, it itself limits sensibility by applying the term noumena to things in themselves (things not regarded as appearances). But in so doing it at the same time sets limits to itself, recognising that it cannot know these noumena through any of the categories, and that it must therefore think them only under the title of an unknown something. Furthermore, for Kant, the existence of a noumenal world limits reason to what he perceives to be its proper bounds, making many questions of traditional metaphysics, such as the existence of God, the soul, and free will unanswerable by reason. Kant derives this from his definition of knowledge as \"the determination of given representations to an object\". As there are no appearances of these entities in the phenomenal, Kant is able to make the claim that they cannot be known to a mind that works upon \"such knowledge that has to do only with appearances\". These questions are ultimately the \"proper object of faith, but not of reason\".",

This was over a keynote speech at a White House Conference on Faith-Based and Community Initiatives in October 2002 where Paige said \"With the stroke of a pen, the President signaled that this Administration will knock down any barrier, will do whatever it takes to get people of faith and goodwill involved in helping solve some of the problems in our society today. Now, President Bush does this because he knows first-hand that power of faith to change lives\u2014from the inside out. And the reason he knows this is because faith changed his life... He grew up in church, but like most of us, he didn\u2019t always walk the walk. Many years ago, at a particularly low point in his life, he realized that something was missing. Fortunately for him, he bumped into the Reverend Billy Graham. And they had a long, long, long conversation. And he made a decision coming out of that conversation that changed his life. And he believes that if it can change his life, it can change the lives of others as well. And that is why he is so committed to this. So the reason we\u2019re all here today is not because some politician needs to knock off one more thing on his \u2018to do\u2019 list. We are here because we have a President, who is true, is a true man of God. A man who prays every day. And I think together, we can really make a difference for mankind, for Americans, we can make America a better place. We can, and I enjoyed the prayer, as we began, served, getting food. He said, if the Jews could be better Jews, and if Christians could be better Christians, if all of us could just be a little better ourselves, what a difference that would make in this world, what a difference that would make.\" The Foundation and its members had held that this \"gave the appearance of endorsing religion.\"",

Rationality, for J\u00fcrgen Habermas (1984), has less to do with knowledge and its acquisition than with the use of knowledge that individuals who are capable of speech and action make. In instrumental rationality, social agents make an instrumental use of knowledge: they propose certain goals and aim to achieve them in an objective world. On the contrary, in communicative rationality, knowledge is the understanding provided by the objective world as well as by the intersubjectivity of the context where action develops. If communicative rationality means understanding, then the conditions that make reaching consensus possible have to be studied. This need brings us to the concepts of arguments and argumentation. While arguments are conclusions that consist of validity claims as well as the reasons by which they can be questioned, argumentation is the kind of speech in which participants give arguments to develop or turn down the validity claims that have become questionable. At this point, Habermas' differentiation between validity claims and power claims is important. We may attempt to have something we say to be considered good or valid by imposing it by means of force, or by being ready to enter a dialogue in which other people's arguments may lead us to rectify our initial stances. In the first case, the interactant holds power claims, while in the second case, validity claims are held. While in power claims, the argument of force is applied; in validity claims, the force of an argument prevails. Validity claims are the basis of dialogic learning.",

Have you noticed how everybody is a moderate these days? Everybody is rushing toward the middle ground. We'll have to revise our terminology now. We'll have to refer to left moderates, right moderates and middle moderates. This type of so-called moderate will be caught up and squeezed in the very middle he has created for himself.\u201d",

            "document": "Direct and indirect realism . A more fundamental criticism is implied in theories of this type. The differences at the sensory and perceptual levels between agents require that some means of ensuring at least a partial correlation can be achieved that allows the updatings involved in communication to take place. The process in an informative statement begins with the parties hypothetically assuming that they are referring to the \"same\" entity or \"property\", even though their selections from their sensory fields cannot match; we can call this mutually imagined projection the \"logical subject\" of the statement. The speaker then produces the logical predicate which effects the proposed updating of the \"referent\". If the statement goes through, the hearer will now have a different percept and concept of the \"referent\"\u2014perhaps even seeing it now as two things and not one. The radical conclusion is that we are premature in conceiving of the external as already sorted into singular \"objects\" in the first place, since we only need to behave \"as if\" they are already logically singular. The diagram at the beginning of this entry would thus be thought of as a false picture of the actual case, since to draw \"an\" object as already selected from the real is only to treat the practically needful, but strictly false, hypothesis of objects-as-logically-singular as ontologically given. The proponents of this view thus argue that there is no need actually \"to believe\" in the singularity of an object since we can manage perfectly well by \"mutually imagining\" that 'it' is singular. A proponent of this theory can thus ask the direct realist feels why he or she thinks it is necessary to move to taking the imagining of singularity for real when there is no practical difference in the outcome in action. Therefore, although there are selections from our sensory fields which for the time being we treat as if they were objects, they are only provisional, open to corrections at any time, and, hence, far from being direct \"representations\" of pre-existing singularities, they retain an experimental character. Virtual constructs or no, they remain, however, selections that are causally linked to the real and can surprise us at any time\u2014which removes any danger of solipsism in this theory. This approach dovetails with the philosophy known as social constructivism.",

            "document": "Kelly Oliver . In \"Earth and World\" (Columbia University Press, 2015), Oliver explores some philosophical reflections on Earth and World, particularly insofar as they relate to the Globe, and thereby to Globalization. She frames the project by analyzing the reactions to the first pictures of Earth from space taken during the Apollo missions of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Examining the rhetoric surrounding these photographs, Oliver identifies a tension between nationalism and cosmopolitanism that sets the tone for this book. In the following chapters, starting with Immanuel Kant, Oliver follows a path of thinking our relations to each other through our relation to the Earth, from Kant's politics based on the fact that we share the limited surface of the earth, through Hannah Arendt and Martin Heidegger's warnings that by leaving the surface of the earth, we endanger not only politics but also our very being as human beings, to Jacques Derrida's last meditations on the singular world of each human being. This trajectory leads us from Kant's universal laws that apply to every human being equally because we share the surface of the earth, through Arendt's insistence on a plurality of worlds constituted through relationships between people, and Heidegger's thoroughly relational account of world, to Derrida's radical claim that each singular human being\u2014perhaps each singular living being\u2014constitutes is not only a world, but also the world. In all of these thinkers, Oliver argues that we find a resistance to world citizenship and globalism. And yet, there, she claims that we also find the resources to think the Earth against the Globe in the hopes of grounding a global ethics on the Earth. The very meaning of Earth and World hang in the balance. So too does our relationship to Earth, World, and to each other. The guiding question that motivates Oliver's book is: How can we share the Earth with those with whom we do not even share a world? The answer to this question, she claims, is crucial in terms of figuring out whether there is any chance for global peace through, rather than against, both cultural diversity and the biodiversity of the planet. She asks: Can we imagine an ethics and politics of the Earth that is not totalizing and homogenizing? Can we develop global ethics and politics that embrace otherness and difference rather than coopting them to take advantage of a global market? How can we avoid the dangers of globalization while continuing to value cosmopolitanism? Her answer is that in various ways, Kant, Arendt, Heidegger and Derrida warn of the dangers of globalism even as they endorse cosmopolitanism. Oliver's book is guided by their discussions of Earth and World and our relations to both, not only to clarify these often ambiguous terms in their work, but also to develop ways of reconceiving both ethics and politics in relation to Earth and World. In the conclusion, Oliver returns to the images of Earth and the contradictory rhetorics of nationalism and cosmopolitanism in order to address the tension head-on, and to further elaborate her Response Ethics.",
