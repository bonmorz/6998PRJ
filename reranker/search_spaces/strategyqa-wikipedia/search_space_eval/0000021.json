In its early going, \"American Dad!\" brought in strong ratings but fought an uphill battle in gaining widespread acceptance and approval from viewers and critics alike. The popularity of MacFarlane and his involvement with \"Family Guy\" have led to foregone conclusions and prejudices against \"American Dad!\" as a rip-off of the predecessor and some critics had already written off \"American Dad!\" prior to its birth as nothing more than a pale imitation of \"Family Guy\" and MacFarlane's attempts to get his old show back on the air. One example, prior to the \"American Dad!\" series debut, a writer of \"The Washington Post\" published a piece that reads \"But those same executives have also given MacFarlane a whole new animated half-hour to play with in the disappointing \"American Dad!\" The new series officially premieres in May but has a sneak preview tomorrow night in the coveted post-Super Bowl time period\u00a0...

This set is about on par with the other seasons and might well be worth a purchase for hardcore fans and completeists. If you think you will like it, you will. If you're on the fence [...] it's probably only a rental.\" R.L. Shaffer of IGN said that \"\"American Dad\" comes from the weird and wicked mind of Seth MacFarlane, who brought us the irreverent and often puerile powerhouse \"Family Guy\" [...], and like the show[s], \"American Dad\" offers a supreme dose of silly mockery that's occasionally offensive [...] and outrageously wacky through-and-through.\" However, he criticized the show for having similar problem that he thought existed in \"Family Guy\". Shaffer opined: \"\"American Dad\" suffers from many of the same problems as \"Family Guy\". The show quite often stumbles into territory it's simply not mature enough to handle. And because the show already plays like \"Family Guy\" 2.0, the characters and settings aren't quite original enough to keep the material fresh.\" He gave the release a 6 out of 10, signifying a \"passable\" score.",

IGN wrote a mixed review stating, \"At its worst, \"American Dad!\" proves critics right \u2013 it is a lot like \"Family Guy\".

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but if you're not a fan of \"Family Guy\" you might not be a huge fan of this show, either.\" However, the website believed the series showed improvement towards the end of the season, saying \"once you get into the season, the show becomes downright hilarious, and the humor really detaches from \"Family Guy\".

I'm not sure about this episode of \"American Dad\", but I know what I hate, and I didn't hate that.\" Dyanamaria Leifsson of \"TV Equals\" gave the episode a positive review, saying \"I did love Stan\u2019s thunder-butt thunderclap and I thought the ending was pretty cute with Francine calling Stan \"Crater Butt\" and Stan calling her \"Ass Face\" \u2013 thank goodness they\u2019ve got such a great plastic surgeon in town. Although \"American Dad\" normally has a twisted sense of humor, this episode was much darker than I normally expect. If you\u2019re the kind of \"American Dad\" fan that loves when the humor gets really depraved, this episode is bound to be among your favorites. I just hope I\u2019ll be able to forget Francine\u2019s scabby melted face or it will be hard for me to look at her the same way ever again.\"",

Large engravings of monumental naturalistic style, or Large-scale Hartebeest style. Beside the great hartebeest, elephants and rhinoceros, Lhote placed the numerous ostriches and antelopes, boars, lions and panthers. The animals are represented absolutely in profile apart from the hartebeest, in relative profile (the two-eyed formula being frequent). Lhote placed in this ensemble the human images which accompany them (of which the hands and feet have almost always six digits). No human figure with animal head having been found, he observed that \"the hartebeest ensembles of the Saharan Atlas differ from those of Tassili-n-Ajjer and of Fezzan where these figures are running. The author also thinks that the domestication of the dog was achieved in this period and that the South Oranian presents the most ancient rock testimonies to it. This first stage also includes the \"mythic animals\". All these engravings are made by a punctuation of little dots or hollows, more or less connected, and then most often by a polishing apparently helped by a wooden utensil with the addition of wet sand. Some engravings show a beginning of polishing in the endoperigraphic area (head), others a complete polishing. 2. Small engravings in naturalistic style, or small-scale hartebeest stage. The stage would be constituted by the collection of engravings of more reduced size, of which the style has been designated as \"School of Tazina\" after the name of one of the sites. These naturalistic images show the same fauna (hartebeest, elephant and rhinoceros) as those of the preceding group but in very conventionalised forms, the legs and tails of the animals being very thinned out, the lines of the horns and the muzzle prolonged in a 'fantastic' way (Flamand), the lengthening of the body, the hind-quarters and the heads having inspired faulty identifications. The style is however not uniform and on certain murals these characteristic deformations co-exist with more realistic depictions. From a technical standpoint the finish of the engravings is regular, no trace surviving of a preliminary dotting-out, and the patina is similar to that of the preceding stage. The human depictions show the same character but the terminal parts of the limbs, hands and feet are generally rounded-off.",

After a very good response, MTV Asia commissioned his company to produce a short film on the back of it. \u201cAs I was creating concepts drawings,\u201d explains Ben Hibon, \u201cMTV Asia was starting to plan their annual Music Awards. They then came up with the idea of \u2018launching\u2019 our project by using it to brand the show; posters, banners, trophy design and intro/bumper animations. So the brief changed from \u2018short film\u2019 to \u2018branding package\u2019 for the MTV Awards show.\u201d It formed into a seven-minute prologue / intro animation to the world of \u2018Codehunters\u2019, an ongoing MTV/BLINKINK project launched around the MTV Asia Awards 2006 in Bangkok.This was obviously a great opportunity for the project to be in front of such a big audience. There was going to be about 400 million people watching the show! There was the challenge of making an animation that would have to work as one film, but also broken into nine scenes to be used throughout the show as a prologue animation, setting the tone, pace and style for a bigger story. Blinkink's Ben Hibon's was contacted with directing and Bart Yates producing an animation for MTV Asia to be show at the MTV Music Awards. Scriptwriting and storyboarding happened simultaneously, as the company had a very short lead time for pre-production. \u201cWe started the production based on the boards, creating concepts and artworks on the way,\u201d Ben explains. \u201cProduction time was tight, so we had to be creative throughout the whole process, both with creation of assets, techniques and solutions. Although the vision of \u2018Codehunters\u2019 was very much defined from the start, the process of making it was very organic, which made it fun and exciting for everyone involved with the project.\u201d European TV was full of cheap programs in the early 80s and Ben Hibon was also a big fan of European graphic-novelists like Bilal, Moebius, Mattoti or Liberatore. \u201cI think that my inspiration lies there\u201d, he begins, \u201cin the middle of two totally different narrative worlds; between the more static illustrative style of the west and the fast-moving stylised techniques of the East. \u2018Codehunters\u2019 is an accumulation of those ideas, where characters and worlds are not so culturally defined; it exists in between those genres and styles.\u2018The main visual ideal for this film was to try to make the CG feel textured and warm, just like an inked illustration on paper,\u2019, says Hibon. \u2018We tried to create a different look by reproducing the ink lines and the hand-drawn feel directly onto the CG models. I also wanted to approach the direction/animation style differently, by applying 2D techniques to CG; not use motion capture or realistic animation, but work with stylised motions, key frames and parallaxes. I think the end result has got a definite feel; a combination of all those ideas.\u201dThe crew were going for a stylised look in the texturing and the rendering, so the use of 3D with a 2D feel created a very original finish. \u201cIt was also important for the sets [the desert and the city] to feel vast and open. Converting to 3D allowed us to create such scale, including camera movements and depth,\u201d explained Hibon. \u201cThe original 2D drawings for the characters were intricate and very detailed, from shapes to textures. We tried to retain those details in the modeling process, for the characters to stay truthful to their original concepts. Those are things that would have been difficult to achieve in 2D, and almost impossible to that level of detail.\u201dThe modeling and the texturing of the characters/elements was the most important and difficult stage in translating the animation. Hibon worked closely with Axis's modeler Sergio Caires, who got the feel for the characters straight away. The texturing/line art style was then meticulously reproduced on each model, matching the original artworks using different drawing/3D packages. \u201cIt was a great process to see 2D concepts become \u2018real\u2019,\u201d \u201cFor the environments, we decided to keep the modeling easy to render, but instead spend a lot of time designing or drawing intricate textures for each specific item, to bring as much detail and richness as possible to the backgrounds and keep that 2D/3D contrast. It was a great process to see the layers of ink, dirt, hand-drawn details and painted textures dress the 3D world and make it come to life.\u201d",

Both reported to Rob Sorcher, who created the idea. It would have worked similar to \"What a Cartoon!\", by creating at least 150 pieces of animation within 20 months. \"Cartoonstitute\" was eventually cancelled, and out of all the shorts, two or three, \"Regular Show\", \"Secret Mountain Fort Awesome\" and \"Uncle Grandpa\", were selected, after animator Craig McCracken (creator of \"The Powerpuff Girls\" and \"Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends\") left the network after 15 years in 2009. On September 20, 2008, Cartoon Network ended Toonami after its 11-year run. From 2008 to 2010, Cartoon Network aired animated shorts that served as interstitials between programs, called \"Wedgies\", which included \"The Talented Mr. Bixby\", \"Nacho Bear\", \"Big Baby\" and \"The Bremen Avenue Experience\". On July 14, 2008, the network took on a refreshed look created by Tristan Eaton and animated by Crew972.

The standard network logo was changed to be white, adopting different colors based on the occasion in the same style.",

Once the expectation that the aspects of visual intrigue or animation being just for children is put aside, the audience can realize that many emotions such as suffering, death, pain, struggle, and joy can all be storytelling elements utilized in anime as much as other types of media. However, as anime itself became increasingly popular, anime styling has been inevitably the subject of both satire and serious creative productions. \"South Park\"s \"Chinpokomon\" and \"Good Times with Weapons\" episodes, Adult Swim's \"Perfect Hair Forever\", and Nickelodeon's \"Kappa Mikey\" are examples of satirical depictions of Japanese culture and anime. Some works have sparked debate for blurring the lines between satire and serious \"anime style\" productions, such as the American anime style production \"\". These anime styled works have become defined as anime-influenced animation, in an attempt to classify all anime styled works of non-Japanese origin. Some creators of these works cite anime as a source of inspiration and like the French production team for \"\u014cban Star-Racers\" moved to Tokyo to collaborate with a Japanese production team. When anime is defined as a \"style\" rather than as a national product it leaves open the possibility of anime being produced in other countries. A U.A.E.-Filipino produced TV series called \"Torkaizer\" is dubbed as the \"Middle East's First Anime Show\", and is currently in production, which is currently looking for funding. The web-based series \"RWBY\" is produced using an anime art style and has been declared to be anime. In addition, the series will be released in Japan, under the label of \"anime\" per the Japanese definition of the term and referenced as an \"American-made anime\". Netflix declared the company's intention to produce anime. In doing so, the company is offering a more accessible channel for distribution to Western markets. Defining anime as style has been contentious amongst fans, with John Oppliger stating, \"The insistence on referring to original American art as Japanese \"anime\" or \"manga\" robs the work of its cultural identity.\"",

The show's digital design department combined high-tech and low-tech methods by creating and photographing three-dimensional objects, then cutting them out and placing them into the background. This made the objects look more real and added perspective and depth. Their animation technique was at that time a new technology. Johnson hired artist Dave Palmer and production company Big Pink to create the animation from simple materials like fabric, paper, or pipe-cleaners, and scan them into a Macintosh computer so that they could be animated using inexpensive computer software such as Media 100, Ultimatte, Photoshop and After Effects, instead of being repeatedly redrawn as in traditional animation. The result was something that looked different from anything else on television at the time, and the producers were able to animate two episodes in eight weeks, as compared to the sixteen weeks necessary to create a single episode by traditional methods. Their process looked like traditional cut-out animation, but was faster, more flexible, and less expensive, and it allowed them to make changes based on feedback from test audiences. Unlike traditional animation environments, which tended to be highly structured, the animators were given information about the characters and goals of the scenes they would animate, and then given the freedom to work out the timing and look of each scene themselves, as long as their creations were true to the characters and to the story. By 1999, the show's animation department consisted of Palmer, 20 animators, 11 digital designers, and 5 art directors and model makers.

He described Patrick as \"probably the dumbest guy in town\".

Hillenburg incorporated character comedy rather than topical humor on the show to emphasize \"things that are more about humorous situations and about characters and their flaws.\" He designed Patrick and SpongeBob as such because \"they're whipping themselves up into situations\u2014that's always where the humor comes from.

The overall fantasy look of the game's world, which mixed natural and technological elements, was also chosen in order to set it apart from classic science-fiction 3D games of the time. This world, as well as dragon and character designs, were mainly the work of Manabu Kusunoki, who took inspiration from various sources, including anime and manga, and who pushed the art direction toward a more Turkish/Ottoman style to avoid the European aesthetics of the early presentation video. Critics have noted similarities with the works of French artist Moebius (notably his comic book \"Arzach\",) of whom Kusunoki was a fan, as well as with Hayao Miyazaki's \"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind\", and David Lynch's \"Dune\" movie. However, Kusunoki was adamant not to include big robots from popular \"Gundam\"-like anime, and unrealistic designs like the spiky and colorful-haired characters wielding impossibly large swords from the \"Final Fantasy\" series. Kentaro Yoshida, texturing and modeling artist, described the creation process as similar in style to \"Star Wars\", in that it \"made an unearthly world appear so real\". Takashi Iwade, in charge of the opening cutscene and character models, designed the enemies using a lot of various influences: \"I got inspiration from antique clocks and various industrial products from the era of the industrial revolution for mechanics, and myriapods, marine mollusks, ammonite, and a rusty fishing boat for creatures when I started thinking of the original battleship\". The team wanted a famous artist to make the game's cover art. Manabu Kusunoki suggested Moebius, who accepted, and the team sent him designs that he was to interpret.

Peter Chan designed backgrounds, spending around two days to progress from concept sketch to final art for each background. Chan too used Looney Tunes as influence for the backgrounds, trying to emulate the style of Jones and Maurice Noble. Ahern and Chan went back and forth with character and background art to make sure both styles worked together without too much distraction. They further had Jones visit their studio during development to provide input into their developing art. The choice of art style inspired further ideas from the designers.

The show's anime-style characters perform with large comedic overuses of face faults, such as a face and/or body turning into an exaggerated general appearance, or becoming much smaller. This allowed animators to have more control over how a character looks and acts than on many other Flash shows, and they did not always have to be on-model.

The animation of characters with large eyes in anime can be traced back to Osamu Tezuka, who was deeply influenced by such early animation characters as Betty Boop, who was drawn with disproportionately large eyes. Tezuka is a central figure in anime and manga history, whose iconic art style and character designs allowed for the entire range of human emotions to be depicted solely through the eyes. The artist adds variable color shading to the eyes and particularly to the cornea to give them greater depth. Generally, a mixture of a light shade, the tone color, and a dark shade is used. Cultural anthropologist Matt Thorn argues that Japanese animators and audiences do not perceive such stylized eyes as inherently more or less foreign. However, not all anime have large eyes.
