It was not until 1916 that Watson would recognize the more general significance of Pavlov's formulation and make it the subject of his presidential address to the American Psychological Association. The article is also notable for its strong defense of the objective scientific status of applied psychology, which at the time was considered to be much inferior to the established structuralist experimental psychology.",

Watson wrote the book \"Psychological Care of Infant and Child\" in 1928, with help from his mistress, turned wife, Rosalie Rayner. Critics then determined that the ideas mainly stemmed from Watson\u2019s beliefs because Rosalie later entitled a self-penned article \"I am a Mother of Behaviorist Sons\". In the book, Watson explained that behaviorists were starting to believe psychological care and analysis was required for infants and children. All of Watson\u2019s exclamations were due to his belief that children should be treated as a young adult. In his book, he warns against the inevitable dangers of a mother providing too much love and affection. Watson explains that love, along with everything else as the behaviorist saw the world, is conditioned. Watson supports his warnings by mentioning invalidism, saying that society does not overly comfort children as they become young adults in the real world, so parents should not set up these unrealistic expectations. Writer Suzanne Houk, \"Psychological Care of Infant and Child: A Reflection of its Author and his Times\", critiques Watson\u2019s views, analyzing his hope for a businesslike and casual relationship between a mother and her child. Watson disapproved of thumb sucking, masturbation, homosexuality, and encouraged parents to be honest with their children about sex. Watson's reasoning for this was that, \"all of the weaknesses, reserves, fears, cautions, and inferiorities of our parents are stamped into us with sledge hammer blows\".

Although Watson applied for a patent for flying machines in late 1907 however, had an aircraft been built that incorporated his ideas, with all the will in the world it never would have left the ground. This is another fact that flies in the face of a Watson built flying machine of any sort in 1903. Why would he produce such na\u00efve work if his prior research into methods of achieving flight had been successful? Another cause for debate is the claim that Preston Watson approached celebrated Brazilian aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont in 1906 and purchased from him a Dutheil Chalmers engine. In 1955, John Bell Milne made a personal assertion to Charles Gibbs-Smith that the year the motor was purchased was 1906. This could not have been possible, since Dutheil Chalmers & Cie did not construct their first aero-engine until 1907. In a later interview Bell Milne changed the date to a year later, thus bringing into question his earlier statements\u2019 validity. Photographs show a Dutheil Chalmers motor fitted to Watson's first rocking wing aircraft, but Gibbs-Smith later presented these to M. Charles Dolfuss, Director of the Musee de L'Air at Le Bourget, Paris who confirmed it as a 1908 or 1909 four cylinder 40\u00a0hp Dutheil Chalmers motor. If Watson acquired the Dutheil Chalmers engine from Santos-Dumont, the earliest date the purchase could have taken place was 1908. A further false statement made by James Watson was that Preston had the No. 3 shipped to France and entered into a competition, in which it won a safety award. No evidence of this can be found anywhere. The only competition in France Preston entered any of his aeroplanes in was the Concours de La S\u00e9curit\u00e9 en A\u00e9roplanes, in which his No.3 aeroplane was disqualified. Some sources quote the date in which Watson's No.3 won the safety prize was 1913, but the Concours held between 1 January and 1 July 1914 was the first of its kind.",

Owing to himself claiming that Preston had flown an unpowered aircraft that year in \"Aeronautics\" magazine two years earlier and in the later letter to Gibbs-Smith, one wonders whether James was aware of the discrepancies in his own testimonies, as one by one his claims were disproved.

Watson's new aeroplane was powered by a 1910 three cylinder 30\u00a0hp Humber engine. A number of accounts state that Preston, his younger brother James and Archie Dickie, who had allegedly gone to Paris to secure a Dutheil Chalmers engine from Alberto Santos-Dumont for Watson's previous aeroplane, all flew the machine at Errol at this time. The pictures published in the 15 May 1914 issue of Flight magazine, which captions the images as having been taken in 1912 have been mis-quoted by James as having been taken in 1908, but the No.2 was built in 1910 and it's 30\u00a0hp Humber engine was not produced until that year. On being given this piece of rather pointed evidence to the contrary by prominent aviation author Charles Gibbs-Smith, James Watson promptly changed his story. As with his first aeroplane, it is safe to assume that Watson's primary concern about the No.2 would have been its powerplant; above all other considerations, he had to equip it with an engine that was able to get it into the air. Quite probably, his choice of engine was driven by cost and availability. As with his first aeroplane, the fate of the Watson No.2 is unknown, although it was probably scrapped with the outbreak of the Great War. Watson's Third Aeroplane",

Preston Watson's achievements, although not spectacular are today regarded with scepticism because of the erroneous claims of powered-flight-before-the-Wrights in the summer of 1903 that originated from his younger brother James. According to Alistair W. Blair and Alistair Smith in The pioneer flying achievements of Preston Watson, James Watson began collating information on the claim in a letter to the Science Museum, London dated 21 October 1949. In the 15 December 1953 issue of the Manchester Guardian newspaper, James had an article published referencing the claim, although it wasn't the first public acknowledgement of it. Following this, James Watson approached the Royal Aeronautical Society via a joint dinner with the Royal Aero Club at the Dorchester Hotel, London, commemorating 50 years since the Wright Brothers' first powered flight on 17 December 1903, with evidence, including photographs and eye-witness accounts that Preston Watson flew a powered aeroplane before the Wright Brothers. A further article appeared in the February 1954 issue of Aeronautics magazine titled The Watson History, in which James Watson re-iterated his claim, although the magazine's editor cautiously advised readers that; \"we would say that we are not convinced that Preston Watson can upset existing priority claims for controlled and sustained flight\". Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum and professional aviation researcher Charles Gibbs-Smith vigorously investigated the Watson claim. The presentation of Gibbs-Smith's findings to him eventually forced a change of tack from Watson the Younger. Published in the December 1955 issue of Aeronautics magazine titled A pioneer in Scotland, James changed his story from that published in the same magazine previously, stating that \"Preston's first aeroplane was without an engine\" and that \"trial flights were made at Errol in the summer of 1903\". In a letter to Gibbs-Smith, James also wrote, \"I make no claim that the 'machine' Preston used at Errol in 1903 was a powered machine.\"",

Watson accused White of a \"lack of integrity\", as White had \"attacked Schalk Brits\" for wanting to play professionally in England, yet he himself had \"tried to hold SA Rugby to ransom with an overseas offer\". Watson also questioned the credentials of captain John Smit and he said there was no longer any pride and passion in the Springbok squad. Watson reportedly said: \"Obviously I would love to play for the Springboks, but I do not want to find myself in a position where I'm compromising my beliefs in equality, integrity and honour to achieve that goal.\" Watson\u2019s comments in the 2006 \"SA Sports Illustrated\" interview revealed his own negative feeling at the time towards White, captain John Smit and the squad. When Watson was finally selected as a Springbok in 2007 and was asked in media interviews to comment on his earlier public criticisms, he maintained that he stood by what he had said a year earlier.",

Nowadays, the efforts of the competitors and judges at the Concours are all-but forgotten, but many of the features pioneered at the event were to resurface on modern aircraft. For Preston Watson, the event proved less than successful, but it illustrated his dedication to his work. One positive consequence of his entry was that his theories became known to a wider audience after the article in Flight magazine that year, where he went into detail about his rocking wing method of control. With the declaration of war in August 1914, Watson hoped to volunteer for service with the Royal Flying Corps - he had held a commission as a volunteer with the Royal Forfarshire Yeomanry, but was refused, being described as too old to fly. In a letter to his wife Beatrice, written presumably in the later months of 1914, published in Alistair W. Blair and Alistair Smith's book \"The pioneer flying achievements of Preston Watson\", Preston explains a meeting with Lithuanian born Leo Anatole Jouques, employed by the War Office to manufacture aeroplanes under licence by his firm Jouques Aviation Works at Willesden and apparently well connected, who suggested to him he might be able to assist him with a commission with the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough. Interestingly, according to letters written by Watson and published in the aforementioned book, he showed Jouques photographs and written details of his rocking wing experiments and aeroplanes, who seemed genuinely interested in the design and claimed he would organise for Watson to give a public demonstration of the machine to the War Office. Evidently this did not take place and Watson was also less-than-enthused by an offer by Jouques to manufacture (presumably) the No.3. Jouques returned to Watson claiming that his wife, who had access to Lord Kitchener and was requesting of him that he gain Watson a commission and that modifications to its undercarriage be made at Jouques' expense before Watson demonstrate the machine to the War Office. Nothing came of any of this, again, presumably because of Watson's own reluctance, as he states in one of the letters that he is \"swithering\" over the latest offer by Jouques. One of these letters hints at Watson's own displeasure with his aircraft, although exactly what this might be in regards to is unknown. Was he displeased with his machine's performance at the Concours de La S\u00e9curit\u00e9 en A\u00e9roplanes competition, or was it at the lack of progress with and/or recognition of his experiments as a whole?",

For any claimant to powered flight earlier than the Wrights, the date of the Wright's first powered flight (17 December 1903) is when such flights must pre-date. It is therefore convenient for anyone recalling such an event some fifty years after it allegedly took place to quote the year as 1903 or earlier. It is also notable that none of the eye witnesses that James Watson interviewed whilst preparing his case for Watson's powered flights ever mentioned that they saw a glider flying at Errol; all of them saw a powered aeroplane. Only in Bell Milne was there a recollection of a Watson glider and even then, he never saw it being flown. Debated Claims",

            "document": "Dr. Watson . Watson sometimes attempts to solve crimes on his own, using Holmes's methods. For example, in \"The Hound of the Baskervilles,\" Watson efficiently clears up several of the many mysteries confronting the pair, and Holmes praises him for his zeal and intelligence. However, because he is not endowed with Holmes's almost-superhuman ability to focus on the essential details of the case and Holmes's extraordinary range of recondite, specialised knowledge, Watson meets with limited success in other cases. Holmes summed up the problem that Watson confronted in one memorable rebuke from \"A Scandal in Bohemia\": \"Quite so... you see, but you do not observe.\" In \"The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist,\" Watson's attempts to assist Holmes's investigation prove unsuccessful because of his unimaginative approach, for example, asking a London estate agent who lives in a particular country residence. (According to Holmes, what he should have done was \"gone to the nearest public house\" and listened to the gossip.) Watson is too guileless to be a proper detective. And yet, as Holmes acknowledges, Watson has unexpected depths about him; for example, he has a definite strain of \"pawky humour\", as Holmes observes in \"The Valley of Fear\". Watson never masters Holmes's deductive methods, but he can be astute enough to follow his friend's reasoning after the fact. In \"The Adventure of the Norwood Builder,\" Holmes notes that John Hector McFarlane is \"a bachelor, a solicitor, a Freemason, and an asthmatic\". Watson comments as narrator: \"Familiar as I was with my friend's methods, it was not difficult for me to follow his deductions, and to observe the untidiness of attire, the sheaf of legal papers, the watch-charm, and the breathing which had prompted them.\" Similar episodes occur in \"The Adventure of the Devil's Foot,\" \"The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist,\" and \"The Adventure of the Resident Patient.\" In \"The Adventure of the Red Circle\", we find a rare instance in which Watson rather than Holmes correctly deduces a fact of value. In \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\", Watson shows that he has picked up some of Holmes's skills at dealing with people from whom information is desired. (As he observes to the reader, \"I have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing.\" )",

Watson says when a baby first cries, or first says \"da\" or \"ma,\" that it is learning language. Watson also used an experiment that he and his wife conducted, in which they conditioned a baby to say \"da-da\" when he wanted his bottle. Although the baby was conditioned and was a success for a short while, the conditioning was eventually lost. Watson does say, however, that as the child got older, he would imitate Watson as a result of Watson imitating him.

Watson thinks the root of that inflammation is different: \"a lack of biological oxidants, not an excess\", and discusses this in detail. One critical response was that the idea was neither new nor worthy of merit, and that \"The Lancet\" published Watson's paper only because of his name.
