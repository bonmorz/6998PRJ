Although the film was highly publicized as Crawford's major comeback, it was ultimately a critical and financial failure, known today for its camp appeal. In 1954, she starred in the cult camp western film classic \"Johnny Guitar\", co-starring Sterling Hayden and Mercedes McCambridge. She also starred in \"Female on the Beach\" (1955) with Jeff Chandler, and in \"Queen Bee\" (1955) alongside John Ireland. The following year, she starred opposite a young Cliff Robertson in \"Autumn Leaves\" (1956), and filmed a leading role in \"The Story of Esther Costello\" (1957), co-starring Rossano Brazzi. Crawford, who had been left near-penniless following Alfred Steele's death, accepted a small role in \"The Best of Everything\" (1959). Although she was not the star of the film, she received positive reviews. Crawford would later name the role as being one of her personal favorites. However, by the early 1960s, Crawford's status in motion pictures had declined considerably. Crawford starred as Blanche Hudson, an elderly, disabled former A-list movie star who lives in fear of her psychotic sister Jane, in the highly successful psychological thriller \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\" (1962). Despite the actresses' earlier tensions, Crawford reportedly suggested Bette Davis for the role of Jane. The two stars maintained publicly that there was no feud between them. The director, Robert Aldrich, explained that Davis and Crawford were each aware of how important the film was to their respective careers, and commented, \"It's proper to say that they really detested each other, but they behaved absolutely perfectly.\"",

Garland's daughter Liza Minnelli would later follow in her mother's footsteps as a gay icon, as would fellow musical artist Barbra Streisand.
