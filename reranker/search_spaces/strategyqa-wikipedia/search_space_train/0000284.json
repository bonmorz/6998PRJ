As thirteen years had passed since the last 2D \"Metroid\" game\u20142004's \"\"\u2014was released, Sakamoto had a desire to create a new game in this style. He was also aware of the growing demand from fans for a new 2D \"Metroid\" game. Sakamoto had heard that MercurySteam were interested in taking on the challenge of remaking a \"Metroid\" game, so he visited their studio to organise a collaboration. Although Sakamoto did not work on \"Metroid II\", he believed it to be an important game within the series and so he was enthusiastic about remaking the title. Enric \u00c1lvarez, the head of MercurySteam, described their collaboration with Nintendo as an \"incredible\" achievement for the developer. The development on \"Samus Returns\" began in 2015. Sakamoto noted that the potential for 2D games in the \"Metroid\" franchise had opened up for Nintendo following the announcement of the game. He expressed that he was keen to evolve some of the traditions in 2D \"Metroid\" games. As a remake, he wanted to preserve some of the originality and wanted to avoid changing things without good reason. Their approach was to add to aspects which improved upon the game's core concept. These ideas led to some control enhancements, such as the addition of free aiming for more precise firing. The idea of a melee counterattack came from MercurySteam, who had implemented a similar parry mechanic in their 2013 game, \"\". Sakamoto felt that the inclusion of the melee counterattack offered players an alternative combat style, in contrast to previous games where the player had to rely on dodging charge attacks from enemies and then defeating them from afar. The decision to transition from the 2D pixel art of previous \"Metroid\" titles to 3D polygonal graphics was made so that the development team could incorporate a lot of varied animation and use different angles to enhance the cutscenes. The music was composed by Daisuke Matsuoka and directed by Kenji Yamamoto, with the latter previously co-composing the music for the 1994 Super Nintendo Entertainment System game \"Super Metroid\".",

Sakamoto noted that the potential for 2D games in the \"Metroid\" franchise had opened up for Nintendo following the announcement of the game. He expressed that he was keen to evolve some of the traditions in 2D \"Metroid\" games. As a remake, he wanted to preserve some of the originality and wanted to avoid changing things without good reason. Their approach was to add to aspects which improved upon the game's core concept.

The idea of a melee counterattack came from MercurySteam, who had implemented a similar parry mechanic in their 2013 game, \"\".

While developing the game, most of NST's efforts were focused on its multiplayer aspect because of its first-person shooter gameplay, and to take advantage of the Wi-Fi and voice chat capabilities of the Nintendo DS. One of the game's designers, Richard Vorodi, noted that \"the hardware kinda dictated [their focus onto the game's multiplayer mode].\" Wanting to introduce a new element to the \"Metroid\" series, Abe created several new bounty hunters after he realized that the game's multiplayer mode and the new bounty hunters could both be implemented seamlessly into the game: \"We had this idea early on and thought that would be a good way to introduce [\"Metroid Prime Hunters\"] and [the new bounty hunters] to the gameplay and take advantage of that in the multiplayer.\" \"Metroid Prime Hunters\" includes several references to previous games in the \"Metroid Prime\" series. Samus' ship is from the original \"Metroid Prime\", and her suit is the same one that appears in \"Metroid Prime 2: Echoes\". The developers decided to add them because they wanted to show that the technology has evolved, and they also wanted to include something that was instantly recognizable to those who had played previous games in the series. On level design, Abe said that as the game's controls shifted from an analog stick method to touchscreen aiming, the developers wanted to avoid making the gameplay and the control scheme more difficult.",

On Top 100 Games lists, the game was ranked 69th by \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", and 6th by \"Game Informer\" then 7th in 2009 by \"Game Informer\". \"Game Informer\" also put \"Metroid\" 7th on their list of \"The Top 200 Games of All Time\", saying that it \"started the concept of open exploration in games\". GamesRadar ranked it the fifth best NES game ever made.

The website felt that the combination of detailed sprites, original map designs, and an intimidating musical score \"generated an unparalleled ambience and atmosphere that trapped the viewer in an almost claustrophobic state\". They also noted that the Morph Ball, first introduced in \"Metroid\", \"slammed an undeniable stamp of coolness on the whole experience and the franchise\", and they enjoyed the end segment after defeating Mother Brain, claiming that the race to escape the planet Zebes was a \"twist few saw coming\". The game brought \"explosive action\" to the Nintendo Entertainment System and a newfound respect for female protagonists. Noting that \"Metroid\" was not the first game to offer an open world, nor was it the first side-view platformer exploration game, and neither was it the first game to allow players to reach new areas using newly acquired items, Gamasutra praised \"Metroid\" for being perhaps the first video game to \"take these different elements and rigorously mold them into a game-ruling structure\".",
