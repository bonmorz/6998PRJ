It is extremely easy for people to use the Internet in negative ways such as finding potential victims for sexual crimes.

The Internet can also be used as a tool to lure potential victims. It is important to be aware that different typologies of online offenders do exist. Online offenders are commonly characterized as those individuals who (1) access child pornography due to impulse without any specific sexual interest in children; (2) access child pornography to satisfy sexual fantasies but do not commit contact sex offenses; (3) make and handout child pornography just for financial gain and benefit; and (4) use the Internet to facilitate contact sex offenses.",

After this interview, Gore became the subject of controversy and ridicule when his statement \"I took the initiative in creating the Internet\" was widely quoted out of context. It was often misquoted by comedians and figures in American popular media who framed this statement as a claim that Gore believed he had personally \"invented\" the Internet. Gore's actual words, however, were widely reaffirmed by notable Internet pioneers, such as Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, who stated, \"No one in public life has been more intellectually engaged in helping to create the climate for a thriving Internet than the Vice President.\" Former UCLA professor of information studies, Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in \"Wired News\" led to the creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have \"invented the Internet,\" which followed this interview. Jim Wilkinson, who at the time was working as congressman Dick Armey's spokesman, also helped sell the idea that Gore claimed to have \"invented the internet.\" Computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued against this characterization. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that \"we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet.\" Cerf would also later state: \"Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit.\"  In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: \"In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is -- and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got [to Congress], we were both part of a \"futures group\"\u2014the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen.\" Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: \"I didn't ask him about the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative in creating the Internet to\u2014I invented the Internet.

Elseth argues that if the parent did give the gun to the child then the parent would be responsible for that crime. However, if God was unsure about the outcome then God would not be culpable for that act; only the one who committed the act would be guilty. This position is, however, dubious, as a parent who knows his child was probable, or likely, or even possibly going to shoot someone would be culpable; and God knew that it was likely that man would sin, and thus God is still culpable. An orthodox Christian might try, on the contrary, seek to ground a Theodicy in the Resurrection, both of Christ and the general Resurrection to come, though this is not the traditional answer to evil. Another position put forth by Orthodox Christians is to point out that God is the ultimate law giver and thus there exists no objective standard of good or evil above God regulating God. Therefore, the so-called problem of evil, which presupposes such an independent standard, is not an objection that a Bible believing Christian has to respond to.

It's probably because you were born that way.\" He carried this view through into his writing, describing the approach as \"making the thing a sort of musical comedy without music, and ignoring real life altogether\". The literary critic Edward L. Galligan considers Wodehouse's stories to show his mastery in adapting the form of the American musical comedy for his writings. Wodehouse would ensure that his first draft was as carefully and accurately done as possible, correcting and refining the prose as he wrote, and would then make another good copy, before proof reading again and then making a final copy for his publisher. Most of Wodehouse's canon is set in an undated period around the 1920s and 1930s. The critic Anthony Lejeune describes the settings of Wodehouse's novels, such as the Drones Club and Blandings Castle, as \"a fairyland\". Although some critics thought Wodehouse's fiction was based on a world that had never existed, Wodehouse affirmed that \"it did. It was going strong between the wars\", although he agreed that his version was to some extent \"a sort of artificial world of my own creation\". The novels showed a largely unchanging world, regardless of when they were written, and only rarely\u2014and mistakenly in McCrum's view\u2014did Wodehouse allow modernity to intrude, as he did in the 1966 story \"Bingo Bans the Bomb\".",

The Spekkens toy model is based on the knowledge balance principle: \"the number of questions about the physical state of a system that are answered must always be equal to the number that are unanswered in a state of maximal knowledge.\" However, the \"knowledge\" one can possess about a system must be carefully defined for this principle to have any meaning. To do this, the concept of a \"canonical\" set of yes or no questions is defined as the minimum number of questions needed. For example, for a system with 4 states, one can ask \"Is the system in state 1?\", \"Is the system in state 2?\" and \"Is the system in state 3?\" which would determine the state of the system (state 4 being the case if all three questions were answered \"No.\"). However, one could also ask \"Is the system in either state 1 or state 2?\" and \"Is the system in either state 1 or state 3?\", which would also uniquely determine the state, and has only two questions in the set. This set of questions is not unique, however it is clear that at least two questions (bits) are required to exactly represent one of four states. We say that for a system with 4 states, the number of questions in a canonical set is two. As such, in this case, the knowledge balance principle insists that the maximum number of questions in a canonical set that one can have answered at any given time is one, such that the amount of knowledge is equal to the amount of ignorance.",
