The newly relocated Washington Senators club was included in the new roster of franchises in the A.L. as it embarked on a two-year baseball war with the Nationals. By 1903, peace was restored with agreements between the two rival baseball loops on player contract and represented member cities/teams, and the beginnings of a national championship series entitled the World Series. In 1905, the team changed its official name to the Washington Nationals. The name \"Nationals\" would appear on the uniforms for only 2 seasons, and would then be replaced with the \"W\" logo for the next 52 years. The media often shortened the nickname to \"Nats\". Many fans and newspapers (especially out-of-town papers) persisted in continuing using the previous \"Senators\" nickname. Over time, \"Nationals\" faded as a nickname, and \"Senators\" became dominant. Baseball guides would list the club's nickname as \"Nationals or Senators\", acknowledging the dual-nickname situation. After 61 years in the capital, in 1961, the Senators relocated to the upper Midwest to Minnesota and were renamed as the Twins, being the first major league baseball team to use a state in its name rather than the traditional city.",
