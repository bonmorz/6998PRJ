His neighborhood had no traffic signals, there was no electricity in many of the homes, and there was a single gas station. He moved to Danbury, Connecticut in 1999 to help support his family and quickly found a job in landscaping. It was there that he met his wife, Ingrid. After watching boxers such as Mike Tyson and the early mixed martial arts fighters such as Royce Gracie and Chuck Liddell compete, Teixeira decided that he wanted to follow the same path. He had never heard of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, but was able to find and watch videos of UFC 1 and UFC 2 which featured the legendary UFC Hall of Famer Royce Gracie. After working 10- to 12-hour days landscaping, Teixeira would then go train Boxing at Hat City Boxing and Brazilian jiu-jitsu at American Top Team Connecticut. John Hackleman had trained a fighter who fought Teixeira and was impressed by the young Brazilian. Hackleman invited Teixeira to his gym in California, The Pit, where Teixeira began training with UFC Hall of Famer Chuck Liddell.",

Bravo's system emphasizes developing students for submission-only grappling competition rather than points. He focused his jiu-jitsu training without the traditional gi; becoming one of the first jiu-jitsu schools to do so. The idea behind this was to try to implement as many of the techniques as possible in mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions. Bravo worked for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) during this time and felt high-level jiu-jitsu practitioners weren't winning as much they should have, mainly attributing this to them wearing a gi when training jiu-jitsu but competing in MMA without one. 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu has been controversial since it's inception. Bravo's changes to traditional Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, like abandoning the gi, drew a lot of backlash and there has been debate to how much 10th Planet techniques, most notably its iterations of the rubber guard, translates to MMA.",

The locking mechanism is similar to the kimura lock, but instead of using a figure-four, it is applied using a leg. The omoplata can be applied from the guard, by placing one leg under the opponent's armpit and turning 180 degrees in the direction of that leg, so that the leg moves over the back of the opponent and entangles the opponent's arm. By controlling the opponent's body and pushing the arm perpendicularly away from the opponent's back, pressure can be put on the opponent's shoulder. It is also possible to put pressure on the elbow joint by bending the leg entangling the arm, and twisting it in a specific manner. In order to secure the opponent and prevent him from rolling out of the lock, the inner arm can be thrown over the opponent's waist as a \"seatbelt\" securing the opponent. Though an effective lock, it is more difficult than other armlocks to successfully apply. The technique called a monoplata is a similar armlock that resembles j\u016bji-gatame or spiderweb position yet has a mechanism like an omoplata.",

The English word \"bar\" is used here to signify the opponent's extended arm, while the Japanese word \"j\u016bji\" (\u5341\u5b57) refers to the armbar's visual resemblance to the number 10 as written in kanji, \u5341. The word j\u016bji is also found in \"j\u016bjika\" (\u5341\u5b57\u67b6), meaning a cross. In general, the practitioner secures an arm at the wrist of the opponent, trapping it by squeezing the knees together. To initiate the submission one of the legs will be across the chest of the opponent, the second leg's calf will cross face the opponent, with the hips tight into the armpit, with the arm held between the thighs, with the elbow pointing against the thigh or hips. By holding the opponent's wrist to the attacker's chest with the pinky finger on the sternum and the thumb facing up (arm semi-supinated or semi-pronated), the practitioner can easily extend the opponent's arm and hyperextend the opponent's elbow. The attacker can further increase the pressure on the elbow joint by arching his hips against the elbow.
