Wodehouse's early period as a writer came to an end in 1908 with the serialisation of \"The Lost Lambs\", published the following year in book form as the second half of the novel \"Mike\". The work begins as a conventional school story, but Wodehouse introduces a new and strikingly original character, Psmith, whose creation both Evelyn Waugh and George Orwell regarded as a watershed in Wodehouse's development. Wodehouse said that he based Psmith on the hotelier and impresario Rupert D'Oyly Carte\u2014\"the only thing in my literary career which was handed to me on a silver plate with watercress around it\". Wodehouse wrote in the 1970s that a cousin of his who had been at school with Carte told him of the latter's monocle, studied suavity, and stateliness of speech, all of which Wodehouse adopted for his new character. Psmith featured in three more novels: \"Psmith in the City\" (1910), a burlesque of banking; \"Psmith, Journalist\" (1915) set in New York; and \"Leave It to Psmith\" (1923), set at Blandings Castle.",

Some come through exaggeration, such as Bingo Little's infant child who \"not only has the aspect of a mass murderer, but that of a mass murderer suffering from an ingrown toenail\", or Wooster's complaint that \"the rumpuses that Bobbie Wickham is already starting may be amusing to her, but not to the unfortunate toads beneath the harrow whom she ruthlessly plunges into the soup.\" Bertie Wooster's half-forgotten vocabulary also provides a further humorous device. In \"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit\" Bertie asks Jeeves \"Let a plugugly like young Thos loose in the community with a cosh, and you are inviting disaster and\u00a0... what's the word?

Wodehouse believed that one of the factors that made his stories humorous was his view of life, and he stated that \"If you take life fairly easily, then you take a humorous view of things. It's probably because you were born that way.\" He carried this view through into his writing, describing the approach as \"making the thing a sort of musical comedy without music, and ignoring real life altogether\". The literary critic Edward L. Galligan considers Wodehouse's stories to show his mastery in adapting the form of the American musical comedy for his writings. Wodehouse would ensure that his first draft was as carefully and accurately done as possible, correcting and refining the prose as he wrote, and would then make another good copy, before proof reading again and then making a final copy for his publisher. Most of Wodehouse's canon is set in an undated period around the 1920s and 1930s. The critic Anthony Lejeune describes the settings of Wodehouse's novels, such as the Drones Club and Blandings Castle, as \"a fairyland\". Although some critics thought Wodehouse's fiction was based on a world that had never existed, Wodehouse affirmed that \"it did. It was going strong between the wars\", although he agreed that his version was to some extent \"a sort of artificial world of my own creation\". The novels showed a largely unchanging world, regardless of when they were written, and only rarely\u2014and mistakenly in McCrum's view\u2014did Wodehouse allow modernity to intrude, as he did in the 1966 story \"Bingo Bans the Bomb\".",
