Wodehouse said that he based Psmith on the hotelier and impresario Rupert D'Oyly Carte\u2014\"the only thing in my literary career which was handed to me on a silver plate with watercress around it\". Wodehouse wrote in the 1970s that a cousin of his who had been at school with Carte told him of the latter's monocle, studied suavity, and stateliness of speech, all of which Wodehouse adopted for his new character. Psmith featured in three more novels: \"Psmith in the City\" (1910), a burlesque of banking; \"Psmith, Journalist\" (1915) set in New York; and \"Leave It to Psmith\" (1923), set at Blandings Castle.",

Ineligible for military service because of his poor eyesight, he remained in the US throughout the war, detached from the conflict in Europe and absorbed in his theatrical and literary concerns. In September 1914 he married Ethel May Wayman, \"n\u00e9e\" Newton (1885\u20131984), an English widow. The marriage proved happy and lifelong. Ethel's personality was in contrast with her husband's: he was shy and impractical; she was gregarious, decisive and well organised. In Sproat's phrase, she \"took charge of Wodehouse's life and made certain that he had the peace and quiet he needed to write\". There were no children of the marriage, but Wodehouse came to love Ethel's daughter Leonora (1905\u20131944) and legally adopted her. Wodehouse experimented with different genres of fiction in these years; his \"Psmith, Journalist\", mixing comedy with social comment on slum landlords and racketeers, was published in 1915. In the same year \"The Saturday Evening Post\" paid $3,500 to serialise \"Something New\", the first of what became a series of novels set at Blandings Castle. It was published in hardback in the US and the UK in the same year (the British edition being retitled \"Something Fresh\"). It was Wodehouse's first farcical novel; it was also his first best-seller, and although his later books included some gentler, lightly sentimental stories, it was as a farceur that he became known. Later in the same year \"Extricating Young Gussie\", the first story about Bertie and Jeeves, was published. These stories introduced two sets of characters about whom Wodehouse wrote for the rest of his life. The Blandings Castle stories, set in an English stately home, depict the attempts of the placid Lord Emsworth to evade the many distractions around him, which include successive pairs of young lovers, the machinations of his exuberant brother Galahad, the demands of his domineering sisters and super-efficient secretaries, and anything detrimental to his prize sow, the Empress of Blandings. The Bertie and Jeeves stories feature an amiable young man-about-town, regularly rescued from the consequences of his idiocy by the benign interference of his valet.",

In honour of Dahl, the Royal Gibraltar Post Office issued a set of four stamps in 2010 featuring Quentin Blake's original illustrations for four of the children's books written by Dahl during his long career; \"The BFG\", \"The Twits\", \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", and \"Matilda\". A set of six stamps was issued by Royal Mail in 2012, featuring Blake's illustrations for \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", \"The Twits\", \"The Witches\", \"Matilda\", \"Fantastic Mr Fox\", and \"James and the Giant Peach\". Dahl's influence has extended beyond literary figures. For instance film director Tim Burton recalled from childhood \"the second layer [after Dr. Seuss] of connecting to a writer who gets the idea of the modern fable \u2013 and the mixture of light and darkness, and not speaking down to kids, and the kind of politically incorrect humour that kids get. I've always like that, and it's shaped everything I've felt that I've done.\" Steven Spielberg read \"The BFG\" to his children when they were young, stating the book celebrates the fact that it's OK to be different as well as to have an active imagination: \"It's very important that we preserve the tradition of allowing young children to run free with their imaginations and magic and imagination are the same thing.\" Actress Scarlett Johansson named \"Fantastic Mr Fox\" one of the five books that made a difference to her. Regarded as \"one of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century\", Dahl was named by \"The Times\" one of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945. He ranks amongst the world's best-selling fiction authors with sales estimated at over 250\u00a0million, and his books have been published in almost 60 languages. In 2003 four books by Dahl, led by \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" at number 35, ranked among the Top 100 in \"The Big Read\", a survey of the British public by the BBC to determine the \"nation's best-loved novel\" of all time. In surveys of UK teachers, parents and students, Dahl is frequently ranked the best children's writer. In a 2006 list for the Royal Society of Literature, Harry Potter creator J. K. Rowling named \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" one of her top ten books every child should read. In 2012, \"Matilda\" was ranked number 30 among all-time best children's novels in a survey published by \"School Library Journal\", a monthly with primarily U.S. audience. The Top 100 included four books by Dahl, more than any other writer: \"Matilda\", \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", \"The Witches\", and \"The BFG\". In 2012, Dahl was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork \u2013 the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album cover \u2013 to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life he most admires. In a 2017 UK poll of the greatest authors, songwriters, artists and photographers, Dahl was named the greatest storyteller of all time, ranking ahead of Dickens, Shakespeare, Rowling and Spielberg.",

Mother and son sailed for Hong Kong, where for his first two years Wodehouse was raised by a Chinese amah (nurse), alongside his elder brothers Peveril (1877\u20131951) and Armine (1879\u20131936). When he was two, the brothers were brought to England, where they were placed under the care of an English nanny in a house adjoining that of Eleanor's father and mother. The boys' parents returned to Hong Kong and became virtual strangers to their sons. Such an arrangement was then normal for middle-class families based in the colonies. The lack of parental contact, and the harsh regime of some of those \"in loco parentis\", left permanent emotional scars on many children from similar backgrounds, including the writers Thackeray, Saki, Kipling and Walpole. Wodehouse was more fortunate; his nanny, Emma Roper, was strict but not unkind, and both with her and later at his different schools Wodehouse had a generally happy childhood. His recollection was that \"it went like a breeze from start to finish, with everybody I met understanding me perfectly\". The biographer Robert McCrum suggests that nonetheless Wodehouse's isolation from his parents left a psychological mark, causing him to avoid emotional engagement both in life and in his works. Another biographer, Frances Donaldson, writes, \"Deprived so early, not merely of maternal love, but of home life and even a stable background, Wodehouse consoled himself from the youngest age in an imaginary world of his own.\"",

Wodehouse's early career as a lyricist and playwright was profitable, and his work with Bolton, according to \"The Guardian\", \"was one of the most successful in the history of musical comedy\". At the outbreak of the Second World War he was earning \u00a340,000 a year from his work, which had broadened to include novels and short stories. Following the furore ensuing from the wartime broadcasts, he suffered a downturn in his popularity and book sales; \"The Saturday Evening Post\" stopped publishing his short stories, a stance they reversed in 1965, although his popularity\u2014and the sales figures\u2014slowly recovered over time. Wodehouse received great praise from many of his contemporaries, including Max Beerbohm, Rudyard Kipling, A.E. Housman and Evelyn Waugh\u2014the last of whom opines: \"One has to regard a man as a Master who can produce on average three uniquely brilliant and entirely original similes on each page.\" There are dissenters to the praise. The writer Alan Bennett thinks that \"inspired though his language is, I can never take more than ten pages of the novels at a time, their relentless flippancy wearing and tedious\", while the literary critic F. R. Leavis writes that Wodehouse had a \"stereotyped humour\u00a0... of ingenious variations on a laugh in one place\". In a 2010 study of Wodehouse's few relatively serious novels, such as \"The Coming of Bill\" (1919), \"Jill the Reckless\" (1920) and \"The Adventures of Sally\" (1922), David Heddendorf concludes that though their literary quality does not match that of the farcical novels, they show a range of empathy and interests that in real life\u2014and in his most comic works\u2014the author seemed to lack. \"Never oblivious to grief and despair, he opts in clear-eyed awareness for his timeless world of spats and woolly-headed peers. It's an austere, almost bloodless preference for pristine artifice over the pain and messy outcomes of actual existence, but it's a case of Wodehouse keeping faith with his own unique art.\"",
