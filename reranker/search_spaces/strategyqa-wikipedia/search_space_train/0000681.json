Further complicating matters, a 2009 paper coined the English term \"Naga king chili\" which refers to the chili's large pod size. This is probably because the chili has long been colloquially known as \"Raja mircha\" or \"Raja mirchi\" in Nagaland. It also stated that the most common Indian (Assamese) usage is \"bh\u00fbt z\u00f4l\u00f4kiya\" (\u09ad\u09cb\u099f \u099c\u09b2\u0995\u09c0\u09af\u09bc\u09be) and gives the alternate common name as \"bih z\u00f4l\u00f4kia\" (\u09ac\u09bf\u09b9 \u099c\u09b2\u0995\u09c0\u09af\u09bc\u09be, \"bih\" means \"poison\" in Assamese, denoting the plant's heat). The Assamese word \"z\u00f4l\u00f4kia\" simply means the \"Capsicum\" pepper. Other usages on the subcontinent are \"saga jlokia\", Indian mystery chili, and Indian rough chili (after the chili's rough skin). It has also been called the Tezpur chili after the Assamese city of Tezpur. In Manipur, the chili is called \"umorok\" or \"oo-morok\" (\"oo\" = \"tree\", \"morok\" = \"chili\").
