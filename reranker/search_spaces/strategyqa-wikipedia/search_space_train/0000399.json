Genghis had designated several of the territories south of the Caucasus to Jochi, specifically Georgia, and the Seljukid Sultanate.

We emphasize, however, that whenever formal inferences about population history have been attempted with uniparental systems, the statistical power is generally low. Claims of connections, therefore, between specific uniparental lineages and historical figures or historical migrations of peoples are merely speculative.Research published in 2016 suggested that Genghis possibly belonged to the haplogroup R-M343 (R1b). The controversial result was based on analysis of five bodies, dating from about 1130\u20131250, that were found in graves in Tavan Tolgoi, Mongolia. The remains of all 5 bodies belong to the Mongoloid physical type and are believed to be possibly related to members of the Mongol \"Golden Family\", at around the time of Genghis Khan, although it is uncertain whether the Y-DNA haplogroup marker belongs to the Borijigin clan or the products of clan marriages between the female lineage of Genghis Khan\u2019s Borjigin clan and males of other clans/tribes from Mongolia or Central Asia.",

Describing the character interaction between Asano and Honglei, he noted \"They're completely different people, Tem\u00fcjin and Jamukha, but they have a strong relationship, strong feelings between them.\" Aside from the Chinese and Japanese actors for those roles, the rest of the cast were Mongolian. It marked the first time a tale of Genghis Khan would be acted by Asians, this in contrast to such Hollywood and European attempts like the 1956 movie flop \"The Conqueror\" and the 1965 film \"Genghis Khan\" with Omar Sharif.",

Shortly after B\u00f6rte's marriage to Genghis Khan (known as Tem\u00fcjin at the time), she was abducted by members of the Mergid confederation. She was given to a certain Chilger B\u00f6kh, who was the brother of the Yehe Chiledu, as a spoil of war. She remained in Chilger B\u00f6kh's captivity for a few months before she was recovered by Tem\u00fcjin. Shortly afterwards she gave birth to Jochi. By all accounts, Genghis Khan treated Jochi as his first son, but a doubt always remained whether Tem\u00fcjin or Chilger B\u00f6kh was the real father of Jochi. This uncertainty about his paternity was not without consequences. Jochi\u2019s descendants, although they formed the oldest branch of Genghis Khan\u2019s family, were never considered for the succession in claiming their father\u2019s heritage and there were signs of estrangement between Jochi and Genghis Khan.",
