The play will soon be moving to London\u2019s West End. Furthermore, Sanja's goal is to take this story a step further in 2014 by directing a documentary movie about the mysterious life of Nikola Tesla. These projects are highly supported by The Tesla Science Foundation and Office for Cooperation with Diaspora and Serbs in the Region.  Nikola Tesla is finally beginning to attract real attention and encourage serious debate nearly 70 years after his death. Nikola Tesla, Serbian-American scientist, the man who lit the world, gave his greatest contribution to science and technological progress of the world as the inventor of the rotating magnetic field and of the complete system of production and distribution of electrical energy (motors, generators) based on the use of alternate currents. His name was given to the SI unit for magnetic induction (\"tesla\"). Tesla also constructed the generators of high-frequency alternate currents and high-voltage coreless transformer known today as \"Tesla Coil\". Sanja has managed to bring to life moments of Tesla's life that the public had yet to see and displayed important moments and sequences of Tesla's life, which for mysterious reasons have remained a well kept secret to date. Tesla whom we might have referred to as holy, sacred, died before he was recognized as someone who truly marked the history of mankind. Sanja's play was supported by the Office for Cooperation with Diaspora and Serbs in the Region, Consulate General of the Republic of Serbia in New York, Vuk Jeremi\u0107 - Serbian physicist, politician and President of the 67th session of United Nations General Assembly, the Tesla Science Foundation, the Nikola Tesla Club, and the Nikola Tesla Inventors Club in the US.",

All of the USMA alumni who received the Medal of Honor for action in the American Civil War were part of the Union Army fighting against the Confederate States Army to undo the secession of the Confederate States of America. The Civil War was the first war for which the Medal of Honor was granted, and more USMA alumni received this honor for participation in the Civil War than for any other conflict. Of the 3464 American Civil War Medal of Honor recipients, 25 attended USMA. The USMA alumni receiving the Medal of Honor for their efforts in the American Indian Wars fought against the Native Americans in the United States in order to expand the territory controlled by American settlers and the federal government of the United States. Among the American Indian Wars Medal of Honor recipients, 21 were USMA alumni. The Medal of Honor was given to Americans who fought in the Spanish\u2013American War against Spain under the Restoration during the Cuban War of Independence. Four USMA alumni were among the Spanish\u2013American War Medal of Honor recipients. USMA alumni who received the Medal of Honor for participating in the Philippine\u2013American War fought against the First Philippine Republic, the Katipunan, the \"Pulahan\", the Sultanate of Sulu, and the Moro people in order to suppress the Philippine Declaration of Independence. Nine USMA alumni were among the 86 men who received the medal for their involvement in this war. The Medal of Honor was given to two USMA alumni who fought in the Boxer Rebellion in China against the Righteous Harmony Society of the Qing Dynasty in order to defend foreigners and Christians in China. Another 57 Americans received the Medal of Honor for participating in this conflict. Eli Thompson Fryer is the sole USMA alumnus to have received the Medal of Honor for his involvement in the Banana Wars, supporting the United States occupation of Veracruz. All of the 62 other Americans who received the Medal of Honor for fighting in the Banana Wars were involved specifically in the occupation of Veracruz. The United States' involvement in World War I was as a neutral party for most of the war, but included the deployment of expeditionary forces towards the end of the war. Of the 119 Americans who received the Medal of Honor for action in World War I, only one attended USMA: Emory Jenison Pike. At the beginning of World War II, the United States was a neutral party just as it was at the beginning of World War I. Unlike in World War I, however, the United States was involved in World War II in a military capacity for most of the war. Ten of the 464 men who received the Medal of Honor for action in World War II were educated at USMA. The United States and twenty other member states of the United Nations supported South Korea in repelling an invasion by North Korea and its allies into South Korea. For their involvement, 133 Americans were presented with the Medal of Honor, two of whom attended USMA. The United States and other anti-communist countries fought against North Vietnam and its communist allies during the Vietnam War in an attempt to prevent the communist takeover of South Vietnam and, more broadly, to implement the United States' policy of containment to prevent the spread of communism. Eight of the 246 men who received the Medal of Honor for fighting in this war attended USMA.",

The North would not accept this affront of American nationalism, and fought to restore the Union. British and French aristocratic leaders personally disliked American republicanism and favoured the more aristocratic Confederacy.

The actions of North Vietnam in breaking the peace treaty with South Vietnam in 1975 abruptly concluded three decades of United States intervention in Vietnam and brought to a close a painful and bitter era for both countries. From 1954-1975 the United States Military was involved in the development of Vietnam. With fears that the United States would lose Vietnam to communism, the country was divided at the 17th parallel, creating temporarily separate states, the North being communist and the South as a non-communist state. While the southern province had the support of the United States, billions of American dollars were spent in efforts to modernize the country. This involvement increased tensions between the two provinces, resulting in the second Indochina War, otherwise known to the Western World as the \"Vietnam War\". In \"Tours of Vietnam: War, Travel Guides and Memory\", by Scott Laderman, he argues that calling the second Indochina War the Vietnam War \"is to thus reveal a certain bias. Should we therefore call it the \"American War?\" (ix) The war generated considerable social and political discord in the United States, massive disruption in Vietnam, and was enormously costly to both sides. Vietnam endured physical destruction\u2014ravaged battle sites, leveled factories and cities, and untold numbers of military and civilian casualties. The United States escaped physical devastation, but it suffered the loss of 58,000 lives (2,400 unaccounted for) and spent roughly $140 billion ($950 billion in 2011) in direct expenses to build infrastructure, train an army and police force and modernize the young country. The war polarized and disillusioned American society during and after the conflict. For instance, in 1964 the \"Gulf of Tonkin incident\" which many have attributed to overzealous radar officers aboard the USS Maddox, was used as extra justification for Congress' decision to allow the then president, Lyndon B. Johnson, to take any necessary retaliatory measures. A large scandal sprung up and documentaries were produced to argue one side or the other of this controversy. To the Vietnamese communists, the war against the United States simply extended the war for independence initiated against the French. In Hanoi's view, when the United States displaced the French in Indochina, it assumed the French role as a major-power obstacle to Vietnam's eventual reunification under the North's Communist rule.",

The infantry in the American Civil War comprised foot-soldiers who fought primarily with small arms, and carried the brunt of the fighting on battlefields across the United States. Historians have long debated whether the evolution of tactics between 1861 and 1865 marked a seminal point in the evolution of warfare. The conventional narrative is that generals and other officers adhered stubbornly to the tactics of the Napoleonic Wars, in which armies employed linear formations and favored open fields over the usage of cover (whether constructed or natural in origin). Presumably, the greater accuracy and range of the rifle musket rendered that approach obsolete, and the Civil War armies' transition to longer battles in 1864 is taken by numerous scholars as proof of the new technology's transformative impact. More recently, however, academics have begun to reject this narrative. Earl J. Hess judges the tactical training of the Civil War as critical to the armies' success, and maintains that the dearth of overwhelming victories during the conflict was actually consistent with the infrequency of such battles throughout history. Allen C. Guelzo contends that rifle muskets did not revolutionize land warfare due to a combination of inadequate firearms training and the poor visibility caused by black powder. This debate has implications not only for the nature of the soldier's experience, but also for the broader question of the Civil War's relative modernity. Williamson Murray and Wayne Wei-Siang Hsieh argue that the conflict was resulted from \"the combination...of the Industrial Revolution and French Revolution [which] allowed the opposing sides to mobilize immense numbers of soldiers while projecting military power over great distances.\" The Civil War involved a number of other recently-introduced and new technologies, including military balloons, repeating rifles, the telegraph, and railroads.",
