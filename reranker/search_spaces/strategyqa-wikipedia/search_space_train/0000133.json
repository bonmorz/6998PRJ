In 1994 Kim (1000m) and American Cathy Turner (500m) became the first to successfully defend their respective Olympic title; Kim thus became the first short-tracker to win three Olympic gold medals.

Ahn also won a bronze medal in the same Games, becoming the first (and thus far, only) short-tracker to win four medals in one Olympic; he repeated the same feat in 2014.
