Although they occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average, it is estimated that they recur at any given place only once every 360 to 410 years, on average. The total eclipse lasts for only a maximum of a few minutes at any location, because the Moon's umbra moves eastward at over 1700\u00a0km/h. Totality currently can never last more than 7\u00a0min 32\u00a0s. This value changes over the millennia and is currently decreasing. By the 8th millennium, the longest theoretically possible total eclipse will be less than 7\u00a0min 2\u00a0s. The last time an eclipse longer than 7 minutes occurred was June 30, 1973 (7 min 3 sec). Observers aboard a Concorde supersonic aircraft were able to stretch totality for this eclipse to about 74 minutes by flying along the path of the Moon's umbra. The next total eclipse exceeding seven minutes in duration will not occur until June 25, 2150. The longest total solar eclipse during the 11,000 year period from 3000 BC to at least 8000 AD will occur on July 16, 2186, when totality will last 7\u00a0min 29\u00a0s. For comparison, the longest total eclipse of the 20th century at 7\u00a0min 8\u00a0s occurred on June 20, 1955, and there are no total solar eclipses over 7\u00a0min in duration in the 21st century.",

Each saros series starts with a partial eclipse (Sun first enters the end of the node), and each successive saros the path of the Moon is shifted either northward (when near the descending node) or southward (when near the ascending node) due to the fact that the saros is not an exact integer of draconic months (about one hour short). At some point, eclipses are no longer possible and the series terminates (Sun leaves the beginning of the node). An arbitrary solar saros series was designated as solar saros series 1 by compilers of eclipse statistics. This series has finished, but the eclipse of November 16, 1990 BC (Julian calendar) for example is in solar saros series 1. There are different saros series for solar and lunar eclipses. For lunar saros series, the lunar eclipse occurring 58.5 synodic months earlier (February 23, 1994 BC) was assigned the number 1. If there is an eclipse one inex (29 years minus about 20 days) after an eclipse of a particular saros series then it is a member of the next series. For example, the eclipse of October 26, 1961 BC is in solar saros series 2. Saros series, of course, went on before these dates, and it is necessary to extend the saros series numbers backwards to negative numbers even just to accommodate eclipses occurring in the years following 2000 BCE (up till the last eclipse with a negative saros number in 1367 BC). For solar eclipses the statistics for the complete saros series within the era between 2000 BCE and 3000 CE are given in this article's references. It takes between 1226 and 1550 years for the members of a saros series to traverse the Earth's surface from north to south (or vice versa).
