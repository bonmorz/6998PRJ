Though Crawford had been a notable film star during the 1930s and 1940s, according to David Bret, author of \"Joan Crawford: Hollywood Martyr\", it was not until her 1953 film \"Torch Song\" that she was seen as a \"complete gay icon, primarily because it was shot in color.\" Bret explains that seeing the actress' red hair, dark eyes and \"Victory Red\" lips linked her to \"gaydom's other sirens: Dietrich, Garland, Bankhead, Piaf, and new recruits Marilyn Monroe and Maria Callas.\"",
