The subsonic Boeing B-47 Stratojet and Boeing B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers were followed by the Mach\u00a02 Convair B-58 Hustler, with the Mach\u00a03 North American B-70 Valkyrie on the drawing board at that time. A major upgrade in the PVO defence system was required, and at the start of 1958 a requirement was issued for manned interceptors capable of reaching 3,000\u00a0km/h (1,864\u00a0mph) and heights of up to 27\u00a0km (88,583\u00a0ft). Mikoyan and Sukhoi responded. The Mikoyan-Gurevich OKB had been working on a series of interceptors during the second half of the 1950s: the I-1, I-3U, I-7U, I-75, Ye-150, Ye-150A, Ye-152, Ye-152A, Ye-152P, and Ye-152M. The Ye-150 was noteworthy because it was built specifically to test the Tumansky R-15 engine, two of which would later be used for the MiG-25. This led to Ye-152, alternatively known as Ye-166, which set several world records. The Ye-152M (converted from one of the two Ye-152 aircraft) was intended to be the definite heavy interceptor design. But before it was finished, the PVO had selected the Tupolev Tu-128. As the work on the MiG-25 was well under way, the single-engine Ye-152M was abandoned.",

In 2011, the Rudd Center published a study in the journal \"Public Health Nutrition\" suggesting that additional government regulation of front-of-package labeling is needed to protect consumers. Through an online survey, researchers asked parents with children between the ages of 2 and 11 to view images of actual box fronts of children's cereals. While the cereals were of below-average nutritional quality, the boxes featured various nutrition-related health claims including 'whole grain', 'fiber', 'calcium and vitamin D', 'organic' and 'supports your child's immunity'. Participants were provided with possible meanings for these claims and indicated how the claims would affect their willingness to buy the product. Parents inferred that cereals containing claims were more nutritious overall and might provide specific health-related benefits for their children, which predicted a greater willingness to buy the cereals. According to John Bode, to expect for the food industry to voluntarily stop marketing junk to children is unrealistic and therefore makes no sense. However, Food industry advocates claim the industry is heavily regulated and if we start adding stricter regulations then the consumer is ultimately denied choice. The way that food industry markets food and perceive different categories of food has worsened the body images of the American population. Our food environment has continually increased our populations' weight, appearance standards have remained severe, more people are dieting, more people are fighting their bodies, and more people have perverted relationships with food. Due to rising global concerns about the increasing occurrence of childhood overweight and obesity, the World Health Organization and the Institute of Medicine have both called on the private sector to address these problems. The Rudd Center has debuted a database for pledges on food marketing to children; listed in the Rudd Center database are the voluntary pledges issued by food and beverage companies to change marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children. To persuade the food industry to self-regulate, the Rudd Center organized a pledge initiative in which participants, many major global food and beverage companies, in conjunction with industry trade organizations, have issued voluntary pledges to change marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children.O Rudd makes available on its website a database that lists and describes these pledges, making publicly available the specific criteria each pledge or company uses to define their restrictions on marketing communications to children, including the definition of \"children\" (age); the definition of marketing directed at children (child-directed media); the communications channels (e.g. television, Internet, etc.) and marketing techniques (ex. advertising using licensed characters, advertising using promotional materials, etc.) covered. The self-regulation includes all participating companies. Most of the pledges* require participating companies to publish individual commitments to the pledges**, which may contain more stringent definitions than specified in the pledges. A minority of pledges do not require commitments from participating companies. In these cases the criteria set out in the pledge cover all members. On the other hand , according to Elaine Kolish, vice president of the Childrens Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI) states that it is wholly inappropriate for government regulation. She claims that, \" products being sold to children are legal\" , it is the adults (parents) who are buying the products. Participants include such global food corporations as Mondelez International, Nestle, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, and Parmalat.",

            "document": "Vicki Vann . Vann created a sister publication to Beverage Industry News Magazine that is consumer slanted called Drink Style Magazine. It is a quarterly published publication with the first issue in January, 2016. The magazine features expert, in-depth information about leading products in wine, beer, spirits and cocktails from around the world, all with eye-popping images and engaging stories. Readers will be able to go on wine vineyard tours, meet wine producers, learn what it means to be a wine sommelier, and get user-friendly information about top vintages, regions, varietals and styles. Visit new and pioneering craft breweries and discover the best beers to drink in any season, in any setting, from hoppy ales to session beers to sip during those long sports matches to what\u2019s on draft at the newest craft beer destinations. Readers can enjoy pulling up a stool to have a snack at the hottest cocktail bar openings around the world, and keep up with creative mixology trends, meet bar personalities and find new and exotic ingredients for assemblage. The magazine also consists of traveling behind the scenes to distilleries and helps the reader stay ahead of the latest spirits releases while keeping the back bar up to date, from high-profile portfolios as well as niche brands. The pages consist of the simple art of learning how to wine and dine in top destinations from the most coveted street carts to swank venues. The reader has the opportunity to become the host with the most, using state of the art tips and recipes for home entertainment and enjoyment.  Vann created Araceli Spirits, LLC., in 2013, which is a company created to introduce unique spirits and beverages. The company was started with the introduction of Araceli Marigold Liqueur, the world's very first liqueur of its kind, which is available to consumers at stores and online outlets throughout the United States. Araceli Marigold Liqueur is a vision that was created by Victoria. She serves as owner and brand ambassador of the brand. The liqueur is a tribute to the Hispanic traditional holiday; El D\u00eda de los muertos, and pays tribute to the sacred marigold flower, honoring the celebration and love of people and life. In 2015 Vann created an evaluation system as the 21st Century award for quality and credibility called Liquor Rank. It exists to provide the definitive last word on spirits and beverage evaluation and provide you limitless opportunities to market your brand. Each product is reviewed under ideal tasting conditions by a panel of experts of which Vann is a seat member, who know what they and ultimately consumers, are looking for. Each product submitted to Liquor Rank is evaluated and ranked in blind tastings ensuring your rank is bias free. Beer wine and spirits industry trade buyers and consumers recognize and respond to the value of Liquor Rank's accolades and scores, setting itself apart from over saturated liquor competitions that will hand over a medal to almost anyone who enters, Liquor Rank is different; it's the last word on quality. A favorable Liquor Rank is easily and immediately recognized as a symbol of achievement as it was earned via the ultimate definition of balanced spirits evaluation. Your brand truly earns its score, it doesn't just get awarded a medal for showing up. Victoria has said this about how \"Liquor Rank\" works, \"Literally, you take a number, and we all know numbers are useful. They help us count; our money, our time, and just where we stand in the world. In the world of selling more liquor it is your \"Liquor Rank\" that counts. You put your heart and soul into this spirit, now it's time to tell everyone just how good it is. Your \"Liquor Rank\" is based on your product and your product alone. It's not about how you stack up against the next guy, not what another category is doing in terms of increasing their sales and market penetration, but, quite simply your \"Liquor Rank\" reflects the positive qualities your liquid brings to the glass. \"Liquor Rank\" is the defining number that, at a glance, allows buyers and consumers to know just what to expect when they pick up your bottle. Like well respected wine industry ratings systems \"Liquor Rank\" is based on a 20 point scale, set from 80-100. Your product is judged on its merits; taste, texture, color, aroma, mixability, and price. All of these factors are considered by our panel of experts.\"",

He also believed that cooperatives did not need to be autarkic, but rather \"organically connected, through the process of production itself, with other cooperatives and with the state economic sector.\" Vietnam could achieve this through state intervention and control.

The first batch of single malt whisky was ready within 18 months. Because India had no culture of consuming single malts at the time, the company did not consider bottling it as a single malt. Instead, the whisky was blended with alcohol distilled from sugarcane to produce MaQintosh Premium Whisky. According to Neelakanta Jagdale, \"The alcoholic beverages industry was not a priority in the country. Although we received help to a certain extent from the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), we had to find our own ways to learn about improved distilling methods\". Amrut Distilleries launched Amrut, the first single malt whisky to be made in India, on 24 August 2004. The production of Amrut single malt whisky was the result of the distillery having malt that was ageing far in excess of what was needed for its medium range Prestige Malt Whisky. Initially, Amrut aged malt whisky for around a year before blending it. However, due to changing customer preferences, less malt whisky was being added into blended variants. Surinder Kumar, the master blender at Amrut Distilleries, has estimated that because of climate differences, one year of barrel ageing in India is equal to three years of ageing in Scotland.",
