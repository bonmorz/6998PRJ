The article presented data to show that sexual abuse is no higher among celibate clergy than in other areas and that media reports present an inflated picture of the scale of the problem. It decried the \"moral panic\" surrounding the subject of clerical sexual abuse. In 2011, when Polish church officials were downplaying the need for a commission to establish procedures for handling cases of clerical sexual abuse, he told a Polish magazine that \"If the church in Poland doesn't confront this reality and doesn't take the bull by the horns, the same thing will happen which we witnessed in the United States, Canada, Ireland, Germany, Austria and recently in Belgium. If the church doesn't know how to react to such situations because it hasn't bothered to ascertain the facts, its image will suffer much more than if it had said, 'Yes, we had such cases -- they were very painful, but we tackled them.'\" Addressing church workers in Australia in September 2017, Zollner said that in Australia \"there seems to be almost nil trust in what the Church says ... This is not true in other parts of the world. I think you are in a pretty unique situation\". He thought Europe and North America had made progress in dealing with clerical sexual abuse, but \"It has not yet hit the surface of public interest and discussion and news in 75 per cent of countries, if not more. I cannot say where or when it will hit, but it will hit.\"",

About 300, the Synod of Elvira called for clerical celibacy . Clerical celibacy began to be enforced in papal decretals beginning with Pope Siricius (d. 399).

Premarital sex could be punished by up to 100 lashes, while adultery is punishable by stoning. The act of sexual penetration must, however, be attested by at least four male Muslim witnesses of good character, the accused has a right to testify in court, the suspect's word or testimony is required to hold the most weight in the eyes of the judge(s), punishments are reserved to the legal authorities and the law states that false accusations are to be punished severely. The former regulations also make some Muslims believe, that the process's goal was to eventually abolish the physical penalties relating to acts of fornication and adultery that were already present within many societies around the world when Islamic teachings first arose. According to this view, the principles are so rigorous in their search for evidence, that they create the near impossibility of being able to reach a verdict that goes against the suspect in any manner.",
