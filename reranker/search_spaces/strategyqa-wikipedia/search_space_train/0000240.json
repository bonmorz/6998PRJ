One scholar defends Julius II's patronage by stating: \"\u201cIt must not be forgotten that not all messages conveyed in works commissioned by a patron, let alone those merely addressed to him, can be read as a communication by the patron of his thinking and claims and aspirations. To say this is not to deny that messages may be read into them, but it should not be assumed that patrons would necessarily have cared about or understood or been motivated by theories and statements about their power and authority that may be coded into the works of art they paid for\". \" (Gosman, 61)",

Henry David Thoreau writes in \"Civil Disobedience\": Christ answered the Herodians according to their condition. \"Show me the tribute-money,\" said he; \u2013 and one took a penny out of his pocket; \u2013 If you use money which has the image of Caesar on it, and which he has made current and valuable, that is, if you are men of the State, and gladly enjoy the advantages of Caesar's government, then pay him back some of his own when he demands it; \"Render therefore to Caesar that which is Caesar's and to God those things which are God's\" \u2013 leaving them no wiser than before as to which was which; for they did not wish to know. Mennonite Dale Glass-Hess wrote: It is inconceivable to me that Jesus would teach that some spheres of human activity lie outside the authority of God. Are we to heed Caesar when he says to go to war or support war-making when Jesus says in other places that we shall not kill? No! My perception of this incident is that Jesus does not answer the question about the morality of paying taxes to Caesar, but that he throws it back on the people to decide. When the Jews produce a denarius at Jesus' request, they demonstrate that they are already doing business with Caesar on Caesar's terms. I read Jesus' statement, \"Give to Caesar\u2026\" as meaning \"Have you incurred a debt in regard to Caesar! Then you better pay it off.\" The Jews had already compromised themselves. Likewise for us: we may refuse to serve Caesar as soldiers and even try to resist paying for Caesar's army. But the fact is that by our lifestyles we've run up a debt with Caesar, who has felt constrained to defend the interests that support our lifestyles. Now he wants paid back, and it's a little late to say that we don't owe anything. We've already compromised ourselves. If we're going to play Caesar's games, then we should expect to have to pay for the pleasure of their enjoyment. But if we are determined to avoid those games, then we should be able to avoid paying for them. Mohandas K. Gandhi shared this perspective. He wrote: Jesus evaded the direct question put to him because it was a trap. He was in no way bound to answer it. He therefore asked to see the coin for taxes. And then said with withering scorn, \"How can you who traffic in Caesar's coins and thus receive what to you are benefits of Caesar's rule refuse to pay taxes?\" Jesus' whole preaching and practice point unmistakably to noncooperation, which necessarily includes nonpayment of taxes.",

The word \u201ccaesarian\u201d possibly derives from the ancient Roman ruler Julius Caesar, because it was believed that Caesar was delivered through this procedure. However, this is probably based more on tradition and myth than historical accuracies. Another possibility for the etymology of the word \u201ccaesarian\u201d is the Latin word \"caedere\", meaning \u201cto cut\u201d. This practice is probably much older than Julius Caesar, but \"C-sections\", as performed by the Romans, were done to rescue the baby from a dying or already dead mother, and were performed post-mortem. Evidence suggests that Jews in ancient Rome successfully practiced C-sections on living mothers who were not in danger of dying. Evidence of these procedures is found in several collections of ancient Roman rabbis, the most famous of which is called the Mishnah. Greeks and Egyptians did not perform C-sections, either post-mortem or on living mothers. However, Greeks would have had at least some knowledge of the Caesarian operation and the procedure involved. The Greek god Aesclepius was fabled to have been extracted from his mother\u2019s womb through this procedure. Other than the evidence of Jews practicing C-sections in antiquity (very little in ancient Rome, even less in ancient Greece), not much more evidence exists regarding Caesarian-operation birth. One reason could have been that C-sections were not performed very often because of medical complications or superstitions surrounding C-sections. In early Christian Rome, C-sections were almost non-existent. Loss of skill is a possibility for the lack of C-sections. Infant mortality rates were high in antiquity, so C-sections certainly could have been useful. However, early Christian doctors could have disregarded C-sections as a socially acceptable operation because of religious beliefs. Disease, a perceived need for secrecy, and social discouragement could have also been factors that lead to the decline in C-sections among early Christians in Rome. Almost no evidence exists for C-sections in the Christian world until the 10th century.",

One of the first European physicians to study jamu was Jacobus Bontius (Jacob de Bondt), who was a physician in Batavia (today's Jakarta) in the early seventeenth century. His writings contain information about indigenous medicine. A comprehensive book on indigenous herbal medicine in the Indies was published by Rumphius, who worked on Ambon during the early eighteenth century. He published a book called \"Herbaria Amboinesis (The Ambonese Spice Book)\". During the nineteenth century, European physicians had a keen interest in jamu, as they often did not know how to treat the diseases they encountered in their patients in the Indies. The German physician Carl Waitz published on jamu in 1829. In the 1880s and 1890s, A.G. Vorderman published extensive accounts on jamu as well. Pharmacological research on herbal medicine was undertaken by M. Greshoff and W.G. Boorsma at the pharmacological laboratory at the Bogor Botanical Garden",

The thesis of Carotta's book \"Jesus was Caesar\" is based on a comparison of the gospels, especially the earliest Gospel of Mark, with the ancient sources about the last years in the life of Caesar and his immediate legacy. Roman sources include Appian, Plutarch and Suetonius, who all relied to some extent on Caesar's contemporary Gaius Asinius Pollio and his lost \"Historiae\", which according to Carotta might constitute the \"Latin Ur-Gospel\". This is augmented by comparisons from archaeology, numismatics, iconography, liturgy, and ritual traditions. Carotta argues that the multiple parallels he sees between the lives and cults of Caesar and Jesus can best be explained by his theory that Jesus Christ is based on the deified Julius Caesar, transformed and mirrored in the eastern Hellenistic and judaizing regions of the Roman Empire.",

            "document": "The Jesus Mysteries . New Testament scholar and secular agnostic Bart D. Ehrman, in a 2007 interview with the \"Fortean Times\", was similarly asked for his views on the work of Freke and Gandy. Not having read their work, he responded by commenting on the thesis, \"This is an old argument, even though it shows up every 10 years or so. This current craze that Christianity was a mystery religion like these other mystery religions-the people who are saying this are almost always people who know nothing about the mystery religions; they've read a few popular books, but they're not scholars of mystery religions. The reality is, we know very little about mystery religions-the whole point of mystery religions is that they're secret! So I think it's crazy to build on ignorance in order to make a claim like this.\" In his 2012 book \"Did Jesus Exist?\", Ehrman, now having actually read the book, addresses many of Freke and Gandy's assertions, demonstrating why they do not hold up to scholarly criticism. According to Ehrman's analysis, most of Freke and Gandy's alleged evidence is either fabricated, the result of gross misinterpretation, or mere bald assertion based on the claims of other writers rather than actual historical evidence. Ehrman concludes, \"This is not serious scholarship. It is sensationalist writing driven by a desire to sell books.\" He also remarks that \"In both its detail and its overarching thesis, the book often reads like an undergraduate thesis, filled with patently false information and inconsistencies.\" He then provides a long list of examples of serious historical errors in the book, as well as places where Freke and Gandy's own arguments contradict each other.",

Memnon's history encompassed an unknown number of books, but Photius had read the ninth through the sixteenth, and made a tolerably copious abstract of that portion.

To others, it was merely an outlandish hoax. One described it as reading \"like a Semitic philologist's erotic nightmare\". The book has been described as \"\"notorious\"\" and as \"\"one of the strangest books ever published on the subject of religion and pharmacology\"\". There was a media frenzy when it was published at the dawn of the 1970s. This caused the publisher to apologize for issuing it and forced Allegro's resignation from his university position. Judith Anne Brown suggested that the book was \"\"difficult to read and difficult to summarize, because he follows clues that criss-cross different cultures and lead into many-layered webs of association\"\". Mark Hall writes that Allegro suggested the scrolls all but proved that a historical Jesus never existed. Philip Jenkins writes that Allegro was an eccentric scholar who relied on texts that did not exist in quite the form he was citing them, and calls the \"Sacred Mushroom and the Cross\" \"possibly the single most ludicrous book on Jesus scholarship by a qualified academic\".",
