During her own series, Xena spends almost every episode on a different mission, always trying to do the right thing, fighting for what she refers to as the \"greater good\". Xena's trademark weapon is a Chakram, and she also uses a sword. Xena also has to fight her own past; she has never forgiven herself for her crimes, and often has to resist the temptation to return to her evil ways, but she always resists with the help of Gabrielle. Gabrielle is Xena's best friend and also her greatest ally. She is introduced in the first episode, first as a big fan of Xena and her history, but soon becomes a notable character in her own right. As the show progresses she undergoes significant changes in costume and style, evolving from a simple farm girl to a talented bard, and eventually to a formidable warrior. She is initiated into a tribe of Amazons, learns to fight with a staff, and is trained by Xena. In the first season, Xena and Gabrielle meet Joxer, a comic man who styles himself \"Joxer the Magnificent\", and later \"Joxer the Mighty.\" Joxer's goal is to fight for justice, but unfortunately with no physical know-how of his own, he remains the show's main comic relief.
