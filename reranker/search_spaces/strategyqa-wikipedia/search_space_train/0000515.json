However, the film was a turning point in Hedren's life. In 1983, she established the non-profit organization \"The Roar Foundation\", to take care of the big cats; as she later explained, \"After our movie was over, it was unconscionable to see the animals go any place else. We said we would become a foundation so that we can take in donations so that we can keep the cats here, and that is what we did.\" \"Roar\" was later re-released in 2015 but Hedren declined to discuss it as she felt that promotion for the film was filled with \"inaccuracies\". However, she expressed regrets at letting a fully grown lion live with her family in the 1970s, saying they were \"stupid beyond belief to have that lion in our house. We should never have taken those risks. These animals are so fast, and if they decide to go after you, nothing but a bullet to the brain will stop them.\"",

Items such as garbage, pet food, and sometimes feeding stations for birds and squirrels attract coyotes into backyards. About three to five pets attacked by coyotes are brought into the Animal Urgent Care hospital of South Orange County (California) each week, the majority of which are dogs, since cats typically do not survive the attacks. Scat analysis collected near Claremont, California, revealed that coyotes relied heavily on pets as a food source in winter and spring. At one location in Southern California, coyotes began relying on a colony of feral cats as a food source. Over time, the coyotes killed most of the cats, and then continued to eat the cat food placed daily at the colony site by people who were maintaining the cat colony. Coyotes usually attack smaller-sized dogs, but they have been known to attack even large, powerful breeds such as the Rottweiler in exceptional cases. Dogs larger than coyotes, such as greyhounds, are generally able to drive them off, and have been known to kill coyotes. Smaller breeds are more likely to suffer injury or death.",

You make these movies for the fanboys, but nowadays everyone seems to pirate them rather than watch them in the movie theatre. \"Kick-Ass 2\" was one of the number one pirated movies of the year, but that doesn't help us because we need box office figures. We need to prove to the distributors that we can make money from a third and a fourth movie - but because it didn't do so well, we can't make another one. If you want more than one movie, everyone has to go and see movies at the cinema. It's all about the numbers in the theatre.\" In June 2014, Millar confirmed that the plans for \"Kick-Ass 3\" will indeed move forward as the fan base is strong enough for interest to be sustained. In August 2014, Millar confirmed that the plan has always been to make three films based off the three books. In August 2014, Millar said a third film is still up in the air and that it's ultimately Matthew Vaughn's decision as he has the film rights.",

The villains are bad, but not subhuman, and at the end I was positively grateful for a scene where the bad guy tries to get away in a wagon full of gold, with the heroine tied up behind him, and Henry and the dog trying to save her. This was so old-fashioned it was almost daring.\" Rita Kempley from The Washington Post didn't like the film. She praised the animals' performances, but criticized the human actors. \"The animal actors are superb -- you really think White Fang is a goner in a couple of instances -- but the humans have basically reached the level of their own incompetence. Perhaps no one in the cast was able to obey Chief Moses Joseph's injunction to set the inner wolf free. The audience, on the other hand, will surely be howling.\" Lois Alter Mark from Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B rating, concluding that \"White Fang 2\" would be a better film if the filmmakers gave the \"four-legged hero\" more screen time. \"If only White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf had kept the camera on its four-legged hero and let animal trainer Joe Camp (Homeward Bound) work his magic, it too could have been as effective as jujubes in keeping kids glued to their seats.\" Robert Faires from The Austin Chronicle gave the film three out of five stars. He also opined that the movie gets better when the animals are on the screen. \"It's best when the wolves are moving. Maybe when the third one is made -- the final scene screams White Fang: The Next Generation -- they'll leave the humans out of it and just run with the pack.\" \"The Movie Scene\" also gave the film three out of five stars, stating that \"White Fang 2\" is not a bad film but it is inferior to its predecessor and that the movie is pleasant for the young audiences, but is not a great entertainment for adult people. \"What this all boils down to is that \"White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf\" is solid entertainment for its intended young audience but offers little for any adult watching it with their kids.\"",
