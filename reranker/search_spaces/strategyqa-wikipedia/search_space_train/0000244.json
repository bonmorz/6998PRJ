Instead of considering the effect of a drug to be the result of one specific drug-protein interaction, systems pharmacology considers the effect of a drug to be the outcome of the network of interactions a drug may have. In 1992, an article on systems medicine and pharmacology was published in China. Networks of interaction may include chemical-protein, protein\u2013protein, genetic, signalling and physiological (at cellular, tissue, organ and whole body levels). Systems pharmacology uses bioinformatics and statistics techniques to integrate and interpret these networks.",

The drug-target network (DTN) can play an important role in understanding the mechanisms of action of approved and experimental drugs. The network theory view of pharmaceuticals is based on the effect of the drug in the interactome, especially the region that the drug target occupies. Combination therapy for a complex disease (polypharmacology) is suggested in this field since one active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) aimed at one target may not effect the entire disease module. The concept of disease modules can be used to aid in drug discovery, drug design, and the development of biomarkers for disease detection. There can be a variety of ways to identifying drugs using network pharmacology; a simple example of this is the \"guilt by association\" method. This states if two diseases are treated by the same drug, a drug that treats one disease may treat the other. Drug repurposing, drug-drug interactions and drug side-effects have also been studied in this field.",

In contrast, pharmacy, a health services profession, is concerned with application of the principles learned from pharmacology in its clinical settings; whether it be in a dispensing or clinical care role.

The only detailed guidelines indicating the requirements from drug regulatory authorities for general pharmacology studies were from the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare.
