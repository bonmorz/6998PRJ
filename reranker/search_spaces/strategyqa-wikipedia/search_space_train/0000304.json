Royce fought against often much larger opponents who were practicing other styles, including boxing, shoot-fighting, muay thai, karate, wrestling, and taekwondo. It has since become a staple art for many MMA fighters and is largely credited for bringing widespread attention to the importance of ground fighting.

Brazilian jiu-jitsu did not follow these changes to judo rules (and there is no evidence that some of the rules were ever used, such as the win by pin/osaekomi or by throw), and this divergence has given it a distinct identity as a grappling art, while still being recognizably related to judo.

The most common injuries Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioners suffer from are ACL tears in the knees, rotator cuff tears in the shoulders and spinal disc herniations, most commonly in the neck region. They are all repairable via surgery that has an extended rehab period before the athlete can return to BJJ training. Also many athletes suffer from less minor injuries, such as elbow and wrist tendonitis, due to overtraining and the grappling nature of the martial art, which can be strenuous and taxing for the joints and the tendons.",
