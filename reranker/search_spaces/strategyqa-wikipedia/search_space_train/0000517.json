What are Samus's aspirations, history, and fears?\" and further stated that \"Nintendo appreciated the questions, but had never thought about them before, and ultimately didn't have a lot of answers\" and at the end, Nintendo \"felt uncomfortable with our team [Hollywood] being the ones to propose those answers\" which basically caused the \"Metroid\" movie project to be ultimately canceled sometime in 2007.
