With the working titles, \"We Live Again\" and \"Turn About\", Howard Hawks purchased an option on Faulkner's short story, \"Turnabout\" of men in combat as a star vehicle for Phillips Holmes, Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers, and later, Clark Gable. Faulkner took only five days to write the film himself, but when Irving Thalberg, the vice-president of MGM studios at the time, insisted that Crawford be written into the script as she was contractually committed to a $500,000 salary, working or not, the first of many rewrites began. Faulkner created the role of Ann, who was involved in a love triangle. Hawks hated the studio interference in what he considered would have been a \"man's picture\", but found working with Crawford was pleasant. Although touted as a classic screen pairing, \"Today We Live\" was the only time Joan Crawford and Gary Cooper performed together. MGM marketed the film as a romance with the trailer focusing on the two stars, gushing on screen with the taglines, \"The fiery head-strong personality of exquisite Joan Crawford\" and \"The calm strength, the eager romantic nature of handsome Gary Cooper.\"",
