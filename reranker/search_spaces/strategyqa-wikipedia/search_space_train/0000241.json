Starting in 139 BCE, the Han diplomat Zhang Qian traveled west in an unsuccessful attempt to secure an alliance with the Da Yuezhi (who were evicted from Gansu by the Xiongnu in 177 BCE); however, Zhang's travels revealed entire countries which the Chinese were unaware of, the remnants of the conquests of Alexander the Great (r. 336\u2013323 BCE). When Zhang returned to China in 125 BCE, he reported on his visits to Dayuan (Fergana), Kangju (Sogdiana), and Daxia (Bactria, formerly the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom which was subjugated by the Da Yuezhi). Zhang described Dayuan and Daxia as agricultural and urban countries like China, and although he did not venture there, described Shendu (the Indus River valley of northern India) and Anxi (Arsacid territories) further west. Envoys sent to these states returned with foreign delegations and lucrative trade caravans; yet even before this, Zhang noted that these countries were importing Chinese silk. After interrogating merchants, Zhang also discovered a southwestern trade route leading through Burma and on to India. The earliest known Roman glassware found in China (but manufactured in the Roman Empire) is a glass bowl found in a Guangzhou tomb dating to the early 1st century BCE and perhaps came from a maritime route passing through the South China Sea. Likewise, imported Chinese silk attire became popular in the Roman Empire by the time of Julius Caesar (100\u201344 BCE).",

He claimed that they recognized the authority of a single leader, who would rule until his death, when a successor would be chosen by vote or through conflict.

According to Caesar, many young men were trained to be druids, during which time they had to learn all the associated lore by heart. He also claimed their main teaching was \"the souls do not perish, but after death pass from one to another\". They were also concerned with \"the stars and their movements, the size of the cosmos and the earth, the world of nature, and the power and might of the immortal gods\", indicating they were involved with not only such common aspects of religion as theology and cosmology, but also astronomy.

The Roman \"Lex Regia\" (royal law), later the \"Lex Caesarea\" (imperial law), of Numa Pompilius (715\u2013673 BC), required the child of a mother dead in childbirth to be cut from her womb. There was a cultural taboo that mothers not be buried pregnant, that may have reflected a way of saving some fetuses. Roman practice requiring a living mother to be in her tenth month of pregnancy before resorting to the procedure, reflecting the knowledge that she could not survive the delivery. Speculation that the Roman dictator Julius Caesar was born by the method now known as C-section is apparently false. Although Caesarean sections were performed in Roman times, no classical source records a mother surviving such a delivery. As late as the 12th century, scholar and physician Maimonides expresses doubt over the possibility of a woman's surviving this procedure and again falling pregnant. The term has also been explained as deriving from the verb \"caedere\", \"to cut\", with children delivered this way referred to as \"caesones\". Pliny the Elder refers to a certain Julius Caesar (an ancestor of the famous Roman statesman) as \"ab utero caeso\", \"cut from the womb\" giving this as an explanation for the cognomen \"Caesar\" which was then carried by his descendants. Nonetheless, even if the etymological hypothesis linking the caesarean section to Julius Caesar is a false etymology, it has been widely believed. For example, the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines Caesarean birth as \"the delivery of a child by cutting through the walls of the abdomen when delivery cannot take place in the natural way, as was done in the case of Julius Caesar\". \"Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\" (11th edition) leaves room for etymological uncertainty with the phrase, \"from the legendary association of such a delivery with the Roman cognomen \"Caesar\"\".",

Julius Caesar intended to start a campaign against the Dacians, due to the support that Burebista gave to Pompey, but was assassinated in 44\u00a0BC. A few months later, Burebista shared the same fate, assassinated by his own noblemen. Another theory suggests that he was killed by Caesar's friends. His powerful state was divided in four and did not become unified again until 95\u00a0AD, under the reign of the Dacian king Decebalus.",

            "document": "Caesar's Comet . Tracing the coinage from 44 BC through the developing rule of Augustus reveals the changing relationship of Julius Caesar to the Sidus Iulium. Robert Gurval notes that the shifting status of Caesar\u2019s comet in the coinage follows a definite pattern. Representations of the deified Julius Caesar as a star appeared relatively quickly, occurring within several years of his death. About twenty years passed, however, before the star completed its transformation into a comet. Starting in 44 BC, a money maker named P. Sepullius Macer created coins with the front displaying Julius Caesar crowned with a wreath and a star behind his head. On the back, Venus, the patron goddess of the Julian family, holds a starred scepter. Gurval maintains that this coin was minted about the time of Caesar\u2019s assassination and thus probably would not have originally referred to his deification. As it circulated, however, it would have brought that idea to mind because of Caesar\u2019s new cult. Kenneth Scott\u2019s older work \"The Sidus Iulium and the Apotheosis of Caesar\" contests this by assuming that the comet did indeed spark this series because of similarity to other coins he produced. A series of Roman aurei and denarii minted after this cult began show Mark Antony and a star, which most likely represents his position as Caesar\u2019s priest. In later coins likely originating near the end of Octavian\u2019s war with Sextus Pompey, the star supplants Caesar\u2019s name and face entirely, clearly representing his divinity.",
