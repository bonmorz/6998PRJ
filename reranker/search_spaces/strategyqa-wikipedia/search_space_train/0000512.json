            "document": "White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf . Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, stating: \"What's best about the film is a kind of fresh-air exuberance, an innocence. The adventures in this movie are fun - not frightening, violent, or depressing. The villains are bad, but not subhuman, and at the end I was positively grateful for a scene where the bad guy tries to get away in a wagon full of gold, with the heroine tied up behind him, and Henry and the dog trying to save her. This was so old-fashioned it was almost daring.\" Rita Kempley from The Washington Post didn't like the film. She praised the animals' performances, but criticized the human actors. \"The animal actors are superb -- you really think White Fang is a goner in a couple of instances -- but the humans have basically reached the level of their own incompetence. Perhaps no one in the cast was able to obey Chief Moses Joseph's injunction to set the inner wolf free. The audience, on the other hand, will surely be howling.\" Lois Alter Mark from Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B rating, concluding that \"White Fang 2\" would be a better film if the filmmakers gave the \"four-legged hero\" more screen time. \"If only White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf had kept the camera on its four-legged hero and let animal trainer Joe Camp (Homeward Bound) work his magic, it too could have been as effective as jujubes in keeping kids glued to their seats.\" Robert Faires from The Austin Chronicle gave the film three out of five stars. He also opined that the movie gets better when the animals are on the screen. \"It's best when the wolves are moving. Maybe when the third one is made -- the final scene screams White Fang: The Next Generation -- they'll leave the humans out of it and just run with the pack.\" \"The Movie Scene\" also gave the film three out of five stars, stating that \"White Fang 2\" is not a bad film but it is inferior to its predecessor and that the movie is pleasant for the young audiences, but is not a great entertainment for adult people. \"What this all boils down to is that \"White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf\" is solid entertainment for its intended young audience but offers little for any adult watching it with their kids.\"",

Generally, a greyhound's career will end between the ages of four and six \u2013 after the dog can no longer race, or possibly when it is no longer competitive. The best dogs are kept for breeding and there are industry-associated adoption groups and rescue groups that work to obtain retired racing greyhounds and place them as pets. In the United Kingdom, according to the BBC, one in four retired greyhounds finds a home as a pet. An UK industry produced report for DEFRA in 2018 showed that actually only 1 in 7 racing greyhounds were not found a home when they retired. In the United States, prior to the formation of adoption groups, over 20,000 retired greyhounds a year were killed; recent estimates still number in the thousands, with the industry claiming that about 90% of National Greyhound Association-registered animals are either adopted or returned for breeding purposes (according to the industry numbers upwards of 2000 dogs are still euthanized annually in the US while anti-racing groups estimate the figure at closer to 12,000.) Other greyhounds are sold to research labs, such as Liverpool university animal training school, who have received the remains of dogs killed at Manchester's Belle Vue stadium. A trainer in Lincolnshire was also exposed offering 'slow' dogs to the Liverpool school. Additionally dogs are sent to foreign racetracks such as Spain and sometimes in developing countries.
