George Selgin, an expert on free banking theory, expounds on value proposition of bitcoin in regard to the inability to control its supply (ie inflation targeting):It doesn\u2019t follow, however, that either Bitcoins\u2019 purchasing power or the volume of Bitcoin-denominated payments will be stable enough to make Bitcoins anyone\u2019s idea of a sound money. Because it makes no allowances for changes in the real demand for Bitcoins, whatever their source, the strict \u201cprotocol\u201d that regulates the supply of Bitcoins\u2014a protocol that raises Bitcoin \u201cmining\u201d costs in response to changes in mining activity and technology, but without regard to Bitcoins\u2019 purchasing power\u2014would allow fluctuations in the pure transactions demand for Bitcoins to continue to influence their purchasing power. As the number approaches 21 million, mining rewards will approach zero, and Bitcoin output with cease once and for all. The transactions demand for Bitcoins will, in contrast, tend to go on increasing with economic growth. A Bitcoin standard would thus tend to result in a rate of deflation at least equal to the rate of economic growth, with occasional bouts of more severe deflation occurring with every cyclical increase in the demand for money. Although (as I\u2019ve argued elsewhere) deflation needn\u2019t go hand-in-hand with recession or depression so long as the rate of deflation reflects an economy\u2019s (total factor) productivity growth rate, chances are that deflation in a Bitcoin economy would frequently exceed this safe limit.Because bitcoin's supply was predetermined at inception and considered unchangeable it cannot fluctuate with the demand cycles and thus Selgin suggests it cannot be made very stable in regard to its purchasing power. However, this still leaves the possibility that bitcoin fits Nash's concept of \"Asymptotically Ideal Money\". Whether Nash was specifically referring to bitcoin or not it still might have the same effect and lead to the intended result of international stability of the existing legacy fiat currencies (and possibly in relation to bitcoin).",

The Louisiana Purchase conveyed to the United States over a million square miles of previously French territory for the price of $15 million. The Purchase was ratified by the U.S. Senate on October 20, 1803, and the new land subsequently doubled the size of the United States and opened the door to a new period of westward expansion. Nearing the one hundred year anniversary of the Purchase in 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt signed a bill which authorized the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, which would become known as the St. Louis World Fair, to celebrate the Purchase and the past years of American history. This included the authorization of the creation of gold one-dollar pieces to be created as commemorative coins. These pieces would go on to be circulated within the American numismatic community after the World Fair in 1904. The Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar was one among many commemorative coins which had been authorized by the United States government since 1892, as centennial anniversaries of important events in early U.S. history were regular occurrences around this time.",

Because it makes no allowances for changes in the real demand for Bitcoins, whatever their source, the strict \u201cprotocol\u201d that regulates the supply of Bitcoins\u2014a protocol that raises Bitcoin \u201cmining\u201d costs in response to changes in mining activity and technology, but without regard to Bitcoins\u2019 purchasing power\u2014would allow fluctuations in the pure transactions demand for Bitcoins to continue to influence their purchasing power. As the number approaches 21 million, mining rewards will approach zero, and Bitcoin output with cease once and for all. The transactions demand for Bitcoins will, in contrast, tend to go on increasing with economic growth. A Bitcoin standard would thus tend to result in a rate of deflation at least equal to the rate of economic growth, with occasional bouts of more severe deflation occurring with every cyclical increase in the demand for money. Although (as I\u2019ve argued elsewhere) deflation needn\u2019t go hand-in-hand with recession or depression so long as the rate of deflation reflects an economy\u2019s (total factor) productivity growth rate, chances are that deflation in a Bitcoin economy would frequently exceed this safe limit.Because bitcoin's supply was predetermined at inception and considered unchangeable it cannot fluctuate with the demand cycles and thus Selgin suggests it cannot be made very stable in regard to its purchasing power. However, this still leaves the possibility that bitcoin fits Nash's concept of \"Asymptotically Ideal Money\". Whether Nash was specifically referring to bitcoin or not it still might have the same effect and lead to the intended result of international stability of the existing legacy fiat currencies (and possibly in relation to bitcoin).",

The United States Senate ratified the treaty on October 20 and President Thomas Jefferson announced the treaty to the American people on July 4, 1803. The area covered by the purchase included much of the present-day United States between the Continental Divide and the Mississippi River, encompassing the Great Plains including part of what is now Montana, particularly the Missouri River drainage. The rights to the Louisiana Purchase territory cost the U.S. $15 million, which came out to an average of 3 cents an acre. On March 10, 1804, a formal ceremony was conducted in St. Louis, Missouri, to transfer ownership of the territory from France to the United States of America. The lands of present-day Montana were practically unknown and too distant from the seats of power for this political boundary change to have much impact upon them, but the Louisiana Purchase would prove a sea-change for the area.",
