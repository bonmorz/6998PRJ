In even-numbered years, any major or minor league club with an expiring PDC may notify Major League Baseball or Minor League Baseball, respectively, of its desire to explore a re-affiliation with a different PDC partner. The Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball offices then send a list of the corresponding major and minor league clubs seeking new affiliations, and there is a limited period of time in September within which clubs may agree upon new PDCs.

The NAPBL became involved in the later stages of the negotiations to develop rules for the acquisition of players from their leagues by the NL and the AL. The 1903 agreement ensured that teams would be compensated for the players that they had taken the time and effort to scout and develop, and no NA team was required to sell their players, although most did because the cash was an important source of revenue for most teams. The NA leagues were still fiercely independent, and the term \"minor\" was seldom used in reference to them, save by the major-market sports writers. Sports news, like most news generally, often did not travel far in the days before radio and television, so, while the leagues often bristled at the major market writers descriptions, they viewed themselves as independent sports businesses. Many baseball writers of that time regarded the greatest players of the minor leagues, such as Buzz Arlett, Jigger Statz, Ike Boone, Buddy Ryan, Earl Rapp and Frank Shellenback, as comparable to major league players. Leagues in the NA would not be truly called minor until Branch Rickey developed the first modern farm system in the 1930s. The Commissioner of Baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis fought Rickey's scheme, but, ultimately, the Great Depression drove teams to establish systems like Rickey's to ensure a steady supply of players, as many NA and independent teams could not afford to keep their doors open without the patronage of Major League Baseball. The leagues of the NA became subordinate to the major leagues, creating the first minor leagues in the current sense of the term. Other than the Pacific Coast League (PCL), which under its president Pants Rowland tried to become a third major league in the Western states, the other leagues maintained autonomy in name only, being totally economically dependent upon the AL and NL.",

The newly relocated Washington Senators club was included in the new roster of franchises in the A.L. as it embarked on a two-year baseball war with the Nationals. By 1903, peace was restored with agreements between the two rival baseball loops on player contract and represented member cities/teams, and the beginnings of a national championship series entitled the World Series. In 1905, the team changed its official name to the Washington Nationals. The name \"Nationals\" would appear on the uniforms for only 2 seasons, and would then be replaced with the \"W\" logo for the next 52 years. The media often shortened the nickname to \"Nats\". Many fans and newspapers (especially out-of-town papers) persisted in continuing using the previous \"Senators\" nickname. Over time, \"Nationals\" faded as a nickname, and \"Senators\" became dominant. Baseball guides would list the club's nickname as \"Nationals or Senators\", acknowledging the dual-nickname situation. After 61 years in the capital, in 1961, the Senators relocated to the upper Midwest to Minnesota and were renamed as the Twins, being the first major league baseball team to use a state in its name rather than the traditional city.",
