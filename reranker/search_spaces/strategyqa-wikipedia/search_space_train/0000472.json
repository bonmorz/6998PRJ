Her debut under the new stage name was also her first time in front of the cameras, as the studio's suspense drama, \"Cry Wolf\", went into national release on August 19, 1947, although it was seen and reviewed in New York one month earlier. Billed third after top-tier stars Errol Flynn and Barbara Stanwyck she received mostly good notices, while the film itself encountered critical resistance, with \"The New York Times\" critic Bosley Crowther complaining that \"[T]he final explanation of the mystery is ridiculous and banal\". Her second film at the studio, \"Possessed\", was released three weeks before \"Cry Wolf\", on July 26, and was, again, reviewed in New York earlier, on May 30. This time, she was in fourth place, behind top-tier stars Joan Crawford and Van Heflin and third-billed Raymond Massey. A much more vulnerable persona than the poised, imperturbable one she played in \"Cry Wolf\", she had a number of heavy dramatic confrontations with the overwrought character played by Joan Crawford (who received an Oscar nomination for the role) and became a lifelong friend of the eighteen-years-older star, and spoke at her memorial service in May 1977, five weeks before her own death. Seeing the young actress for the first time in the latter film, Bosley Crowther described her as \"a newcomer who burns brightly ... as Miss Crawford's sensitive step-daughter\".",
