The Roman legionaries and other forces of the Roman military, until the 2nd century A.D., used the gladius as a short thrusting sword effectively with the \"scutum\", a type of shield, in battle. Gladiators used a shorter gladius than the military. The spatha was a longer double-edged sword initially used only by Celtic soldiers, later incorporated as auxilia into Roman Cavalry units; however by the 2nd century A.D. the spatha was used throughout much of the Roman Empire. The Empire's legionary soldiers were heavily trained and prided themselves on their disciplinary skills. This probably carried over to their training with weaponry, but we have no Roman manuals of swordsmanship. One translation of Juvenal's poetry by Barten Holyday in 1661 makes note that the Roman trainees learned to fight with the wooden wasters before moving on to the use of sharpened steel. In fact, it is also found that Roman gladiators trained with a wooden sword, which was weighted with lead, against a straw man or a wooden pole known as a \"palus\" (an early relative of the later wooden \"pell\"). This training would have provided the Roman soldier with a good foundation of skill, to be improved upon from practical experience or further advanced training.",

Though many swords were double-edged for ease of cutting, this was not always the case. In addition, the geometry of the sword's point varied over time due to changing combat styles, but all were tapered to allow for thrusting. The gladius was also suitable for cutting and chopping. It was mainly used for thrusting, however, and thus had limited effect when wielded from horseback. These swords were made with an iron blade to which a bronze-covered wood, or ivory cross guard, pommel, and grip would be attached. The gladius varied in length and size as Roman soldiers of different ranks used gladius measuring around 34.5 and 64 centimeters. There were other short sword variations that were classified with names other than \"gladius\". One such example is the \"sica\", which was about 40\u00a0cm long and had a curved tip.

Other \"retiarius\" tricks were to whip the net at his opponent's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him. The helmet of the \"secutor\" was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net. In most cases, the \"secutor\" knew to expect the net-man's tactics and tried to intercept and hold on to the weapon, possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net. In such danger, the \"retiarius\" could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger. The \"secutor\" stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it. Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the \"retiarius\" used his net. Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net, yet the class is named for the device, and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a \"retiarius\" in his satires. The discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance, and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict. The lack of nets in \"retiarius\" images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility is that some \"retiarii\" simply did not use nets. In most bouts, the \"retiarius\" probably had to resort to fighting with just his trident and dagger, placing him at a disadvantage. The trident was his primary weapon in such situations, and its length allowed the \"retiarius\" to keep his opponent at bay. He held the weapon two-handed, left nearer the prongs, so that he could parry his enemy's strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends. Wielded two-handed, the weapon could land powerful blows. Images show \"retiarii\" stabbing downward at the \"secutor\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s unshielded legs or stabbing down at the helmet in an attempt to poke through an eyehole. The trident itself was too weak to pierce the metal, although a skull found at Ephesus, Turkey, dating to CE\u00a0200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to the head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent. The \"secutor\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s helmet was rounded and free of protrusions to avoid snaring the net or being caught in the trident's prongs, but attacks on it forced the \"secutor\" to duck or hide behind his shield. This reduced his field of vision and gave the \"retiarius\" an advantage with his speed. Should the \"secutor\" strike with his sword, the \"retiarius\" parried with the trident prongs and attempted to disarm him. Likewise, the more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block the trident with his shield and force the net-man to lose it. Another type of gladiator, scissor could also be pitted against a \"retiarius\". Images from the Eastern Roman Empire show \"scissores\" wearing a tubular arm-guard in lieu of a shield. The guard fits over the left hand and ends in a hooked, knife-like blade that was probably intended to parry the net and trident or to snag and pull away the net. \"Scissores\" who succeeded in this probably dropped the hook weapon and fought with just a sword.",

It is also worth noting that the katana is the weapon highlighted by default on the sword selection screen and that the ninjas all wield katanas.

The German Siegfried joined a gang of bandits after being left by his father, a knight of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, only to unintentionally kill his father during a raid. Driven insane by this act, Siegfried convinced himself that someone else was to blame for his father's death, thus embarking on a journey to find Soul Edge and use it to take revenge. After obtaining Soul Edge, he becomes possessed by the sword and transforms into Nightmare, a major antagonist in the series. Though he does temporarily regain his sanity after the Azure knight is defeated by Kilik and Xianghua in \"Soulcalibur\" (only to be taken over by Soul Edge again shortly after), it is not until after the events of \"Soulcalibur II\" that he is freed from the sword's control entirely and went on to pierce the cursed sword using Soul Calibur, trapped it in \"Soul Embrace\". He spends the duration of the series seeking atonement for the atrocities he committed as Nightmare, who becomes a separate entity by \"Soulcalibur III\" and opposes Siegfried as his archenemy. The two eventually confronted each other in the Lost Cathedral, where Siegfried manages to cast out Soul Edge. However, he is mortally wounded and is left in the brink of death if not for the help offered by Soul Calibur, at which point the holy sword tied itself to Siegfried permanently. Siegfried then makes his way to confront Nightmare, who have \"completed\" itself through its scattered fragments. In their final confrontation, Siegfried successfully destroyed Soul Edge and ended Nightmare's existence. He reformed his gang of bandits, Schwarzwind sometime later, with the intent to find a new wielder for Soul Calibur, as he felt the sword is not loyal to him anymore. After seventeen years, he meets Patroklos Alexander and while at first deprived by his cocky nature, deems him as the new wielder and helps him recover his true fighting style. Siegfried later participates in an all-out war in Hungary, knowing that its leader, Graf Dumas is the new Nightmare.",

Soul Edge was then pierced by Siegfried using Soul Calibur, trapping them in the \"Soul Embrace\".
