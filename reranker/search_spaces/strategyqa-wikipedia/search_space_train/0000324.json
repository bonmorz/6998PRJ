Ballad of Easy Rider is the eighth album by the American rock band the Byrds and was released in November 1969 on Columbia Records (\"see\" 1969 in music). The album was named after the song \"Ballad of Easy Rider\", which had been written by the Byrds' guitarist and singer, Roger McGuinn (with help from Bob Dylan), as the theme song for the 1969 film, \"Easy Rider\". The title was also chosen in an attempt to capitalize on the commercial success of the film, although the majority of the music on the album had no connection with it. Nonetheless, the association with \"Easy Rider\" heightened the Byrds' public profile and resulted in \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" becoming the band's highest charting album for two years in the U.S.",

Recording sessions for \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" were produced by Terry Melcher, who had also worked as the Byrds' producer during 1965, on their \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" albums. The band decided to work with Melcher again as a result of their dissatisfaction with Bob Johnston's production on their previous album, \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\", and on their recent single, \"Lay Lady Lay\". Melcher was happy to accept the band's invitation to produce the album but his one stipulation was that he would also take on management duties for the Byrds, not wishing for a repeat of the conflict he had experienced with Jim Dickson, the group's original manager, in 1965. Melcher's return to the producer's chair began an association with the band that would last until \"Byrdmaniax\" in 1971, much longer than his first tenure as the Byrds' producer. In early 1969, the script writer and leading actor of \"Easy Rider\", Peter Fonda, asked Bob Dylan to compose a theme song for the film. Dylan declined but as a consolation he offered the lines - \"The river flows, it flows to the sea/Wherever that river goes, that's where I want to be/Flow, river, flow\" - which he hurriedly scribbled onto a napkin, before telling Fonda to \"give that to McGuinn.\" The fragment was dutifully passed on to the Byrds' guitarist, Roger McGuinn, who added his own lyrical and musical contributions to fashion a completed song, which he titled \"Ballad of Easy Rider\". After seeing a private screening of \"Easy Rider\" and realizing that he had been named as co-writer of the film's theme song, Dylan demanded that his writing credit be removed, leading McGuinn to theorize in later years that Dylan had disliked the film's ending and anti-hero motif. In 2000 McGuinn recounted to Jud Cost the story of how Dylan disowned credit for the song: \"I got a call from Dylan at three o'clock in the morning going 'What's this? I don't want this credit. Take it off.'\" Another possible reason for Dylan insisting that his name be removed from the song's credits may have been a suspicion that his name was being exploited to boost the film's credibility. Two versions of the song \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" were released. The first was the version included on the \"Easy Rider\" soundtrack album, which was listed as a solo performance by Roger McGuinn, although it also featured fellow Byrd Gene Parsons on harmonica. The second was the recording by the Byrds, which was included on the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album and released as a single. The version of the song found on the soundtrack album and used in the film is a completely different take to the version released by the Byrds.",

Musically the album consolidated and streamlined the band's country rock sound, consisting mostly of cover versions and traditional material, with three self-penned original songs. The first single to be released from the album was the title track, issued in October 1969 in America and reaching number 65 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. Composed primarily by McGuinn, with some input from Bob Dylan (although not credited), \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" was written as the theme tune for the 1969 countercultural film \"Easy Rider\". However the Byrds' recording of the song does not appear in the film, instead an acoustic version credited to McGuinn alone was used. However the Byrds' song \"Wasn't Born to Follow\" from \"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\" album was featured in \"Easy Rider\" and also included on the \"Easy Rider\" soundtrack album in August 1969. The Byrds' association with the film heightened their public profile and when the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album was released in November 1969, it peaked at number 36 in the U.S. and number 41 in the UK, becoming the band's highest charting album for two years in America. A second single taken from the album, \"Jesus Is Just Alright\", was released in December 1969 but it only managed to reach number 97. Despite this lack of commercial success, the Doobie Brothers' later hit version of \"Jesus Is Just Alright\" features an arrangement that was heavily influenced by the Byrds' recording. Just prior to the release of \"Ballad of Easy Rider\", the Byrds underwent yet another change in personnel when bassist John York was asked to leave the band in September 1969. York had become disenchanted with his role in the Byrds and had voiced his reluctance to perform material that had been written and recorded by the group before he had joined. The rest of the band had begun to doubt his commitment and so, a consensus was reached among the other three members that York should be fired. He was replaced, at the suggestion of Parsons and White, by Skip Battin, a freelance session musician and one-time member of the duo Skip & Flip. Battin's recruitment marked the last personnel change to the group for almost three years and as a result, the McGuinn\u2013White\u2013Parsons\u2013Battin line-up became the most stable and longest-lived of any configuration of the Byrds.",

Upon its release, the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album revived the Byrds' commercial fortunes, giving the band their first U.S. Top 40 album since \"Younger Than Yesterday\" in 1967.

Recording sessions for \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" were produced by Terry Melcher, who had also worked as the Byrds' producer during 1965, on their \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" albums. The band decided to work with Melcher again as a result of their dissatisfaction with Bob Johnston's production on their previous album, \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\", and on their recent single, \"Lay Lady Lay\". Melcher was happy to accept the band's invitation to produce the album but his one stipulation was that he would also take on management duties for the Byrds, not wishing for a repeat of the conflict he had experienced with Jim Dickson, the group's original manager, in 1965. Melcher's return to the producer's chair began an association with the band that would last until \"Byrdmaniax\" in 1971, much longer than his first tenure as the Byrds' producer. In early 1969, the script writer and leading actor of \"Easy Rider\", Peter Fonda, asked Bob Dylan to compose a theme song for the film. Dylan declined but as a consolation he offered the lines - \"The river flows, it flows to the sea/Wherever that river goes, that's where I want to be/Flow, river, flow\" - which he hurriedly scribbled onto a napkin, before telling Fonda to \"give that to McGuinn.\" The fragment was dutifully passed on to the Byrds' guitarist, Roger McGuinn, who added his own lyrical and musical contributions to fashion a completed song, which he titled \"Ballad of Easy Rider\". After seeing a private screening of \"Easy Rider\" and realizing that he had been named as co-writer of the film's theme song, Dylan demanded that his writing credit be removed, leading McGuinn to theorize in later years that Dylan had disliked the film's ending and anti-hero motif. In 2000 McGuinn recounted to Jud Cost the story of how Dylan disowned credit for the song: \"I got a call from Dylan at three o'clock in the morning going 'What's this? I don't want this credit. Take it off.'\" Another possible reason for Dylan insisting that his name be removed from the song's credits may have been a suspicion that his name was being exploited to boost the film's credibility. Two versions of the song \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" were released. The first was the version included on the \"Easy Rider\" soundtrack album, which was listed as a solo performance by Roger McGuinn, although it also featured fellow Byrd Gene Parsons on harmonica. The second was the recording by the Byrds, which was included on the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album and released as a single. The version of the song found on the soundtrack album and used in the film is a completely different take to the version released by the Byrds.",

They brought in screenwriter Terry Southern, who came up with the title \"Easy Rider\". The film was mostly shot without a screenplay, with ad-libbed lines, and production started with only the outline and the names of the protagonists. Keeping the Western theme, Wyatt was named after Wyatt Earp and Billy after Billy the Kid. However, Southern disputed that Hopper wrote much of the script. In an interview published in 2016 [Southern died in 1995] he said, \"You know if Den Hopper improvises a dozen lines and six of them survive the cutting room floor he'll put in for screenplay credit. Now it would be almost impossible to exaggerate his contribution to the film\u2014but, by George, he manages to do it every time.\" According to Southern, Fonda was under contract to produce a motorcycle film with A.I.P., which Fonda had agreed to allow Hopper to direct.

He starred with ex-wife Margaret Sullavan in \"The Moon's Our Home\", and a short rekindling of their relationship led to a brief but temporary consideration of remarriage. Fonda got the nod for the lead role in \"You Only Live Once\" (1937), also costarring Sidney, and directed by Fritz Lang. He was a critical success opposite Bette Davis, who had picked him, in the film \"Jezebel\" (1938). This was followed by the title role in \"Young Mr. Lincoln\" (1939), his first collaboration with director John Ford, and that year he played Frank James in \"Jesse James\" (1939). Another 1939 film was \"Drums Along the Mohawk\", also directed by Ford. Fonda's successes led Ford to recruit him to play Tom Joad in the film version of John Steinbeck's novel \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (1940). A reluctant Darryl Zanuck, who preferred Tyrone Power, insisted on Fonda's signing a seven-year contract with his studio, Twentieth Century-Fox. Fonda agreed and was ultimately nominated for an Academy Award for his work in the film, which many consider to be his finest role. Fonda starred in \"The Return of Frank James\" (1940) with Gene Tierney. He then played opposite Barbara Stanwyck in Preston Sturges' \"The Lady Eve\" (1941), and again teamed with Tierney in the successful screwball comedy \"Rings on Her Fingers\" (1942). She was one of Fonda's favorite co-stars, and they appeared in three films together. He was acclaimed for his role in \"The Ox-Bow Incident\" (1943). Fonda enlisted in the United States Navy to fight in World War II, saying, \"I don't want to be in a fake war in a studio.\" Previously, Stewart and he had helped raise funds for the defense of Britain. Fonda served for three years, initially as a Quartermaster 3rd Class on the destroyer . He was later commissioned as a Lieutenant Junior Grade in Air Combat Intelligence in the Central Pacific and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and Navy Presidential Unit Citation.",

The grammarian Apollodorus of Athens argues in his \"Chronicles\" that Plato was born in the first year of the eighty-eighth Olympiad (427 BC), on the seventh day of the month Thargelion; according to this tradition the god Apollo was born this day. According to another biographer of him, Neanthes, Plato was eighty-four years of age at his death. If we accept Neanthes' version, Plato was younger than Isocrates by six years, and therefore he was born in the second year of the 87th Olympiad, the year Pericles died (429 BC). According to the \"Suda,\" Plato was born in Aegina in the 88th Olympiad amid the preliminaries of the Peloponnesian war, and he lived 82 years. Sir Thomas Browne also believes that Plato was born in the 88th Olympiad. Renaissance Platonists celebrated Plato's birth on November 7. Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff estimates that Plato was born when Diotimos was archon eponymous, namely between July 29, 428 BC and July 24, 427 BC. Greek philologist Ioannis Kalitsounakis believes that the philosopher was born on May 26 or 27, 427 BC, while Jonathan Barnes regards 428 BC as year of Plato's birth. For her part, Debra Nails asserts that the philosopher was born in 424/423 BC. According to Seneca Plato died at the age of 81 on the same day he was born.",

Stewart and Fonda would listen to records and invite Johnny Mercer, Hoagy Carmichael, Dinah Shore, and Nat King Cole over for music, with the latter giving the family piano lessons. Fonda played Wyatt Earp in \"My Darling Clementine\" (1946), which was directed by John Ford. Fonda did seven postwar films until his contract with Fox expired, the last being Otto Preminger's \"Daisy Kenyon\" (1947), opposite Joan Crawford. He starred in \"The Fugitive\" (1947), which was the first film of Ford's new production company, Argosy Pictures. In 1948, he appeared in a subsequent Argosy/Ford production, \"Fort Apache\", as a rigid Army colonel, along with John Wayne and Shirley Temple in her first adult role. Refusing another long-term studio contract, Fonda returned to Broadway, wearing his own officer's cap to originate the title role in \"Mister Roberts\", a comedy about the U.S. Navy, during World War II in the South Pacific Ocean where Fonda, a junior officer, Lt. Douglas A. Roberts wages a private war against a tyrannical captain. He won a 1948 Tony Award for the part. Fonda followed that by reprising his performance in the national tour and with successful stage runs in \"Point of No Return\" and \"The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial\". After an eight-year absence from films, he starred in the same role in the 1955 film version of \"Mister Roberts\" with James Cagney, William Powell, and Jack Lemmon, continuing a pattern of bringing his acclaimed stage roles to life on the big screen. On the set of \"Mister Roberts\", Fonda came to blows with director John Ford, who punched him during filming, and Fonda vowed never to work for the director again. While he kept that vow for years, Fonda spoke glowingly of Ford in Peter Bogdanovich's documentary \"Directed by John Ford\" and in a documentary on Ford's career alongside Ford and James Stewart. Fonda refused to participate until he learned that Ford had insisted on casting Fonda as the lead in the film version of \"Mr. Roberts\", reviving Fonda's film career after concentrating on the stage for years.",

Much of \"Easy Rider\"'s significance owes to the fact that it was produced for a respectable, if still modest, budget and released by a major studio. The project was first taken by one of its cocreators, Peter Fonda, to American International. Fonda had become AIP's top star in the Corman\u2013directed \"The Wild Angels\" (1966), a biker movie, and \"The Trip\", as in LSD. The idea Fonda pitched would combine those two proven themes. AIP was intrigued but balked at giving his collaborator, Dennis Hopper\u2014who had appeared in \"The Trip\" and several other AIP opuses\u2014free directorial rein. The duo then took their concept, for which they had projected a $60,000 budget, to producer Bert Schneider. Suggesting that they would have an easier time raising $600,000, Schneider helped arrange a financing and distribution deal with Columbia Pictures, where his brother was president. Two more graduates of the Corman/AIP exploitation mill joined the project: Jack Nicholson and cinematographer L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs. The film (which managed to incorporate another favorite exploitation theme, the redneck menace, as well as a fair amount of nudity) was brought in at a cost of $501,000. \"Easy Rider\" would earn $19.1 million in rentals, becoming, as one history puts it, \"the seminal film that provided the bridge between all the repressed tendencies represented by schlock/kitsch/hack since the dawn of Hollywood and the mainstream cinema of the seventies.\"",
