Henry Corbin, who considers al-Farabi to be a <nowiki>crypto-</nowiki>Shi'ite, says that his ideas should be understood as a \"prophetic philosophy\" instead of being interpreted politically. On the other hand, Charles Butterworth contends that nowhere in his work does al-Farabi speak of a prophet-legislator or revelation (even the word philosophy is scarcely mentioned), and the main discussion that takes place concerns the positions of \"king\" and \"statesmen\". Occupying a middle position is David Reisman, who like Corbin believes that al-Farabi did not want to expound a political doctrine (although he does not go so far to attribute it to Islamic Gnosticism either). He argues that al-Farabi was using different types of society as examples, in the context of an ethical discussion, to show what effect correct or incorrect thinking could have. Lastly, Joshua Parens argues that al-Farabi was slyly asserting that a pan-Islamic society could not be made, by using reason to show how many conditions (such as moral and deliberative virtue) would have to be met, thus leading the reader to conclude that humans are not fit for such a society. Some other authors like Mykhaylo Yakubovych argue that for al-Farabi religion (\"milla\") and philosophy (\"falsafa\") constituted the same praxeological value (i.e. basis for \"amal al-fadhil\"\u2014\"virtuous deed\"), while its epistemological level (\"ilm\"\u2014\"knowledge\") was different.",

During the time of the Umayyad Caliphate, at latest, the scholars of the emerging Islamic society had become familiar with the classical philosophical and scientific traditions of the world they had conquered. The collection of classical works and their translation into the Arabian language initiated a period which is known today as the Islamic Golden Age. According to Hourani (1991), the works of the classical scholars of antiquity were met with considerable intellectual curiosity by Islamic scholars. Hourani quotes al-Kindi (c. 801\u2013873 AD), \"the father of Islamic philosophy\", as follows: \"We should not be ashamed to acknowledge truth from whatever source it comes to us, even if it is brought to us by former generations and foreign peoples. For him who seeks the truth there is nothing of higher value than truth itself.\" The works of Aristotle, in particular his \"Nicomachean Ethics\", had a profound influence on the Islamic scholars of the Golden Age like Al-Farabi (870\u2013950 AD), Abu al-Hassan al-Amiri (d. 992 AD) and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (ca. 980\u20131037 AD). In general, the Islamic philosophers saw no contradiction between philosophy and the religion of Islam. However, according to Hourani, al-Farabi also wrote that philosophy in its pure form was reserved for an intellectual elite, and that ordinary people should rely for guidance on the \"sharia\". The distinction between a scholarly elite and the less educated masses \"was to become a commonplace of Islamic thought\". As exemplified by the works of al-Razi (854\u2013925 AD), during later times, philosophy \"was carried on as a private activity, largely by medical men, pursued with discretion, and often met with suspicion\".",

The exact precedents of Al Farabi's influential philosophical scheme, in which \"nous\" (Arabic \"\u02bfaql\") plays an important role, are no longer perfectly clear because of the great loss of texts in the Middle Ages which he would have had access to. He was apparently innovative in at least some points. He was clearly influenced by the same late classical world as neoplatonism, neopythagoreanism, but exactly how is less clear. Plotinus, Themistius and Alexander of Aphrodisias are generally accepted to have been influences. However while these three all placed the active intellect \"at or near the top of the hierarchy of being\", Al Farabi was clear in making it the lowest ranking in a series of distinct transcendental intelligences. He is the first known person to have done this in a clear way. He was also the first philosopher known to have assumed the existence of a causal hierarchy of celestial spheres, and the incorporeal intelligences parallel to those spheres. Al Farabi also fitted an explanation of prophecy into this scheme, in two levels. According to Davidson (p.\u00a059):The lower of the two levels, labeled specifically as \"prophecy\" (\"nubuwwa\"), is enjoyed by men who have not yet perfected their intellect, whereas the higher, which Alfarabi sometimes specifically names \"revelation\" (\"w-\u1e25-y\"), comes exclusively to those who stand at the stage of acquired intellect. This happens in the imagination (Arabic \"mutakhayyila\"; Greek \"phantasia\"), a faculty of the mind already described by Aristotle, which al Farabi described as serving the rational part of the soul (Arabic \"\u02bfaql\"; Greek \"nous\"). This faculty of imagination stores sense perceptions (\"ma\u1e25s\u016bs\u0101t\"), disassembles or recombines them, creates figurative or symbolic images (\"mu\u1e25\u0101k\u0101t\") of them which then appear in dreams, visualizes present and predicted events in a way different from conscious deliberation (\"rawiyya\"). This is under the influence, according to Al Farabi, of the active intellect. Theoretical truth can only be received by this faculty in a figurative or symbolic form, because the imagination is a physical capability and can not receive theoretical information in a proper abstract form. This rarely comes in a waking state, but more often in dreams. The lower type of prophecy is the best possible for the imaginative faculty, but the higher type of prophecy requires not only a receptive imagination, but also the condition of an \"acquired intellect\", where the human \"nous\" is in \"conjunction\" with the active intellect in the sense of God. Such a prophet is also a philosopher. When a philosopher-prophet has the necessary leadership qualities, he becomes philosopher-king.",

Henry Corbin, who considers al-Farabi to be a <nowiki>crypto-</nowiki>Shi'ite, says that his ideas should be understood as a \"prophetic philosophy\" instead of being interpreted politically. On the other hand, Charles Butterworth contends that nowhere in his work does al-Farabi speak of a prophet-legislator or revelation (even the word philosophy is scarcely mentioned), and the main discussion that takes place concerns the positions of \"king\" and \"statesmen\". Occupying a middle position is David Reisman, who like Corbin believes that al-Farabi did not want to expound a political doctrine (although he does not go so far to attribute it to Islamic Gnosticism either). He argues that al-Farabi was using different types of society as examples, in the context of an ethical discussion, to show what effect correct or incorrect thinking could have. Lastly, Joshua Parens argues that al-Farabi was slyly asserting that a pan-Islamic society could not be made, by using reason to show how many conditions (such as moral and deliberative virtue) would have to be met, thus leading the reader to conclude that humans are not fit for such a society. Some other authors like Mykhaylo Yakubovych argue that for al-Farabi religion (\"milla\") and philosophy (\"falsafa\") constituted the same praxeological value (i.e. basis for \"amal al-fadhil\"\u2014\"virtuous deed\"), while its epistemological level (\"ilm\"\u2014\"knowledge\") was different.",

Al-Farabi compared the philosopher's role in relation to society with a physician in relation to the body; the body's health is affected by the \"balance of its humours\" just as the city is determined by the moral habits of its people.

From al-Muqtadir's reign on, the Abbasids would decline. Yet, at the same time, many names that would become famous in the world of literature and science lived during this and the following reigns. Among the best known are: Ishaq ibn Hunayn (d. 911) (son of Hunayn ibn Ishaq), a physician and translator of Greek philosophical works into Arabic; ibn Fadlan, explorer; al Battani (d. 923), astronomer; Tabari (d. 923), historian and theologian; al-Razi (d. 930), a philosopher who made fundamental and lasting contributions to the fields of medicine and chemistry; al-Farabi (d. 950), chemist and philosopher; Abu Nasr Mansur (d. 1036), mathematician; Alhazen (d. 1040), mathematician; al-Biruni (d. 1048), mathematician, astronomer, physicist; Omar Khayy\u00e1m (d. 1123), poet, mathematician, and astronomer; and Mansur Al-Hallaj, a mystic, writer and teacher of Sufism most famous for his self-proclaimed attainment of unity with God but misunderstood and disputed as divinity, his poetry and for his execution for heresy by Caliph Al-Muqtadir.",

Amongst these are a number of prolegomena to philosophy, commentaries on important Aristotelian works (such as the Nicomachean Ethics) as well as his own works. His ideas are marked by their coherency, despite drawing together of many different philosophical disciplines and traditions. Some other significant influences on his work were the planetary model of Ptolemy and elements of Neo-Platonism, particularly metaphysics and practical (or political) philosophy (which bears more resemblance to Plato's \"Republic\" than Aristotle's \"Politics\").",
