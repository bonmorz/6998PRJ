This question is the root of the median voter theorem and provides the basis for how and why this theorem was created. It starts with the idea of a \"social decision rule.\" Essentially, this is a tool that is used to aggregate preferences of all members of society that, ultimately, provides a clear-cut and consistent answer for what outcome is most preferred. This choice rests on three main principles that allow the most preferred social choice to be salient. The first (1) is Pareto Dominance. This is the idea that if society prefers one choice to all other choices, the social decision should reflect this and this option will be the outcome. The second principle (2) is a concept called transitivity, which is analog to the mathematical property. This phenomenon simply means that if option A is preferred to option B, and option B is preferred to option C, then option A is preferred to option C. The final principle (3) is the idea of independence of irrelevant alternatives. This suggests that if something is not relevant to the election or the issues involved, then it should not affect the outcome or results. For example, imagine there is a vote for the Most Valuable Player in a baseball league and player A has the most votes, player B has the second most and player C has the third most. Now, say, player C is disqualified for cheating - this should not change the outcome of the vote. If the voting system was set up in a way in which aggregate votes are shifted and player B ends up with more votes, this is not a consistent aggregation method.",

Bruce Russell gives two propositions in which the reader decides which one he believes more. Option A: All crows are birds. Option B: All crows are black. If you believe option A, then you are a priori justified in believing it because you don't have to see a crow to know it's a bird. If you believe in option B, then you are posteriori justified to believe it because you have seen many crows therefore knowing they are black.

            "document": "Star Trek: Enterprise (season 4) . The fourth season sought to be different from the previous series of \"Enterprise\" in the way that story arcs worked. In the earlier series there was the ongoing Temporal Cold War plot, with the Xindi attack at the end of the second season resulting in a season long story arc during season three. Instead season four was split up into several smaller arcs which had been planned before the start of the season. The first of these arcs was a resolution to the long running Temporal Cold War, with Braga stating that the intention was \"to resolve [it]... once and for all\". This would also mark the final appearance of the Suliban in \"Enterprise\" as they were tied into that storyline. However, the episodes wrapping up the cold war did not reveal the identity of \"future guy\", the person from the future who was advising the Suliban. Braga explained in a pre-season interview that \"Well, we've been debating that for quite some time, and I'll leave that question open. We haven't decided yet. We have some ideas about him \u2014 or her \u2014 or it. But we haven't settled on any one identity yet. It's still a question mark.\" The identity of \"future guy\" was later revealed by Braga on Twitter as Archer from the future. Brent Spiner returned to the \"Star Trek\" franchise, having previously played the character of Data in \"\". In \"Enterprise\" he played the role of Dr. Arik Soong, an ancestor of Data's creator. Coto compared the character to Hannibal Lecter and talked about the fear that he inspired in the human authorities during the time of \"Enterprise\" due to Soong's actions involving illegal genetics. The storyline involved several references to \"The Original Series\", such as the genetic supermen in the vein of Khan Noonien Singh as first seen in the episode \"Space Seed\" and later in the 1982 film, \"\". The first episode of this \"Enterprise\" story arc also saw the re-appearance of the Orion slave girls as seen in the first pilot of \"Star Trek\", \"\". Coto credited this to his idea for the fourth season saying, \"What I really wanted to do this season is make the episodes that I as a Star Trek fan would have to see. You know, as a fan of the original series, if I heard that they were doing the Orion slavers and the Eugenics Wars, I would have to be in front of that TV.\"",
