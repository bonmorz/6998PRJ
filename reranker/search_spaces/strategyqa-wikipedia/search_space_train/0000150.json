On September 23, 2009, during his opening monologue, O'Brien told a very brief joke about Newark, and a supposed health care program for the city's citizens that would involve Newark giving them a bus ticket out of the city. Newark mayor Cory Booker responded in a satirical YouTube video calling for O'Brien to apologize, and that Conan would be banned from ever entering Newark Liberty International Airport until doing so. Conan responded by further making fun of Newark, however, saying the only way he could get to Newark now would be like everyone else, \"through a series of poor decisions.\" He also called out Cory Booker to come on the show to air out their grievances, deciding to then ban Booker from Burbank airport, adding later that he had absolutely no power to do so. Booker subsequently banned Conan from the state of New Jersey as well as all the sister cities of Newark. In response, O'Brien read a letter on air from Elizabeth, New Jersey mayor Chris Bollwage, declaring that he will temporarily rename Terminal A of Newark Liberty (which lies in Elizabeth) the Conan O'Brien Terminal. Conan continued, saying he had created a \"geographic toilet seat\" around Newark. The mayors of Bayonne, East Orange, Kearny, Jersey City, and Elizabeth have publicly sided with Conan O'Brien. He ended this by saying, \"Your move, Mayor Booker.\" The feud was unofficially ended when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for it to end during a prepared comedy bit, telling Booker to \"chalk it up\" to Conan. The following week Conan announced that Cory Booker would be a guest on the October 16, 2009 show to mend the feud. That night, O'Brien and his wife donated $50,000 to the Newark Now Organization, and NBC Universal matched Conan's donation to total a $100,000 gift. Booker also admitted that he is a big Conan fan and often tapes shows to watch the next day or watches them on the website Hulu.",

O'Brien's successful hosting job at the 2002 54th Primetime Emmy Awards \"sent out the most resounding message yet about his growing strength as a performer\", and a year later, NBC broadcast O'Brien's tenth anniversary special in primetime. By the time Leno's contract again came up for renewal, a discussion would be needed regarding the future of \"The Tonight Show\".

From November 8, 2010 to August 30, 2013, the program aired in Canada on cable channel The Comedy Network on Monday to Thursday nights (Tuesday to Friday mornings) at midnight ET/PT, with a repeat on broadcast network CTV at 1:07\u00a0a.m. local time. The program was only initially announced for CTV, leading to some concern about the unusually late time slot, two hours after its airing in the United States for viewers in the Eastern Time Zone (the program airs on CTV Atlantic at 1:05\u00a0a.m. AT / 12:05\u00a0a.m. ET). This is due to local and national newscasts in the 11:00\u00a0p.m. hour, and CTV's commitments to \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\" at 12:05\u00a0a.m. and \"The Colbert Report\" at 12:35\u00a0a.m. CTV executives later said the program would likely air earlier on The Comedy Network, which is owned by CTV. However, that channel also had a conflict, since it has long aired both \"Daily\" and \"Colbert\" during the 11:00\u00a0p.m. ET hour, simulcasting the Comedy Central feed. The Comedy Network then attempted to move up both programs to 10:00\u00a0p.m. ET beginning in September 2010, presumably to make room for \"Conan\" at 11:00; however, there were intermittent \"technical difficulties\" with getting the shows in time for the earlier airing, particularly for a series of special live \"Daily\" episodes in late October, which meant re-runs were aired in their place. After viewer complaints about the missed episodes, Comedy elected to move both shows back to their previous timeslots, meaning that \"Conan\" was rescheduled on that channel to midnight, on a one-hour delay from TBS. On September 3, 2013, Much Music began broadcasting the program every Monday to Thursday at 11 p.m. ET (8 p.m. Pacific), though it was moved back to its time-delayed midnight airing the following month. The repeat on CTV was moved to 1:37\u00a0a.m. On September 3, 2014, the program began airing on Much at 12:30\u00a0a.m. after \"@midnight\".

For example, a game time between two teams from Pacific Time Zone will still be posted in Eastern time (for example, one may see \"Seattle at Los Angeles\" with \"10:00\u00a0p.m.\" posted as the start time for the game, often without even clarifying the time is posted in Eastern time).",

Another more recent dilemma of the 7:00\u00a0p.m. primetime start is that a combination of longer commutes and work hours than in the past have caused many people to not come home from work until after 7:00\u00a0p.m., cutting into the potential ratings of shows that start at this time. Of course, the reverse is also true since simultaneous broadcasts offer viewers the chance to watch \"prime time television\" without having to stay awake until 11:00\u00a0p.m.",

            "document": "Khonani . \"Khonani\" was written by \"30 Rock\" co-producer Vali Chandrasekaran and directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller, a long-time television director who worked with series creator Tina Fey on the sketch comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\". This episode was Chandrasekaran's second writing credit, having co-written the \"Winter Madness\" episode that aired on January 21, 2010. This was McCarthy-Miller's eleventh directed episode. \"Khonani\" originally aired in the United States on April 22, 2010, on NBC as the eighteenth episode of the show's fourth season and the 76th overall episode of the series. The main plot regarding the two janitors\u2014Subhas and Khonani\u2014battling for the late-night shift at 11:30\u00a0p.m. closely mirrored the feud between television hosts Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien over the hosting job of \"The Tonight Show\". Similar to the feud, in this \"30 Rock\" episode, Khonani signed a contract five years ago to take over the 11:30\u00a0p.m. from Subhas and asked Jack Donaghy to make it happen, which Jack does. In September 2004, it was announced by the NBC network that Jay Leno would be succeeded by Conan O'Brien in 2009 as host of \"The Tonight Show\". Five years later, Leno would host his final episode of \"The Tonight Show\" in May 2009; similarly, Jack informs Subhas that Khonani will take over that shift. Subhas is not thrilled with this, resulting in Jack moving Subhas to the 10:00 shift; O'Brien took over as host of \"The Tonight Show\" in June 2009. NBC, afraid of losing Leno to another network, gave him a new nightly prime time series, \"The Jay Leno Show\", which premiered in September 2009 at 10:00\u00a0p.m. In \"Khonani\", as he begins his shift, Khonani is unhappy as there is no trash to pick up as it already has been collected by Subhas. As a result, Subhas goes back to the 11:30 shift, and Khonani leaves NBC to continue his janitorial duties at Foxwoods Resort Casino. \"The Jay Leno Show\" debuted to good ratings, however, as the show continued it would garner low ratings, resulting in NBC proposing that the show air at 11:35\u00a0p.m. and that \"The Tonight Show\" be moved to 12:05. O'Brien, however, rejected the timeslot. In January 2010, O'Brien reached a deal with the network that would see him leave \"The Tonight Show\" on January 22, 2010, and two months later Leno returned as host of \"The Tonight Show\" on March 1, 2010. In April 2010, O'Brien signed a deal with the cable network TBS to host a new late-night talk show.",

            "document": "The Wizard of Oz on television . Eastern Time (taken from TV Guide and from The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History). The reason that the film did not air in December 1963 has never been stated, but some say that it was because of John F. Kennedy's assassination, others say room needed to be made for more Christmas themed specials and that the movie fit in better during January. For whatever reason, the movie continued to air early in the year rather than late in the year from 1964 until the 1990s. Last airing on CBS until 1976. Moved to NBC in 1968, at this time, the showings were moved from midwinter to late winter/early spring. First showing by NBC, in Spring rather than Winter. The first time that the film was shown at 7:00 P.M instead of 6:00 P.M. The first time that the film aired in the middle of the week, rather than on a weekend. The year that \"The Wizard Of Oz\" returned to CBS. It remained there for twenty-two more years, a likely record in those years for a film's consecutive showings on one network. Initially the movie aired late winter/early spring, but beginning in 1991, the movie moved back and forth from spring to late fall. Another change was that CBS no longer began the movie before normal prime time. Before 1976, when run on a day other than Sunday, NBC took back the 7 p.m. Eastern / 6 p.m. Central time slots from affiliates to run the movie early enough so children could see it before bedtime. Also, prior to 1968, CBS always took the 6 p.m. hour to run the movie early. Logic was that times have changed and children now stay up a little later than they did in the past. From then on, if shown in a Sunday 6 to 8 or 7 to 9 pm time slot on CBS, the film preempted \"60 Minutes\", so beginning in 1978, CBS executives moved the showings to other nights of the week. If the film was shown on a Sunday, CBS usually scheduled it at 8 pm, so that it did not conflict with \"60 Minutes\". (As of 2017, \"60 Minutes\" continues to air in the same Sunday 7 p.m. time slot on CBS.) Delayed due to a CBS News Special report. The last time that the film pre-empted \"60 Minutes\". Soundtrack remastered in stereo using CBS StereoSound system. The first time the film aired twice in the same year. This was done to switch it to a November date. This was the same day that the film \"Twister\", which contains plenty of references to \"The Wizard of Oz\", was released to theatres. The first time that the film aired close to summertime.

O'Brien and his staff were both disappointed and furious; when it became clear O'Brien would not agree to the proposed changes, the situation grew heated. Though not a breach of either host's contract, the change resulted in a public outcry and public demonstrations largely in support of O'Brien. O'Brien's public statement that he would \"not participate in the destruction of \"The Tonight Show\"\" led to negotiations with NBC for a settlement. O'Brien and his staff received US$45 million to walk away from the network, with his final \"Tonight Show\" airing January 22, 2010; Leno was reinstated as host that March, while after a contractual seven-month ban on appearing on television, O'Brien moved to TBS to host \"Conan\".",

The originality and quality of the comedy, however, led by original head writer Robert Smigel, was widely praised. Although O'Brien benefited by comparison from the quick critical and commercial failure of the fellow new late-night \"The Chevy Chase Show\", NBC only offered short-term contracts, 13 weeks at a time and once for six weeks, as widely reported by the press at the time. O'Brien was reportedly almost fired at least once in this period, but NBC had no one to replace him. According to Smigel, \"We were basically canceled at \"Conan\", and then they changed their minds in August of '94, gave us a reprieve.\"",

The late night program lineups on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox are also similarly timeshifted, airing a half-hour later (after a newscast or syndicated programming if the station does not run news programming) but are shifted due to the time zone differences (a bigger issue with first-run late night programs that air after 12:30\u00a0a.m. Eastern Time since the later start time may subject these programs to a potentially decreased audience).
