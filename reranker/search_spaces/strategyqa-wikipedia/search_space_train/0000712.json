The oldest known reference to a Turkic origin is given by the medieval historian Ibn Khallik\u0101n (died in 1282), who in his work Wafay\u0101t (completed in 669/1271) states that Farabi was born in the small village of Wasij near F\u0101r\u0101b (in what is today Otrar, Kazakhstan) of Turkic parents. Based on this account, some modern scholars say he is of Turkic origin. Dimitri Gutas, an American Arabist of Greek origin, criticizes this, saying that Ibn Khallik\u0101n's account is aimed at the earlier historical accounts by Ibn Ab\u012b U\u1e63aibi\u02bfa, and serves the purpose to \"prove\" a Turkic origin for al-Farabi, for instance by mentioning the additional nisba (surname) \"\"al-Turk\"\" (arab. \"the Turk\")\u2014a nisba Farabi never had. However, Abu al-Fed\u0101', who copied Ibn \u1e34hallek\u0101n, corrected this and changed \"al-Tork\u012b\" to the phrase \"wa-k\u0101na rajolan tork\u012byan\", meaning \"he was a Turkish man.\" In this regard, Oxford professor C.E. Bosworth notes that \"great figures [such] as al-Farabi, al-Biruni, and ibn Sina have been attached by over enthusiastic Turkish scholars to their race\".",

Henry Corbin, who considers al-Farabi to be a <nowiki>crypto-</nowiki>Shi'ite, says that his ideas should be understood as a \"prophetic philosophy\" instead of being interpreted politically. On the other hand, Charles Butterworth contends that nowhere in his work does al-Farabi speak of a prophet-legislator or revelation (even the word philosophy is scarcely mentioned), and the main discussion that takes place concerns the positions of \"king\" and \"statesmen\". Occupying a middle position is David Reisman, who like Corbin believes that al-Farabi did not want to expound a political doctrine (although he does not go so far to attribute it to Islamic Gnosticism either). He argues that al-Farabi was using different types of society as examples, in the context of an ethical discussion, to show what effect correct or incorrect thinking could have. Lastly, Joshua Parens argues that al-Farabi was slyly asserting that a pan-Islamic society could not be made, by using reason to show how many conditions (such as moral and deliberative virtue) would have to be met, thus leading the reader to conclude that humans are not fit for such a society. Some other authors like Mykhaylo Yakubovych argue that for al-Farabi religion (\"milla\") and philosophy (\"falsafa\") constituted the same praxeological value (i.e. basis for \"amal al-fadhil\"\u2014\"virtuous deed\"), while its epistemological level (\"ilm\"\u2014\"knowledge\") was different.",

Sogdian has also been suggested as his native language and the language of the inhabitants of F\u0101r\u0101b. Muhammad Javad Mashkoor argues for an Iranian-speaking Central Asian origin.

The oldest known reference to a Turkic origin is given by the medieval historian Ibn Khallik\u0101n (died in 1282), who in his work Wafay\u0101t (completed in 669/1271) states that Farabi was born in the small village of Wasij near F\u0101r\u0101b (in what is today Otrar, Kazakhstan) of Turkic parents. Based on this account, some modern scholars say he is of Turkic origin. Dimitri Gutas, an American Arabist of Greek origin, criticizes this, saying that Ibn Khallik\u0101n's account is aimed at the earlier historical accounts by Ibn Ab\u012b U\u1e63aibi\u02bfa, and serves the purpose to \"prove\" a Turkic origin for al-Farabi, for instance by mentioning the additional nisba (surname) \"\"al-Turk\"\" (arab. \"the Turk\")\u2014a nisba Farabi never had.

Henry Corbin, who considers al-Farabi to be a <nowiki>crypto-</nowiki>Shi'ite, says that his ideas should be understood as a \"prophetic philosophy\" instead of being interpreted politically. On the other hand, Charles Butterworth contends that nowhere in his work does al-Farabi speak of a prophet-legislator or revelation (even the word philosophy is scarcely mentioned), and the main discussion that takes place concerns the positions of \"king\" and \"statesmen\". Occupying a middle position is David Reisman, who like Corbin believes that al-Farabi did not want to expound a political doctrine (although he does not go so far to attribute it to Islamic Gnosticism either). He argues that al-Farabi was using different types of society as examples, in the context of an ethical discussion, to show what effect correct or incorrect thinking could have. Lastly, Joshua Parens argues that al-Farabi was slyly asserting that a pan-Islamic society could not be made, by using reason to show how many conditions (such as moral and deliberative virtue) would have to be met, thus leading the reader to conclude that humans are not fit for such a society. Some other authors like Mykhaylo Yakubovych argue that for al-Farabi religion (\"milla\") and philosophy (\"falsafa\") constituted the same praxeological value (i.e. basis for \"amal al-fadhil\"\u2014\"virtuous deed\"), while its epistemological level (\"ilm\"\u2014\"knowledge\") was different.",

Al-Farabi also wrote a commentary on Aristotle's work, and one of his most notable works is \"Al-Madina al-Fadila\" () where he theorized an ideal state as in Plato's \"The Republic\". Al-Farabi argued that religion rendered truth through symbols and persuasion, and, like Plato, saw it as the duty of the philosopher to provide guidance to the state. Al-Farabi incorporated the Platonic view, drawing a parallel from within the Islamic context, in that he regarded the ideal state to be ruled by the prophet-imam, instead of the philosopher-king envisaged by Plato. Al-Farabi argued that the ideal state was the city-state of Medina when it was governed by the prophet Muhammad as its head of state, as he was in direct communion with Allah whose law was revealed to him.",

            "document": "Shihab dynasty . In 1770, Emir Mansur resigned in favor of Emir Yusuf after being compelled to step down by the Druze sheikhs. The transition was held at the village of Barouk, where the Shihabi emirs, Druze sheikhs and religious leaders met and drew up a petition to the governors of Damascus and Sidon, confirming Emir Yusuf's ascendancy. Emir Mansur's resignation was precipitated by his alliance with Sheikh Zahir al-Umar, the Zaydani strongman of northern Palestine, and Sheikh Nasif al-Nassar of Jabal Amil in their revolt against the Ottoman governors of Syria. Sheikh Zahir and the forces of Ali Bey al-Kabir of Egypt had occupied Damascus, but withdrew after Ali Bey's leading commander, Abu al-Dhahab, who was bribed by the Ottomans. Their defeat by the Ottomans made Emir Mansur a liability to the Druze sheikhs vis-a-vis their relations with the Ottoman authorities, so they decided to depose him. Emir Yusuf cultivated ties with Uthman Pasha and his sons in Tripoli and Sidon, and with their backing, sought to challenge the autonomous power of sheikhs Zahir and Nasif. However, Emir Yusuf experienced a series of major setbacks in his cause in 1771. His ally, Uthman Pasha, was routed in the Battle of Lake Hula by Sheikh Zahir's forces. Afterward, Emir Yusuf's large Druze force from Wadi al-Taym and Chouf was routed by Sheikh Nasif's Shia cavalrymen at Nabatieh. Druze casualties during the battle amounted to some 1,500 killed, a loss similar to that suffered by the Yamani coalition at Ain Dara. Furthermore, the forces of sheikhs Zahir and Nasif captured the town of Sidon after Sheikh Ali Jumblatt withdrew. Emir Yusuf's forces were again routed when they attempt oust sheikhs Zahir and Nasif, who had key backing from the Russian fleet, which bombarded Emir Yusuf's camp.",
