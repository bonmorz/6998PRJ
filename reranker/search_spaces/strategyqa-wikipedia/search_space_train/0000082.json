A general \"melee\" of several, lower-skilled gladiators was far less costly, but also less popular. Even among the \"ordinarii\", match winners might have to fight a new, well-rested opponent, either a \"tertiarius\" (\"third choice gladiator\") by prearrangement; or a \"substitute\" gladiator (\"suppositicius\") who fought at the whim of the \"editor\" as an unadvertised, unexpected \"extra\". This yielded two combats for the cost of three gladiators, rather than four; such contests were prolonged, and in some cases, more bloody. Most were probably of poor quality, but the emperor Caracalla chose to test a notably skilled and successful fighter named Bato against first one \"supposicitius\", whom he beat, and then another, who killed him. At the opposite level of the profession, a gladiator reluctant to confront his opponent might be whipped, or goaded with hot irons, until he engaged through sheer desperation. Combats between experienced, well trained gladiators demonstrated a considerable degree of stagecraft. Among the cognoscenti, bravado and skill in combat were esteemed over mere hacking and bloodshed; some gladiators made their careers and reputation from bloodless victories. Suetonius describes an exceptional \"munus\" by Nero, in which no-one was killed, \"not even \"noxii\" (enemies of the state).\"",

A shotgun is legally defined as a shoulder-mounted firearm that fires shot. Shotguns and shotgun receivers that have never had a buttstock of any type installed are not shotguns, as they cannot be shoulder mounted. Therefore, cutting one of these below the 18\" barrel and/or 26\" overall length cannot produce a SBS as the firearm was never a shotgun. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives recognizes these firearms as being a smooth bore handgun which is an Any Other Weapon (AOW). Unlike an SBS, an AOW only carries a $5.00 tax and can be moved interstate without Federal approval. To maintain its AOW status, it must not have a buttstock (making it a SBS) or a rifled slug barrel (making it a Destructive Device (DD) if the bore is over 0.5\"). Firearms of this type are typically over 100 years old. These weapons produced with a barrel length under 18\" are not considered sawed-off shotguns because they were not produced with a shoulder buttstock. Weapons with these specifications fall under the category of smooth bore handguns produced in heavy rifle calibers and 12/20 gauge shotgun calibers, contrary to illegal sawn-off shotguns and are not considered destructive devices. Any firearms capable of shooting shotgun style cartridges produced after the 18\" minimum barrel restrictions were set into place are considered illegal sawed-off shotguns.",

This probably carried over to their training with weaponry, but we have no Roman manuals of swordsmanship. One translation of Juvenal's poetry by Barten Holyday in 1661 makes note that the Roman trainees learned to fight with the wooden wasters before moving on to the use of sharpened steel. In fact, it is also found that Roman gladiators trained with a wooden sword, which was weighted with lead, against a straw man or a wooden pole known as a \"palus\" (an early relative of the later wooden \"pell\").

Despite the disparity between the nearly nude net-fighter and his heavily armoured adversary, modern re-enactments and experiments show that the \"retiarius\" was by no means outmatched. His lack of heavy equipment meant that he could use speed and evasion to his advantage. He also fought with three offensive weapons to his opponent's one. The net-fighter had to avoid close combat at all costs, keep his distance, and wait for an opening to stab with his trident or throw his net. The name \"secutor\" means \"pursuer\" or \"chaser\", because this gladiator had to chase down the \"retiarius\". They were also known as \"contraretiarii\" (\"those against the net-man\"). The \"secutor\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s strategy was to keep behind his shield (\"scutum\") and force his opponent into close combat so that he could strike with his sword. In close quarters, the net-man had only his \"galerus\" shoulder guard for defence; its design forced him to keep his head ducked down behind it. The \"secutor\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s helmet greatly restricted his sight, hearing, and airflow. Coupled with the heavy weight of his arms and armour\u2014the gear of a \"murmillo\", of which the \"secutor\" was a variant, weighed \u2014this gladiator was in greater danger of exhausting himself in a long fight. One of the \"retiarius\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s tactics was to jab at the \"secutor\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s shield (the heaviest part of his equipment), forcing him to block and wear himself out. Overall, Roman oddsmakers gave an advantage to a \"retiarius\", although skill and experience could affect the odds in individual matches.",

Che Guevara, in his 1961 book \"Guerrilla Warfare\", notes that shotgun ammunition can be obtained by guerrillas even in times of war, and that shotguns loaded with heavy shot are highly effective against unarmored troop transport vehicles. He recommends that suburban guerrilla bands should be armed with easily concealable weapons, such as handguns and a sawed-off shotgun or carbine. Guevara also mentions an improvised weapon developed by guerrillas consisting of a sawed-off 16 gauge shotgun provided with a bipod to hold the barrel at a 45 degree angle. Called the \"M-16\", this was loaded with a blank cartridge formed by removing the shot from a standard shotshell. A wooden rod was then placed in the barrel, with a Molotov cocktail attached to the front. This formed an improvised mortar capable of firing the incendiary device accurately out to a range of 100 meters.",

            "document": "List of Roman gladiator types . The \"retiarius\" (\"net fighter\") developed in the early Augustan period. He carried a trident and a net, equipment styled on that of a fisherman. The \"retiarius\" wore a loincloth held in place by a wide belt and a larger arm guard (\"manica\") extending to the shoulder and left side of the chest. He fought without the protection of a helmet. Occasionally a metal shoulder shield (\"galerus\") was added to protect the neck and lower face. A tombstone found in Romania shows a \"retiarius\" holding a dagger with four spikes (each at the corner of a square guard) instead of the usual bladed dagger. This was previously thought to be an artistic invention or perhaps a ceremonial weapon, but a recent discovery of a gladiator graveyard found that several of the remains had four odd-looking marks that form the outline of a square on their bones which is consistent with the use of such a weapon. A variation to the normal combat was a \"retiarius\" facing two \"secutores\" at the same time. The \"retiarus\" stood on a bridge or raised platform with stairs and had a pile of fist-sized stones to throw at his adversaries. While the \"retiarius\" tried to keep them at bay, the \"secutores\" tried to scale the structure to attack him. The platform, called a \"pons\" (bridge), may have been constructed over water. \"Retiarii\" usually fought \"Secutores\" but sometimes fought \"Myrmillones\". There was an effeminate class of gladiator who fought as a \"retiarius tunicatus\". They wore tunics to distinguish them from the usual \"retiarius\", and were looked on as a social class even lower than infamia.",

            "document": "Riot shotgun . The difference between the riot shotgun and the combat shotgun is blurry, and may be more a matter of application than design. A combat shotgun would be used in military combat situations as a primarily offensive weapon, where a riot shotgun would be used in law enforcement or civilian situations as a primarily defensive weapon. Common additions to a combat shotgun would be provision for attaching a bayonet, and the addition of a ventilated heat shield over the barrel (though this heat shield is a common addition to riot shotguns as well) designed to prevent the operator's fingers from being burned by a barrel heated by multiple shots, and thus to allow the operator to secure a full grip on the weapon while using the attached bayonet, even when the barrel is far too hot to touch (otherwise, there is little reason to enshroud the barrel and hinder the cooling airflow). One or both of these features can be seen on many military long-arms, including the 1903 Springfield, the SMLE, M1 Garand, and Mauser rifles, to name some of the more obvious types. The U.S. Army specifications for shotguns require a metal trigger guard for durability, which reduces the number of \"special purpose\" models used by police that would also be suitable for the military (the Mossberg 590A1 and Benelli M1014 are the standard-issue pump and semi-auto shotguns currently in service; the standard Mossberg 500 and 590 models, and most variants of the Remington 870, have plastic trigger groups).",

Public games were sponsored by leading Romans who wished to advertise their generosity and court popular approval; in the Imperial era, this usually meant the emperor. Several venues were developed specifically for public games. The Colisseum was built in the Imperial era to host, among other events, gladiatorial combats. These combats had begun as funeral games around the 4th century BC, and became popular spectator events in the late Republic and Empire. Gladiators had an exotic and inventive variety of arms and armour. They sometimes fought to the death, but more often to an adjudicated victory, dependent on a referee's decision. The outcome was usually in keeping with the mood of the watching crowd. Shows of exotic animals were popular in their own right; but sometimes animals were pitted against human beings, either armed professionals or unarmed criminals who had been condemned to a spectacular and theatrical public death in the arena. Some of these encounters were based on episodes from Roman or Greek mythology.",
