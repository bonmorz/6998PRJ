In March 1973, following the completion of his album \"Living in the Material World\", Harrison offered \"Sunshine Life for Me\" to Starr for inclusion on the latter's first rock solo album, \"Ringo\". The main sessions for \"Ringo\" took place in Los Angeles that same month and coincided with a spirit of reconciliation among all the former Beatles, after Harrison, Starr and Lennon had grown disaffected with Klein as a manager. In addition to \"Sunshine Life for Me\" and individual contributions from Lennon and McCartney, Starr received co-writing assistance from Harrison on \"Photograph\", which became Starr's first number 1 hit on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart when released as the album's advance single. With Richard Perry as his producer, Starr recorded the basic track for \"Sunshine Life for Me\" at Sunset Sound Recorders in early March. He later referred to \"Ringo\" as his \"accidental album\", since the project was planned at the last minute, and many of his collaborators were in Los Angeles for other reasons. In the case of the musicians on \"Sunshine Life for Me\", Harrison was there primarily to join Starr and Lennon for business meetings at Capitol Records before producing Ravi Shankar's \"Shankar Family & Friends\" album, while the Band were in Los Angeles to record \"Moondog Matinee\". The line-up on the track included four members of the Band Levon Helm (on mandolin), Robbie Robertson (guitar), Rick Danko (fiddle) and Garth Hudson (accordion) and multi-instrumentalist David Bromberg (on banjo and fiddle). A friend of the Beatles since their years in Hamburg, Klaus Voormann played upright bass. Pop culture author Robert Rodriguez describes \"Sunshine Life for Me\" as a song \"custom-crafted\" for Starr, who had previously demonstrated an affiliation for country music in his White Album composition \"Don't Pass Me By\" and in his 1970 country album \"Beaucoups of Blues\", which he recorded in Nashville with producer Pete Drake. Harrison recalls in \"I, Me, Mine\" that it was \"a fun session and a good track\". Both avowed fans of the group since the late 1960s, Starr and Harrison recorded with the Band for the first time on \"Sunshine Life for Me\".

Overdubbing on the songs recorded for \"Ringo\", including Starr's lead vocals, took place at Sunset Sound and other studios in Los Angeles from late March to July 1973. The other vocal parts on \"Sunshine Life for Me\" were sung by Harrison and Vini Poncia, Starr's regular songwriting partner during much of the 1970s. Leng highlights these multiple harmonies as both a \"shared inheritance\" of the Beatles and the Band, and a precursor to Harrison's later work with the Traveling Wilburys. Apple Records issued \"Ringo\" on 2 November 1973. The release coincided with Lennon, Harrison and Starr suing Klein in the High Court in London for payment of funds owed to the Beatles and for misrepresenting their interests. \"Sunshine Life for Me (Sail Away Raymond)\" was sequenced as the fourth track on the album, between \"Photograph\" and \"You're Sixteen\". In his book \"The Beatles Solo on Apple Records\", Bruce Spizer describes the first five tracks on \"Ringo\" as \"one of the strongest album sides produced by any ex-Beatle\". The album cover consisted of a painting by Tim Bruckner in which Harrison, the four members of the Band and all the other musicians on the recording appear, alongside Starr. The song was published by the Material World Charitable Foundation, which Harrison had set up in April 1973.",
