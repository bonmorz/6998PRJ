Collections prior to Terry's (except for Davis and Tozer's much earlier and contrived-sounding settings) had not provided enough verses to create \"full\" songs, and it is unlikely that performers would venture to improvise new verses in the manner of traditional shantymen. By 1926, it had become a custom at the Seven Seas Club in London to hold a shanty sing-along after the club's monthly dinners. By 1928, commercial recordings of shanties, performed in the manner of classical concert singing, had been released on HMV, Vocalion, Parlophone, Edison, Aco, and Columbia labels; many were realizations of scores from Terry's collection.

Since different songs were useful for different tasks they are traditionally divided into three main categories, short haul shanties, for tasks requiring quick pulls over a relatively short time; halyard shanties, for heavier work requiring more set-up time between pulls; and Capstan shanties, for long, repetitive tasks requiring a sustained rhythm, but not involving working the lines. Famous shanties include, the 'Drunken Sailor' and 'Blow the Man Down'. There was some interest in sea shanties in the first revival from figures like Percy Grainger. In the second revival A. L.

Somewhere between these perspectives was Cecil Sharp's, whose \"English Folk-Chanteys\" (1914) was published in the same year, and was based on shanties he collected from aged English sailors in Britain. Sharp responds to Bullen's claims of African-American origins by ceding that many shanties were influenced through the singing of Black shantymen\u2014a position that assumes English folk song was the core of the tradition by default. The title of Sharp's work reflects his project of collecting and grouping shanties as part of what he conceived to be a rather continuous English folk song tradition. Sharp states in the introduction that he deliberately excluded shanties which were obviously (i.e. to him) born of popular songs. This idea is problematic when one considers that the popular songs that were feeding shanties were largely American and based in real or imagined African-American musical traits. However, Sharp believed that by eliminating such shanties based on popular songs, he could concentrate those that were \"folk\" songs. Of his own admission, Sharp lacked any shantying or sea experience to intuitively judge shanties like someone such as Bullen, however he offers his objectivity, recording precisely what was sung to him, as consolation. While Sharp's manner of documenting shanties was more or less objective, the field of his research and his biases in what to collect certainly influenced the outcome of this study. And whereas Bullen's work was fairly inaccessible, Sharp was influential as the leader of a cohort of scholars who were actively creating the young field of folk song research.",

The American folk revival group The Almanac Singers were recruited by Alan Lomax to record several shanties for the 1941 album Deep Sea Chanteys and Whaling Ballads. In Britain, the incorporation of shanties into the folk revival repertoire was largely led by A.L. Lloyd starting in the 1950s. An amateur folklorist, Lloyd discarded the earlier classical style of presentations in favor of a more \"authentic\" performance style. He was generally mysterious about the sources of his shanty arrangements; he obviously referred to collections by editors like Sharp, Colcord, and Doerflinger, however it is often unclear when and whether his versions were based in field experience or his private invention. Lloyd's album \"The Singing Sailor\" (1955) with Ewan MacColl was an early milestone, which made an impression on Stan Hugill when he was preparing his 1961 collection, particularly as the performance style it embodied was considered more appropriate than that of earlier commercial recordings. Many other performers followed, creating influential versions and interpretations of shanties that persist today. For example, Lloyd's personal interpretation of \"South Australia\" was taken up by the Irish folk revival group The Clancy Brothers, from which this version spread to countless folk performers to become established as the \"standard\" form of what is usually presented as a \"traditional\" shanty. Through the mass distribution of particular shanty forms through recordings and clubs, the Folk Revival has had the effect of creating an impression of rather consistent forms of texts and tunes\u2014a sharp contrast to the highly variable and often improvised nature of work-based shanty singing. Another effect, due to the fact that most folk performers sang shanties along with other genres, is that shanty repertoire was ever more incorporated within the generic fold of \"folk song,\" and their distinctive use, manner of performance, and identity were co-opted.",

One of the earliest references to shanty-like songs that has been discovered was made by an anonymous \"steerage passenger\" in a log of a voyage of an East India Company ship, entitled \"The Quid\" (1832).

While this practice was analogous to the practice of what is later called singing \"capstan shanties,\" the form of these verses is not particularly similar to later shanties. These songs do not appear to correspond to any shanty known from later eras. It is possible that the long, monotonous task of heaving the capstan had long inspired the singing of time-passing songs of various sorts, such as those in \"The Quid\". For example, the composition of capstan-style \"sailor songs\" by Norwegian poet Henrik Wergeland as early as 1838 implies that Scandinavians also used such songs.

This was a time when there was relative peace on the seas and shipping was flourishing. The United States had come to the fore as a maritime leader, especially due to the nation's design of packet ships. These ships carried cargo and passengers on fixed schedules, largely operating across the Atlantic. Packet ships were larger and yet sailed with fewer crew than vessels of earlier eras, in addition to the fact that they were expected on strict schedules. These requirements called for an efficient and disciplined use of human labor. American vessels, especially, gained reputations for cruelty as officers demanded high results from their crew. The shanties of the 19th century could be characterized as a sort of new \"technology\" adopted by sailors to adapt to this way of shipboard life.",

            "document": "Work song . Work songs sung by sailors between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries are known as sea shanties. These songs were typically performed while adjusting the rigging, raising anchor, and other tasks where men would need to pull in rhythm. These songs usually have a very punctuated rhythm precisely for this reason, along with a \"call-and-answer\" format. Well before the nineteenth century, sea songs were common on rowing vessels. Such songs were also very rhythmic in order to keep the rowers together. Because many cultures used slaves to row, some of these songs might also be considered slave songs. Improvised verses sung by sailors spoke of ills with work conditions and captains. These songs were performed with and without the aid of a drum.",

A reference to what seems to be a sailor's hauling chant in \"The Complaynt of Scotland\" (1549) is a popularly cited example. Liberal use of the word \"shanty\" by folklorists of the 20th century expanded the term's conceptual scope to include \"sea-related work songs\" in general. However, the shanty genre is distinct among various global work song phenomena. Its formal characteristics, specific manner of use, and repertoire cohere to form a picture of a work song genre that emerged in the Atlantic merchant trade of the early 19th century. As original work songs, shanties flourished during a period of about fifty years.",

            "document": "W. B. Whall . Nearing retirement, Whall recalled the sea songs of his youth, combining them perhaps with songs from sailors he had met in the Liverpool and Bristol areas in his latter years. At first he published a selection of songs in the \"Nautical Magazine\" and in \"Yachting Monthly\" but then resolved to compile them all in a single book, writing: \"I set myself a plain task, namely to write down these songs, music and words, as I heard them sung at sea by sailors.\" He enrolled the help of his younger brother Roughton Henry Whall (1862\u20131933), an organist and music teacher (Mus. Bac., FRCO) living in Stroud, Glos as well as his niece Veronica Whall (b1885), the young daughter of another brother Christopher Whall, a stained glass artist in Dorking. Roughton Whall supplied the musical settings and Veronica Whall the illustrations for the book, which came out in 1910 and quickly went through several editions. It contained 50 songs, half of which would find their way into most modern shanty books or repertoires.  Whall's book preceded the collection of another genuine seafarer Frank Thomas Bullen (1857\u20131915). Bullen went to sea in 1869 aged 12 and later became a prolific novelist. At the end of his life he set out 42 shanties in his interesting book. Whall also preceded the folksong collector Cecil Sharp, who picked up shanties from Somerset singers Henry Rapsey and Henry Bailey in Bridgwater as well as a massive store of songs from John Short ('Yankee Jack') at Watchet. Sharp's book \"English Folk-Chanteys\" came out in 1914. Collections of French shanties were made by Captain Armand Hayet in 1927 and American songs by Joanna Carver Colcord in 1924. Many modern scholars, however, still reference Capt Whall's book in their investigations into sea songs and shanties. Richard Runciman Terry in his book \"The Shanty Book Part One\" comments that 'of all these collections (of shanties) Capt. Whall's is the only one which a sailor could accept as authoritative'.",
