In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling. If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity. If, after a game is over, a ruling change is made that would have significantly altered the outcome of the game, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show.",

The host gives the first words of a fictitious proverb. Each player has to finish the proverb with his/her own words. The host asks the meaning of a real abbreviation or acronym, but each player has his/her own interpretation. The host asks the player to finish a sentence beginning with: \"Bless (a famous person or a group of famous people)...\" Each player is assigned with a different statement. The players have to read their statement, but they have to change a selected letter by another one. Example: change the \"b\" for \"z.\" Each player has 30 seconds to read their statement.  The host asks the players what is the difference between two famous people. A different sound is assigned to each humorist. They have to tell what it does mean. The host gives a fictitious scenario: a famous person has gone to a selected place. Each player has to imagine what this person did there. The host gives the beginning of a sentence which begins itself with the word \"if.\" Each player is asked to finish the sentence. That game is played with a drawing board. Each humorist is shown a different abstract drawing. They all have to finish their drawing their own way and to explain the significance of the final drawing. A guest star invited to the show is hidden behind a big board. The host gives clues to the players in order to discover the guest's identity. This is a game based on improvisation. Each player is secretly given a person, an animal or an event by the host. The player has to mime it and the other two players have to guess what the active player wants to tell them. A guest star invited to the show is hidden in a hot pepper costume. The players have to ask questions to the hidden guest in order to discover his/her identity.

Each player is given limited time and if he/she passes through his/her own time, it's another player turn to try. The most popular game of the show. Each humorist tells a joke or a hilarious story of his/her choice. The host asks the players to tell what they think is the biggest secret kept by a famous person. The host gives the beginning and the end of a fictitious story. Each part is completely different from the other. Player 1 has to tell the story by saying the beginning words already given and to go on with his/her own ideas during a given time. Then, player 2 has to pursue the story where player 1 left off.

The most well-known of these catchphrases is the host's question \"Is that your final answer?\", asked whenever a contestant's answer needs to be verified. The question is asked because the rules require that the contestants must clearly indicate their choices before they are made official, the nature of the game allowing them to ponder the options before committing to an answer. Regularly on tier-three questions, a dramatic pause occurs between the contestant's statement of their answer and the host's acknowledgement of whether or not it is correct.",
