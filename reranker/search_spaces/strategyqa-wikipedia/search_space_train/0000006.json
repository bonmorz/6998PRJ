A further ambiguity with yes\u2013no questions, in addition to that of polarity, is the ambiguity of whether an \"exclusive\" or \"inclusive\" disjunction is meant by the word \"or\", as it can represent either. Conventionally, in English yes\u2013no questions the \"or\" represents an exclusive disjunction. However, as with the \"Would you like an apple or an orange?\" question mentioned earlier, to which one possible answer, as a yes\u2013no question, is \"yes.\", yes\u2013no questions can also be taken to be \"inclusive\" disjunctions. The informativeness of the \"or\" in the question is low, especially if the second alternative in the question is \"something\" or \"things\". The \"exclusive\" and \"inclusive\" can be determined often in spoken language (the speaker will often lower their pitch at the end of an \"exclusive\" question, as opposed to raising it at the end of an \"inclusive\" question), but it is a frequent source of humour for computer scientists and others familiar with Boolean logic, who will give responses such as \"yes\" to questions such as \"Would you like chicken or roast beef for dinner?\". However, the ambiguity is not confined to humour. The apple-or-orange question may be legitimately asking whether either is wanted, for example, and \"Would you like an apple or something?\" is indeed \"expecting\" either \"yes\" or \"no\" as a proper answer rather than the answer \"Something\" that an exclusive disjunction would be requesting.",

In humans, it is defined as a body core temperature below . Symptoms depend on the temperature. In mild hypothermia there is shivering and mental confusion. In moderate hypothermia shivering stops and confusion increases. In severe hypothermia, there may be paradoxical undressing, in which a person removes his or her clothing, as well as an increased risk of the heart stopping. Hypothermia has two main types of causes. It classically occurs from exposure to extreme cold. It may also occur from any condition that decreases heat production or increases heat loss. Commonly this includes alcohol intoxication but may also include low blood sugar, anorexia, and advanced age. Body temperature is usually maintained near a constant level of through thermoregulation. Efforts to increase body temperature involve shivering, increased voluntary activity, and putting on warmer clothing. Hypothermia may be diagnosed based on either a person's symptoms in the presence of risk factors or by measuring a person's core temperature. The treatment of mild hypothermia involves warm drinks, warm clothing, and physical activity. In those with moderate hypothermia, heating blankets and warmed intravenous fluids are recommended. People with moderate or severe hypothermia should be moved gently. In severe hypothermia, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass may be useful. In those without a pulse, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is indicated along with the above measures. Rewarming is typically continued until a person's temperature is greater than . If there is no improvement at this point or the blood potassium level is greater than 12\u00a0mmol/liter at any time, resuscitation may be discontinued. Hypothermia is the cause of at least 1,500 deaths a year in the United States. It is more common in older people and males. One of the lowest documented body temperatures from which someone with accidental hypothermia has survived is in a near-drowning of a 7-year-old girl in Sweden. Survival after more than six hours of CPR has been described. For those for whom ECMO or bypass is used, survival is around 50%. Deaths due to hypothermia have played an important role in many wars. The term is from Greek \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf, \"ypo\", meaning \"under\", and \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1, \"therm\u00eda\", meaning \"heat\".

Because of its location in the interior United States, Missouri often experiences extremes in temperatures. Lacking either large mountains or oceans nearby to moderate its temperature, its climate is alternately influenced by air from the cold Arctic and the hot and humid Gulf of Mexico. As of late, Missouri has seen a drastic decline in annual snowfall, with some daily high winter temperatures sometimes dwindling in early summer/late spring temperatures.",

Eastern Oklahoma has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfa\") heavily influenced by southerly winds bringing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and has hot, humid summers and generally mild winters, but with sometimes-dramatic cold spells, sometimes accompanied by snow, sleet or freezing rain. This transitions progressively to a semi-arid zone (K\u00f6ppen \"BSk\") in the high plains of the Panhandle, where a drier climate prevails, with somewhat-colder winters and similarly-hot summers but much lower humidity. Other central to western areas of the state, including Lawton and Enid in the transition zone, are also less affected by moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. They also tend to be drier than Oklahoma's eastern counties. Precipitation and temperatures fall from east to west accordingly, with areas in the southeast averaging an annual temperature of 62\u00a0\u00b0F (17\u00a0\u00b0C) and an annual rainfall of over 40 and as high as , while areas of the panhandle average 58\u00a0\u00b0F (14\u00a0\u00b0C), with an annual rainfall under .

The state is home to the National Storm Prediction Center of the National Weather Service located in Norman. Winter and spring weather often are influenced by the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation. Winters during El Ni\u00f1o are cooler than average and wetter across the western portion of the state due to an amplified southern jet stream. During La Ni\u00f1a, the storm track is further north, therefore winters are warmer than average and drier in the western part of the state.",

Consequently, it has China's lowest sunshine totals. The western region has mountainous areas producing a cooler but sunnier climate.
