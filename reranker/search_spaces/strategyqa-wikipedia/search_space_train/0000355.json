The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France.

Directly the train had passed, every one was alive. Each inspector had four gangs of five and twenty men in his mile. Two of the twenty five went ahead knocking out the fastening, two pairs followed cutting the transoms which had already been marked, and two more followed the main gang refixing the bolts and straps. By midnight the line on our two miles had been slewed in from 7 feet 0 1/4 inches to the 4 feet 8 1/2 inches gauge, and we retired to our hut to feed and, as we hoped, to sleep.

I then walked towards Twyford, where progress had been slower, as the line was curved and the rails had to be cut in many places.

An important element in the Neoplatonic answer to these questions is its reaction to Scepticism. In response to the sceptical position that we only know the appearances presented by our senses, and not the world as it is, Plotinus placed the object of knowledge inside the soul itself, and accounted for this interior truth through the soul's kinship with its own productive principles.",

Also, assume we always choose the fastest for the solo-cross. First, we show that if the two slowest persons (C and D) cross separately, they accumulate a total crossing time of 15. This is done by taking persons A, C, & D: C+A+B+A = 8+1+5+1=15. (Here we use A because we know that using A to cross both C and D separately is the most efficient.) But, the time has elapsed and person A and B are still on the starting side of the bridge and must cross. So it is not possible for the two slowest (C & D) to cross separately. Second, we show that in order for C and D to cross together that they need to cross on the second pair-cross: i.e. not C or D, so A and B, must cross together first. Remember our assumption at the beginning states that we should minimize crosses and so we have five crosses - 3 pair-crossings and 2 single crossings. Assume that C and D cross first. But then C or D must cross back to bring the torch to the other side, and so whoever solo-crossed must cross again. Hence, they will cross separately. Also, it is impossible for them to cross together last, since this implies that one of them must have crossed previously, otherwise there would be three persons total on the start side. So, since there are only three choices for the pair-crossings and C and D cannot cross first or last, they must cross together on the second, or middle, pair-crossing. Putting all this together, A and B must cross first, since we know C and D cannot and we are minimizing crossings. Then, A must cross next, since we assume we should choose the fastest to make the solo-cross. Then we are at the second, or middle, pair-crossing so C and D must go. Then we choose to send the fastest back, which is B. A and B are now on the start side and must cross for the last pair-crossing. This gives us, B+A+D+B+B = 2+1+8+2+2 = 15.",

The veneration of the feet of gurus or deities was commonplace in ancient India, placing one's head at or under their feet being a ritual gesture declaring a hierarchy. As \"cetiya\", the Buddha's footprint was classified in a variety of ways. Some were \"uddesika\", representational relics, and others were \"paribhogika\", relics of use or of contact, and occasionally \"saririka\", as though they were not just footprints but the Buddha's actual feet. Some of the depictions of the footprints may signify events in the life of the Buddha, but others may have been depictions of people worshipping at footprint shrines.  To clarify: a footprint of the Buddha is a concave image of his foot (or feet), supposed to have been left by him on earth to purposefully mark his passage over a particular spot. The images of the Buddha\u2019s feet are convex images which represent the actual soles of his feet, with all their characteristics. Following the traditional triple division of the \"cetiya\", we can assume that the first form of the image of the Buddha\u2019s feet \u2013 the concave one \u2013 is a sort of \"p\u0101ribhogika\" element, since it is indissolubly connected with the Tath\u0101gata himself.

But we can think of this second group, too, as a \u201c\"p\u0101ribhogika\" by supposition\u201d, as accurately noted by Chutiwongs.

He even threatened with execution those who would not come under his flag. We know about two armies which gathered: one, consisting of Swabian and other forces from southern Germany, led nominally by the king Louis the Child (but because of his young age, in reality the leader of this army were Gozbert count of Alemannia and Managolt the count of Ladengau in Franconia), and the other, consisting from troops gathered from Franconia, Lotharingia (presuming that if the duke of Lotharingia led the army, he gad to bring with him also an important troop from his country), Bavaria and maibe Saxony (however we do not know anything about the Saxons taking part of this battle, but we presume that they also heard the call and the threat of king Louis, and that maybe they want to put an end of the Hungarian attacks, because they suffered in 906 and 908 two devastating attacks from the Hungarian armies), led by Gebhard, Duke of Lorraine and Liudger, the count of Ladengau. These two armies tried to unite, and fight the Hungarians together. The Hungarians learned about plans of Louis the Child, and sent quickly a Hungarian army, which rushed to prevent the joining of the Swabian and Frankish forces. They reached Augsburg on forced march very quickly, totally unexpected for Louis the Child and his army, and, at 12 June 910, defeated in the battle of Augsburg the army of the King. Maybe the failure of the Frankish army to arrive at the battle scene was due to some Hungarian units, which \"kept busy\" the Franco-Lotharingian army, distracting the attention of its leaders from the other battle, the Battle of Augsburg. So, the Hungarian army, with a \"Napoleonean\" tactic (Istv\u00e1n B\u00f3na), cleverly managed to attack, and deal with these two armies separatedly. After that first battle, the Hungarian army marched north, to the border of Bavaria and Franconia, and met with the Franco-Bavaro-Lotharingian army led by Gebhard, Duke of Lorraine at Rednitz. We do not know who led the Hungarians, but it seem to be a military leader, and not the Grand Prince of the Hungarians, who in the 9th-10th centuries never took place in a battle outside of the Hungarian territories, the campaigns being led by more minor military leaders, the horka or one of the princes. We do not know about the strength of the two armies before the battle, but knowing the fact that at least three (Franconia, Lotharingia, Bavaria) if not four (Saxonia) East Francian duchies took part in the battle, and the army was led by a duke and a count, we can presume that the German army was bigger than the Hungarians, who before this battle had to fight another battle at Augsburg with the Swabian army of the German king Louis the Child, which, although was a victory, could cause them some losses too. Like in the before mentioned battle, in this battle too, met two war philosophies, styles and type of fighting, and weapons: the medieval European, inspired by the European-Frankish style of war and strategical thinking (consisting in heavy armours and weapons, the prevail of the strongest army without putting much importance on strategy), used by the Germans and the Nomadic War tactics, strategy and weapons used by the Hungarians (using exclusively cavalry, light or no armor, predominance of the bows and arrows, high mobility of the army corps, and predominance of delusive war tactics, which needed strategical thinking from the commanders).",

            "document": "Edward Broughton . \"The first man we murdered was Hutchinson, we were nearly starving at the time, and we drew lots who should kill him; Hutchinson was asleep: the lot fell upon me, and I killed him with an axe, which we brought with us. He was cut to pieces, and with the exception of the intestines, hands, feet and head, the body was carried with us. We lived somedays on his flesh; we ate it heartily- I do not know how many days it lasted. After having thus committed murder, we began to be afraid of each other; one night I awoke Fagan, and told him to watch while I slept, and I would watch while he slept, for I feared that I should be murdered; we each of us feared, that on going to sleep we should be dispatched by the others. One night, as Coventry was cutting wood, we other three agreed to kill him; he was an old man of nearly sixty. I refused to do it as I said they ought to kill him among them, so we might all be in the same trouble. Fagan struck the old man the first blow with the axe; Coventry saw him coming, and cried out for mercy; he struck him just above the eye, but did not kill him - Macavoy and myself finished him and cut him in pieces. We lived upon his body for some days; we were not starving when we killed Coventry' we had only consumed the remains of Hutchinson the same day. We were not at all sparring of the food we obtained from the bodies of our companions: we eat it as if we had abundance-if we had been sparing of it, the one would have been sufficient for us. We now became daily more afraid of each other. Before we had consumed Coventry's body, Macavoy one night started up from the fire, and asked me to go down with him into the bush to see if we could find a kangaroo track, that we might set a snare for. When leaving the fire, Macavoy said, \"Bring the axe with you.\" When we had gone about 300 yards, Macavoy laid down and asked me to stop and sit down. I was afraid; I thought he wanted to take away my life, and he was stronger than me. I then threw the axe further from him than from myself, so that if he attempted to take it, I thought I could get it before him. He did not offer to touch it, he then said, \"there are three of us, Fagan is young and foolish, people will frighten him; and he will tell what has been done, now the only thing that we can do to pre- vent it is to kill him.\"' I said l would not agree to it, that I knew him better than he did, and was acquainted with his ways and that he would not tell. I could trust my life in his hands. Macavoy said that he was sure he would tell, he would be frightened, as there was three of us, he would turn evidence as to these murders, to save his own life, and we should be hanged ; when there are only you and I together, we could not turn evidence against each other, we can say that we left them at Gordon's River, at the back of the Frenchman's Cap, because they could not swim over it, and then it would be supposed that they had lost themselves and perished in the bush, and then we should perhaps be sent to Norfolk Island. I replied that Fagan was a very good swimmer, and that he was known to be so as well as myself, and they would also know that I would not go away and leave him. We then returned to the fire and agreed not to kill him. When we went back he was lying down by the fire, his shoes were off, and his feet were towards the fire, he was warming them. I then threw the axe down, and he looked up and said, have you put any snares down Ned? I said no, I have not put any down, there are snares enough if you but know it. I sat by him; Macavoy sat beyond me, he was on my right hand, and Fagan on my left. I was wishing to tell Fagan what had passed, but could not, as Macavoy was sitting with the axe close to him, looking at us. Then I lay down, and was in a doze, when I heard Fagan scream out; i leaped up on my feet in a dreadful fright and saw Fagan lying on his back with a dreadful cut in his head, and the blood pouring from it; Macavoy was standing over him with the axe in his hand. I cried to Macavoy you murdering rascal, you blood-thirsty wretch, what have you done? He said this will save our lives, and then he struck him another blow on the head with the axe. Fagan then groaned, and Macavoy cut his throat with a razor through the windpipe. We then began to strip Fagin, we stripped him naked. Fagan had on a red shirt, which I had stolen from Bradshaw at the Settlement, and which occasioned words and ill-feeling between Macavoy and myself, as to whom should become possessed of it; Fagan had also a red comforter and cap, which I likewise stole from Bradshaw, and gave him. I robbed Bradshaw of all I could lay my hands on, I left him not a mouthful of food when I came away. Bradshaw had always been very kind to me, and gave me anything in his power: But I have endeavored to kill him by making a tree fall upon him on account of his being a Constable, and getting people flogged.\"  \"Fagan's body we cut up into pieces, and roasted it; we roasted all but the hands, feet, and head; we roasted all at once, upon all occasions, as it was lighter to carry, and would keep longer, and not be so easily discovered. About two days after Fagan's murder, we heard some dogs, they had caught a kangaroo, and the dogs were wild. We got the kangaroo, and threw away the remainder of the body. Two days after this we gave ourselves up. I wish this statement to be made public after my death that it may serve as a warning!\"",

Our timber supply has been depleted to such an extent that according to statistics prepared by the United States Government, we take from our forests each year, not counting loss and waste, three and one half times their yearly growth; in other words, we use forty cubic feet per acre for each twelve cubic feet grown. We use two hundred and sixty cubic feet per capita, while Germany uses thirty-seven and France thirty-five. The large per capita consumption in the United States is attributable partly to our great fire losses, but principally to the ephemeral and flimsy character of our buildings. If the present rate of demand and supply is not changed, our timber resources will be entirely exhausted in a few years. Such a result would have far reaching consequences, and would be a national calamity. This can be averted, (1) by substituting incombustible and more durable materials for wood, and (2) by employing proper safeguards and appliances, thus preventing a large part of the annual fire loss.",

In order to understand how the signifier and signified relate to each other, one must be able to interpret signs. \"The only reason that the signifier does entail the signified is because there is a conventional relationship at play\". That is, a sign can only be understood when the relationship between the two components that make up the sign are agreed upon. Saussure argued that a sign's \"meaning depends on its relation to other words within the system\" (for example, to understand an individual word such as \"tree\", one must also understand the word \"bush\" and how the two relate to each other). It is this difference from other signs that allows the possibility of a speech community. However we need to remember that signifiers and their significance change all the time, becoming \"dated\". It is in this way that we are all \"practicing semioticians who pay a great deal of attention to signs\u2026 even though we may never have heard them before\" And while words are the most familiar form signs take, they stand for many things within life, such as advertisement, objects, body language, music, and so on.

This question may seem trivial; however, think of a human like a computer. The question would then become: How does a computer take in any factual information without previous programming? Plato answered his own question by stating that knowledge is present at birth and all information learned by a person is merely a recollection of something the soul has already learned previously, which is called the Theory of Recollection or Platonic epistemology. This answer could be further justified by a paradox: If a person knows something, they don't need to question it, and if a person does not know something, they don't know to question it. Plato says that if one did not previously know something, then they cannot learn it. He describes learning as a passive process, where information and knowledge are ironed into the soul over time. However, Plato's theory elicits even more questions about knowledge: If we can only learn something when we already had the knowledge impressed onto our souls, then how did our souls gain that knowledge in the first place? Plato's theory can seem convoluted; however, his classical theory can still help us understand knowledge today.",
