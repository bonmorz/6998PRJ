In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling. If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity. If, after a game is over, a ruling change is made that would have significantly altered the outcome of the game, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show.",

Each correct answer earns a monetary award, and allows the team to maintain control, while an incorrect answer, or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turns control over to the opponents. However, the team can dare their opponents to answer the question, doubling its value; in response, the opponents can double dare for quadruple the original value.

However, ipsative measures may, especially among testing-na\u00efve individuals exhibiting high levels of conscientiousness and/or neuroticism, decrease test validity by discouraging response and/or encouraging non-response. For example, a test's authors may force respondents to choose between \"a) Animals chase me in my dreams\" and \"b) My dreams are nice\" in an effort to see whether a given respondent is more inclined toward \"faking bad\" or toward \"faking good.\" When faced with such a question, a child frequently terrified by nightmares that rarely if ever involve animals, and especially one whose parents have taught him/her strict rules against lying, may simply refuse to answer the question given that for that respondent nearly all of the time both descriptions are inaccurate. Even a previously presented guideline \"Choose the answer that [best/better] describes you\" may be unhelpful in such a situation to responders who worry that endorsing one item or the other will still involve stating it to be accurate or \"well\"-descriptive to some positive degree. Only if the guideline is presented as \"Choose the answer that more accurately or less inaccurately describes you\" and the above-described responder is sophisticated enough to reason out his/her response in terms of \"Despite the infrequency with which I have nice dreams, I have them [more frequently / less infrequently] than dreams in which animals chase me\" (or, in theory, vice versa) will such a responder be willing to answer the question \u2014 and phrasing the guideline in this way bears its own cost of making the question reveal less about the respondent's propensities because the respondent is no longer forced to \"fake\" one way or another.",

Each correct answer by the studio contestants put the value into the studio bank, and earned that player a wedge for their scoring token, if they didn't have one of that selected color. An incorrect answer put the value in America's bank, and no money was put in the studio bank for that question, even if it was answered correctly by another player. The money was added each time a contestant attempted to answer the question and failed to answer correctly, so America's bank could have been credited with double or even triple the value of the question if more than one player gave an incorrect answer. If nobody buzzed in, or if nobody attempted the question after somebody answered that question incorrectly, the money was added to America's bank un-multiplied.",

Executive producer Conrad Green confirmed to Entertainment Tonight that the season would start off with 16 celebrities, with 3 double-eliminations halfway through the season. Former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay withdrew from the competition in week three; however, Debi Mazar was also eliminated on the same night, replacing the double elimination planned for week five. Some changes were added this season including a larger cast and relay dances. Four new dances were introduced to complement the large cast. Those dances were the bolero, lambada, two-step, and the Charleston. The cast was unveiled on the Monday, August 17, 2009, edition of \"Good Morning America\", returning to the announcement format of most seasons past. Tom Bergeron and Samantha Harris returned as the show's hosts. Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli, and Carrie Ann Inaba continue as the judges this season, with Baz Luhrmann appearing as a guest judge in week two, temporarily replacing Len Goodman.

In the later event, the host offers the player a final ride anyway. Regardless of the result, the $100 bonus for eating the food is not doubled or halved.",

One featured running gag on the show is the spoof segment \"Name That Molina\", where one of the personalities has to guess which of the three Molina catcher brothers \u2013 Bengie, Jose, or Yadier \u2013 is being shown. \"Name that LaRoche\" is another spoof segment featuring the two brothers who play for the Toronto Blue Jays Andy and the Washington Nationals Adam. Another running gag is the Umpire Fantasy League in which \"owners\" of umpires in this fictitious league are rewarded for their umpires ejecting players or coaches. It is unclear whether this is reference to the real-life Umpire Ejection Fantasy League. Also another gag in session is when an analyst on the show uses the \"Stump the host\" slogan. This is when the analyst has information on a certain players milestone that has just happened on the telecast. An example is when a player hits a home run, double, steals a base, or strikes someone out and the analyst will say \"Stump the Host; Career hr/strikeout/2-B/SB/etc. number __? The host very seldom knows the answer but will take a reasonable, and sometimes ludicrous, guess at what the answer might be. This gag is very seldom used but sometimes is quite comical for the fact that the host has no idea what the answer may be.",
