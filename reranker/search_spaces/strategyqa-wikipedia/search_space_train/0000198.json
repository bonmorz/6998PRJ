If the shot was in a downward angle the bullet would have hit the road forty feet from where Hodson was hit, it also suggested that Hodson could have been shot from another elevated point and possibly by another prison officer. It would cast doubt that Ryan had fired the fatal shot. But the prosecution argued that Hodson 6 feet 1\u00a0inch (1.85 m) tall could have been running in a stooped position, thus accounting for the bullet's fatal angle of entry.

Aasen was a Freemason. He raised to the degree of Master Mason at Highland Park Lodge No. 382, Los Angeles on July 14, 1924. When in Sheyenne, Aasen's mother operated a restaurant. He attended school and helped out in the family business. In 1902, Aasen's mother died. He was taken into many homes and families. When a family he was staying with started to operate a hotel in Leeds, North Dakota, he moved with them there. Aasen's growth started slowly. When he was confirmed in the Lutheran faith in Grandfield Lutheran Church near Sheyenne, North Dakota, he was the shortest in his class.

Each of the five monsters has traits traceable to sci-fi/horror B movies from the 1950s, '60s and '70s, although none is a mere copy of an older character. Susan, who grows to be 49 feet 11 inches tall, was inspired by \"Attack of the 50 Foot Woman\". Dr. Cockroach represents \"The Fly\" and \"The Curse of Frankenstein\", while B.O.B. is an amalgam of slithering and slimy characters that were featured in the films, including \"The Blob\" and \"The Crawling Eye\". Insectosaurus, a 350-foot-tall monster, is a nod to the 1961 Japanese film \"Mothra\". According to Vernon, the Missing Link has no direct inspiration. He \"just represents anything prehistoric that comes back to life and terrorizes people.\" For the San Francisco sequence, the producers researched lots of films and photographs for an accurate depiction of the city, and filmed animator Line Andersen, who had a similar body type to Ginormica\u2014tall, thin, and athletic-looking\u2014walking alongside a scale model of San Francisco, to capture better how a person not comfortable with being too big with an environment would walk around it.",

One of the oldest methods used by astronomers to calculate the distance to a star is to record the difference in angle between two measurements of the position of the star in the sky. The first measurement is taken from the Earth on one side of the Sun, and the second is taken approximately half a year later, when the Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun. The distance between the two positions of the Earth when the two measurements were taken is twice the distance between the Earth and the Sun. The difference in angle between the two measurements is twice the parallax angle, which is formed by lines from the Sun and Earth to the star at the distant vertex. Then the distance to the star could be calculated using trigonometry. The first successful published direct measurements of an object at interstellar distances were undertaken by German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel in 1838, who used this approach to calculate the 3.5-parsec distance of 61 Cygni. The parallax of a star is defined as half of the angular distance that a star appears to move relative to the celestial sphere as Earth orbits the Sun. Equivalently, it is the subtended angle, from that star's perspective, of the semimajor axis of the Earth's orbit. The star, the Sun and the Earth form the corners of an imaginary right triangle in space: the right angle is the corner at the Sun, and the corner at the star is the parallax angle. The length of the opposite side to the parallax angle is the distance from the Earth to the Sun (defined as one astronomical unit (au), and the length of the adjacent side gives the distance from the sun to the star. Therefore, given a measurement of the parallax angle, along with the rules of trigonometry, the distance from the Sun to the star can be found. A parsec is defined as the length of the side adjacent to the vertex occupied by a star whose parallax angle is one arcsecond.",

Basil Frankenstein and his Japanese assistant Dr. Kitagowa had moved to Victor Frankenstein's castle to continue his mission of creating an army of zombie Nazi soldiers.

Due to Basil Frankenstein being in love with Dr. Kitagowa, Basil wanted her to place his brain into Captain America's body so that they can finally have a physical love.

In the nick of time, Namor arrived into the castle and freed the Invaders.

To transfer \"d\u03b3\" into the usual unit of minutes of arc, a multiplicative constant \"c\" is inserted whose value is 3437.75 (1 radian in arcminutes). In the calculation a, dz and z must be in the same units, say, feet, inches, cm or meters. For the average interocular distance of 6.5\u00a0cm, a target distance of 6m and a typical stereoacuity of 0.5 minute of arc, the just detectable depth interval is 8\u00a0cm. As targets come closer, this interval gets smaller by the inverse square of the distance, so that an equivalent detectable depth interval at \u00bc meter is 0.01\u00a0cm or the depth of impression of the head on a coin. These very small values of normal stereoacuity, expressed in differences of either object distances, or angle of disparity, makes it a hyperacuity.",

Fearing for his family, Victor reluctantly agrees and travels to England to do his work. Working on a second being on the Orkney Islands, he is plagued by premonitions of what his work might wreak, particularly the idea that creating a mate for the creature might lead to the breeding of an entire race of creatures that could plague mankind. He destroys the unfinished female creature after he sees his first creation looking through the window. The monster witnesses this and vows to be with Victor on his upcoming wedding night.

When Frankenstein retreats to the mountains, the monster approaches him at the summit and asks his creator to build him a female mate.

Frankenstein agrees and builds a female creature, but, aghast at the possibility of creating a race of monsters, destroys his experiment. In response, the monster kills Frankenstein's best friend Henry Clerval, and later kills Frankenstein's bride Elizabeth Lavenza on their wedding night; whereupon Frankenstein's father dies of grief. Frankenstein dedicates himself to destroying his creation. Searching for the monster in the Arctic Circle, Frankenstein falls into the freezing water, contracting severe pneumonia. A ship exploring the region encounters the dying Frankenstein, who relates his story to the ship's captain, Robert Walton.

In his primary stance (the posture of the straight line), Thibault describes an upright posture which allows for fluid, graceful motion while remaining profiled to the opponent. Thibault argues in favor of a \"natural\" stance, similar to an ordinary posture while standing or walking. This involves holding the feet several inches apart, at an angle of roughly 45 degrees to one another. Unusually, Thibault does not believe that the toes of the front foot should be pointed at the opponent, rather being pointed to the angle of the interior subjection (Thibault's method of pushing the opponent's sword down and aside). Thibault describes the placement of the feet in relation to an imaginary line drawn between a swordsman and his opponent (Thibault calls this line the \"diameter\"). The swordsman's back foot would be perpendicular to this line, while his front foot would angle inward, with the weight distributed evenly on the balls of the feet. This positioning of the front foot allows you to walk into the subjection.",

Del Toro said his \"Frankenstein\" would be a faithful \"Miltonian tragedy\", citing Frank Darabont's \"near perfect\" script, which evolved into Kenneth Branagh's \"Frankenstein\". Del Toro said of his vision, \"What I'm trying to do is take the myth and do something with it, but combining elements of \"Frankenstein\" and \"Bride of Frankenstein\" without making it just a classical myth of the monster. The best moments in my mind of \"Frankenstein\", of the novel, are yet to be filmed [...] The only guy that has ever nailed for me the emptiness, not the tragic, not the Miltonian dimension of the monster, but the emptiness is Christopher Lee in the Hammer films, where he really looks like something obscenely alive. Boris Karloff has the tragedy element nailed down but there are so many versions, including that great screenplay by Frank Darabont that was ultimately not really filmed.\" He has also cited Bernie Wrightson's illustrations as inspiration, and said the film will not focus on the monster's creation, but be an adventure film featuring the character. Del Toro said he would like Wrightson to design his version of the creature. The film will also focus on the religious aspects of Shelley's tale. In June 2009, del Toro stated that production on \"Frankenstein\" was not likely to begin for at least four years. Despite this, he has already cast frequent collaborator Doug Jones in the role of Frankenstein's monster. In an interview with Sci Fi Wire, Jones stated that he learned of the news the same day as everybody else; that \"Guillermo did say to the press that he\u2019s already cast me as his monster, but we\u2019ve yet to talk about it. But in his mind, if that\u2019s what he\u2019s decided, then it's done ... It would be a dream come true.\" The film will be a period piece.",
