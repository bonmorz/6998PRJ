The only possession they had when they came to India was nothing more than the sacred fire from their temple. Under British rule they prospered immensely. It is estimated that there are 130,000 Zoroastrians in the world; majority of them, about 100,000 live in India.

In the early 20th century retired bankers, accountants and businessmen moved from west coast and established themselves in Bangalore, as in those days, Bangalore was considered a retirement paradise. The early settlers to Bangalore built the fire temple on Queen's Road in 1926 with the help of Dinshaw Cawasji, a contractor from Mumbai and called it the 'Baidhanmai and Cawasji Dadabhai Dar-E-Meher', which caters to the small group of Parsis, about 700, residing in the city.

The idea of smoking tobacco has been looked down upon in modern Zoroastrian communities due to the scientific knowledge of it causing harm to the body. This stance on smoking does not have a direct relation to the texts of the Avestas and is not stated in the religion, rather the religion teaches to not misuse fire as it is holy. Zoroastrianism teaches to do what is best for the world based on the knowledge a person has on the topic, and indirectly the knowledge of smoking being harmful to the body causes people to condemn the act.",

Nasu appears in various texts within the Avesta, notably the \"Vendidad\", as the \"Vendidad\" gives particular focus to demons, purification rituals, and the disposal of corpses and other dead matter. Nasu is commonly considered \u201cthe greatest polluter of Ahura Mazda\u2019s world.\u201d Belief in Nasu has greatly influenced Zoroastrian funeral rites and burial ceremonies, as well as the general disdain for corpse matter that is harbored within Zoroastrian practitioners.",
