The New Testament contains warnings against teachings considered to be only masquerading as Christianity, and shows how reference was made to the leaders of the church to decide what was true doctrine. The Catholic Church believes that it is the continuation of those who remained faithful to the apostolic leadership and rejected false teachings. Catholic belief is that the Church will never defect from the truth, and bases this on Jesus' telling Peter \"the gates of hell will not prevail against\" the church. In the \"Gospel of John\", Jesus states, \"I have much more to tell you, but you cannot bear it now. But when he comes, the Spirit of truth, he will guide you to all truth\".",

For a casual observer the Church is just a social reality \u2013 an association of human beings who profess a common faith, who participate in a common worship and who endeavour to live by a common ethical code. But for believing Christians the Church is also a faith reality. There is a grace-filled depth to the Church. In the Apostles\u2019 Creed we profess: \"We believe in the holy Catholic Church.\" It is the faith understanding of the Church that will be articulated here.  The Church is not a purely human enterprise. God is at work in the origin and development of the Church. That is what we Christians believe. St. Paul speaks of \"the Church of God that is at Corinth\" (1 Cor. 1:2). This probably refers to the local Christian community there. In The Bible \"the Church of the living God\" most likely denotes the entire world-wide assembly of the followers of Jesus Christ. The Second Vatican Council (1962\u201365) spoke of the mystery of the Church. The Church is a mystery because it is part of God\u2019s plan of salvation. In the New Testament, particularly in the Letters of Paul, mystery refers to the divine design for the salvation of humankind. It was God\u2019s plan to offer to everyone the possibility of salvation and to assemble in the Church all those who would believe in his Son. When we say that the Church is a mystery we not only mean that the Church is part of God\u2019s plan of salvation for humankind but also that God is at all times present and active in the Church. As Pope Paul VI stated: \"The Church is a mystery. It is a reality imbued with the hidden presence of God.\". The expression, the Church of God, also signifies a Church that is rooted in the experience of God. Just as Israel originated in the experience of the liberating God in Exodus, so too the Christian Church sprang up from the experience of the saving God in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. One becomes a member of the Church by sharing this experience. Against this background we can see how significant it is that in Ecclesia in Asia Pope John Paul II exhorts the Church to be ever more deeply \"rooted in the experience of God which flows from a living faith.\" Only then can the Church fulfil its vocation to be a meeting place of God and human beings. As the Pope declares: \"The Church cannot therefore be understood merely as a social organization or agency of human welfare. Despite having sinful men and women in her midst, the Church must be seen as the privileged place of encounter between God and human beings, in which God chooses to reveal the mystery of his inner life and carry out his plan of salvation for the world.\"",

Pope John Paul II emphasizes heavily on protecting a person's dignity in using media, which will require a positive development, that has clear structure, since media not only provide for mere entertainment, but has close connections to all areas of human life, \"i.e. Politics, economy, culture\". There are three \u201cfundamental options\u201d) the Church and her members face today: formation, participation, and dialogue. First, the formation of media has to be closely observed and filtered, such as formation of a new vocabulary used widely in media, then spreading to everyday language. Pope John Paul II notes that without \u201cproper formation,\u201d) the media would no longer be serving humanity, but shaping our beliefs and minds. In this, chiefly the younger generation are the most concerned, who would need critical and responsible education on the use of media(11). Second, a true participation by all members are encouraged, in which the Pope calls for a \u201cculture of co-responsibility,\u201d towards handling of media. Lastly, mass media's role of promoting dialogue and as tool of reciprocal knowledge is highlighted. However, this feature is like a double-edged sword, in that if used for good purpose, it can become the most powerful tool in spreading peace and understandings amongst humanity, or, \u201ca destructive weapon\u201d) if it were to be used in a negative manner. Pope John Paul II refers to his predecessors, who have discussed about such features of media we face today, such as Pius XII. Pius XII recognized the value of public opinion within and towards the Church, which is a strong feature of media communications. Also, according to the Code of Canon Law, everyone has a right to express their opinion. Therefore, John Paul II is telling the readers that his goal of writing such document on media today, isn't aiming for complete control and coercion over the people's mind and opinions. Although the Church must not leave room for arbitrary interpretations of the faith, by no means it is promoting the absolute power of the Church\u2014rather, he notes that the dialogue between the faithful is valued within the Church.

Pope John Paul II was particularly attached to F\u00e1tima and credited Our Lady of F\u00e1tima with saving his life after he was shot in Rome on the Feast Day of Our Lady of F\u00e1tima in May 1981. He donated the bullet that wounded him on that day to the Roman Catholic sanctuary at F\u00e1tima Portugal.",

In Catholic ecclesiology there are two dimensions to think about,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Petrine dimension, which is from the Apostle Peter, and the Apostolic College, which is the pastoral activity of the bishops, as well as the Marian dimension, which is the feminine dimension of the Church.\u201d The Church is depicted as the bride of Christ, as a woman. Francis has authorized a commission to see if women could be made deaconesses. On June 20, 2018 Francis said, \"We cannot do this with Holy Orders (women priests) because dogmatically we cannot.

In Catholicism, it is argued that the primacy of Peter is a basis for the primacy of the bishop of Rome over other bishops throughout the Church via the doctrine of Apostolic succession. This extension of Petrine primacy to popes is known as the primacy of the Bishop of Rome, also known as the primacy of the Roman Pontiff. This Catholic Church doctrine holds that the papacy has authority delegated from Jesus to rule over the entire Church. There are various views on the nature of the primacy and how it has been exercised and passed on. This belief makes a distinction between the personal prestige of Peter and the supremacy of the office of pope which Catholics believe Jesus instituted in the person of Peter. Some, but not nearly all, Protestant denominations accept the concept of the primacy of Peter, but believe it was only relevant during the lifetime of Peter. They do not believe the pope holds any authority over the universal Church.",

In some countries they kill Christians because they wear a cross or have a Bible, and before killing them they don't ask if they're Anglicans, Lutherans, Catholics or Orthodox. The blood is mixed.\" During the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, Pope Francis addressed the attendees of the \"John 17 Movement\" gathering opining that \"Division is the work of the Father of Lies\" and that he \"knows that Christians are disciples of Christ: that they are one, that they are brothers! He doesn't care if they are Evangelicals, or Orthodox, Lutherans, Catholics or Apostolic... he doesn't care! They are Christians. And that blood (of martyrdom) unites. Today, dear brothers and sisters, we are living an 'ecumenism of blood'. This must encourage us to do what we are doing today: to pray, to dialogue together, to shorten the distance between us, to strengthen our bonds of brotherhood.\" During the 2016 Octave of Christian Unity, Pope Francis \"asked forgiveness for the way Catholics had treated other Christian believers over the years, and also invited Catholics to pardon those who had persecuted them.\"",

To this view, Ratzinger's theology is based on his early works, staunch Catholicism and ancient Tradition. According to this often held view, Benedict has made clear that he intends to preserve the Church doctrine and not give in to modern pressures for change to fundamental dogma and teaching on such issues as birth control, abortion, and homosexuality. It is also noted, that the Pope has a strong opposition to moral relativism, which he sees as producing views ranging \"from one extreme to the other: from Marxism to liberalism, even to libertinism; from collectivism to radical individualism; from atheism to a vague religious mysticism; from agnosticism to syncretism, and so forth.\"",

Some Jewish, Christian and Muslim Medieval philosophers, including Moses Maimonides and Pseudo-Dionysius, as well as many sages of other religions, developed what is termed as apophatic theology or the \"Via Negativa\", the idea that one cannot posit attributes to God and can only discuss what God is not. For example, we cannot say that God \"exists\" in the usual sense of the term, because that term is human defined and God's qualities such as existence may not be accurately characterized by it. What we can safely say is that it cannot be proven empirically or otherwise that God is existent, therefore \"God is not non-existent\". Likewise God's \"wisdom\" is of a fundamentally different kind from limited human perception. So we cannot use the word \"wise\" to describe God, because this implies God is wise in the way we usually describe humans being wise. However we can safely say that \"God is not ignorant\". We should not say that God is One, because we may not truly understand Gods nature, but we can state that there is no multiplicity in God's being. In the Quran it is stated that God possess no quality of God's creation, which means that there cannot be a He or She used to describe God. To say that God is angered or feels any kind of emotion is a misunderstanding. Emotion is in common to all humans; it is what gives them their essence, though to feel love, anger, jealousy, or happiness clouds and misguides our judgment and may lead us to make a weak decision or do something unfair. Therefore, One who sees all and can feel all does not need any emotion to make a decision. God is beyond emotion and other human biases.",
