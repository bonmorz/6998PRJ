A further ambiguity with yes\u2013no questions, in addition to that of polarity, is the ambiguity of whether an \"exclusive\" or \"inclusive\" disjunction is meant by the word \"or\", as it can represent either. Conventionally, in English yes\u2013no questions the \"or\" represents an exclusive disjunction. However, as with the \"Would you like an apple or an orange?\" question mentioned earlier, to which one possible answer, as a yes\u2013no question, is \"yes.\", yes\u2013no questions can also be taken to be \"inclusive\" disjunctions. The informativeness of the \"or\" in the question is low, especially if the second alternative in the question is \"something\" or \"things\". The \"exclusive\" and \"inclusive\" can be determined often in spoken language (the speaker will often lower their pitch at the end of an \"exclusive\" question, as opposed to raising it at the end of an \"inclusive\" question), but it is a frequent source of humour for computer scientists and others familiar with Boolean logic, who will give responses such as \"yes\" to questions such as \"Would you like chicken or roast beef for dinner?\". However, the ambiguity is not confined to humour. The apple-or-orange question may be legitimately asking whether either is wanted, for example, and \"Would you like an apple or something?\" is indeed \"expecting\" either \"yes\" or \"no\" as a proper answer rather than the answer \"Something\" that an exclusive disjunction would be requesting.",

In humans, it is defined as a body core temperature below . Symptoms depend on the temperature. In mild hypothermia there is shivering and mental confusion. In moderate hypothermia shivering stops and confusion increases. In severe hypothermia, there may be paradoxical undressing, in which a person removes his or her clothing, as well as an increased risk of the heart stopping. Hypothermia has two main types of causes. It classically occurs from exposure to extreme cold. It may also occur from any condition that decreases heat production or increases heat loss. Commonly this includes alcohol intoxication but may also include low blood sugar, anorexia, and advanced age. Body temperature is usually maintained near a constant level of through thermoregulation. Efforts to increase body temperature involve shivering, increased voluntary activity, and putting on warmer clothing. Hypothermia may be diagnosed based on either a person's symptoms in the presence of risk factors or by measuring a person's core temperature. The treatment of mild hypothermia involves warm drinks, warm clothing, and physical activity. In those with moderate hypothermia, heating blankets and warmed intravenous fluids are recommended. People with moderate or severe hypothermia should be moved gently. In severe hypothermia, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass may be useful. In those without a pulse, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is indicated along with the above measures. Rewarming is typically continued until a person's temperature is greater than . If there is no improvement at this point or the blood potassium level is greater than 12\u00a0mmol/liter at any time, resuscitation may be discontinued. Hypothermia is the cause of at least 1,500 deaths a year in the United States. It is more common in older people and males. One of the lowest documented body temperatures from which someone with accidental hypothermia has survived is in a near-drowning of a 7-year-old girl in Sweden. Survival after more than six hours of CPR has been described. For those for whom ECMO or bypass is used, survival is around 50%. Deaths due to hypothermia have played an important role in many wars. The term is from Greek \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf, \"ypo\", meaning \"under\", and \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1, \"therm\u00eda\", meaning \"heat\".

Thermoregulation is the ability of an organism to keep its body temperature within certain boundaries, even when the surrounding temperature is very different. A thermoconforming organism, by contrast, simply adopts the surrounding temperature as its own body temperature, thus avoiding the need for internal thermoregulation. The internal thermoregulation process is one aspect of homeostasis: a state of dynamic stability in an organism's internal conditions, maintained far from thermal equilibrium with its environment (the study of such processes in zoology has been called physiological ecology). If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal, a condition known as hyperthermia occurs. For humans, this occurs when the body is exposed to constant temperatures of approximately , and with prolonged exposure (longer than a few hours) at this temperature and up to around death is almost inevitable. Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the wet bulb temperature is sustained above for six hours. The opposite condition, when body temperature decreases below normal levels, is known as hypothermia. It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction, causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it. Normal body temperature is around , and hypothermia sets in when the core body temperature gets lower than . Usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures, hypothermia is usually treated by methods that attempt to raise the body temperature back to a normal range.",

Heat is more likely to increase the risk of mortality in cities in the northern part of the country than in the southern regions of the country. For example, when Chicago, Denver, or New York experience unusually hot summertime temperatures, elevated levels of illness and death are predicted. In contrast, parts of the country that are mild to hot year-round have a lower public health risk from excessive heat. Research shows that residents of southern cities, such as Miami, Tampa, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, tend to be acclimated to hot weather conditions and therefore less vulnerable to heat related deaths. However, as a whole, people in the United States appear to be adapting to hotter temperatures further north each decade.
