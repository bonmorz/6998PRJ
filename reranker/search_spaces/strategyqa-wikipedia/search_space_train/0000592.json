Celebrated later paintings by Raphael, \"La velata\" (1515\u201316) and \"Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione\" (c.\u00a01514\u201315), continued to borrow from Leonardo's painting. Zollner states that \"None of Leonardo's works would exert more influence upon the evolution of the genre than the \"Mona Lisa\".

One notable work she created is \"Mona/Leo\", for which she compared the image of a Leonardo da Vinci self-portrait with the \"Mona Lisa\", matching the two faces feature by feature to show their underlying structural similarity. Specifically, she replaced the right side of the \"Mona Lisa\" with the flipped left side of a red chalk self-portrait of Leonardo. Superimposed lines drawn on the image showing the close alignments of the bottom of the eye, eyebrow, nose and chin prompted her to argue that the Mona Lisa is in part a cryptic self-portrait of the artist. In further experiments along these lines, she removed the gray tones in Leonardo da Vinci's self-portrait and superimposed the \"Mona Lisa\" eye over it. Not everyone is convinced by her argument for the identity of Leonardo da Vinci and the \"Mona Lisa\"; one common counter-argument is that the similarities are due to both portraits having been created by the same person and therefore bearing the hallmarks of a characteristic style. Additionally, though the drawing on which Schwartz based the comparison is held to be a self-portrait, there is no firm historical evidence to support this theory.",

Some researchers also believe that Sala\u00ec and not Lisa del Giocondo was the real model for the \"Mona Lisa\" but this claim is disputed by the Louvre. During Leonardo's second stay in Milan, he took another young pupil, Francesco Melzi. Unlike Sala\u00ec, Francesco was a son of a nobleman. When Leonardo traveled to Rome in 1513 and to France in 1516, Sala\u00ec and Melzi both accompanied him. As an adult, Melzi became secretary and main assistant of Leonardo, and undertook to prepare Leonardo's writings for publication. Vasari says that Melzi \"at the time of Leonardo was a very beautiful and very much loved young man\". In France, Francesco Melzi was greeted as \"Italian gentleman living with master Leonardo\" and granted donation of 400\u00a0ecus, while Sala\u00ec, already over 40\u00a0years old, was described as \"servant\" and granted a one time donation of 100\u00a0ecus. Sala\u00ec left Leonardo and France in 1518. He later returned to Milan to work on Leonardo's vineyard, previously worked by Sala\u00ec's father, half of which was granted to him by Leonardo's will. It is commonly believed that upon Leonardo's death in 1519, Sala\u00ec inherited several paintings including the \"Mona Lisa\". Through his estate, many of those works, notably the \"Mona Lisa\", passed into the possession of Francis I of France. While Leonardo left all personal belongings, paintings, drawings and notes to Francesco Melzi in his will, it's unclear whether this included the \"Mona Lisa\".",

Although the Louvre states that it was \"doubtless painted between 1503 and 1506\", the art historian Martin Kemp says there are some difficulties in confirming the actual dates with certainty. In addition, many Leonardo experts, such as Carlo Pedretti and Alessandro Vezzosi, are of the opinion that the painting is characteristic of Leonardo\u2019s style in the final years of his life, post-1513. Other academics argue that, given the historical documentation, Leonardo would have painted the work from 1513. According to Leonardo's contemporary, Giorgio Vasari, \"after he had lingered over it four years, [he] left it unfinished\". Leonardo, later in his life, is said to have regretted \"never having completed a single work\". Circa 1504, Raphael executed a pen and ink sketch, today in the Louvre museum, in which the subject is flanked by large columns. Experts universally agree it is based on Leonardo\u2019s portrait of \"Mona Lisa\". Other later copies of the \"Mona Lisa\", such as those in the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo and The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, also display large flanking columns. As a result, it was originally thought that the \"Mona Lisa\" in the Louvre had side columns and had been cut. However, as early as 1993, Z\u00f6llner observed that the painting surface had never been trimmed. This was confirmed through a series of tests conducted in 2004. In view of this, Vincent Delieuvin, curator of 16th-century Italian painting at the Louvre museum states that the sketch and these other copies must have been inspired by another version, while Frank Z\u00f6llner states that the sketch brings up the possibility that Leonardo executed another work on the subject of Mona Lisa.",

            "document": "Lillian Schwartz . Schwartz used the works of Leonardo da Vinci extensively in experiments with computers. One notable work she created is \"Mona/Leo\", for which she compared the image of a Leonardo da Vinci self-portrait with the \"Mona Lisa\", matching the two faces feature by feature to show their underlying structural similarity. Specifically, she replaced the right side of the \"Mona Lisa\" with the flipped left side of a red chalk self-portrait of Leonardo. Superimposed lines drawn on the image showing the close alignments of the bottom of the eye, eyebrow, nose and chin prompted her to argue that the Mona Lisa is in part a cryptic self-portrait of the artist. In further experiments along these lines, she removed the gray tones in Leonardo da Vinci's self-portrait and superimposed the \"Mona Lisa\" eye over it. Not everyone is convinced by her argument for the identity of Leonardo da Vinci and the \"Mona Lisa\"; one common counter-argument is that the similarities are due to both portraits having been created by the same person and therefore bearing the hallmarks of a characteristic style. Additionally, though the drawing on which Schwartz based the comparison is held to be a self-portrait, there is no firm historical evidence to support this theory.",

Some argued that Lisa del Giocondo was the subject of a different portrait, identifying at least four other paintings as the \"Mona Lisa\" referred to by Vasari. Several other women have been proposed as the subject of the painting. Isabella of Aragon, Cecilia Gallerani, Costanza d'Avalos, Duchess of Francavilla, Isabella d'Este, Pacifica Brandano or Brandino, Isabela Gualanda, Caterina Sforza\u2014even Sala\u00ec and Leonardo himself\u2014are all among the list of posited models portrayed in the painting. The consensus of art historians in the 21st century maintains the long-held traditional opinion, that the painting depicts Lisa del Giocondo.",

            "document": "Mona Lisa . Today the \"Mona Lisa\" is considered the most famous painting in the world, but until the 20th century it was simply one among many highly regarded artworks. Once part of King Francis I of France's collection, the \"Mona Lisa\" was among the very first artworks to be exhibited in Louvre, which became a national museum after the French Revolution. From the 19th century Leonardo began to be revered as a genius and the painting's popularity grew from the mid-19th century when French intelligentsia developed a theme that it was somehow mysterious and a representation of the femme fatale. The Baedeker guide in 1878 called it \"the most celebrated work of Leonardo in the Louvre\", but the painting was known more by the intelligentsia than the general public. The 1911 theft of the \"Mona Lisa\" and its subsequent return, however, was reported worldwide, leading to a massive increase in public recognition of the painting. During the 20th century it was an object for mass reproduction, merchandising, lampooning and speculation, and was claimed to have been reproduced in \"300 paintings and 2,000 advertisements\". It has been said that the \"Mona Lisa\" was regarded as \"just another Leonardo until early last century, when the scandal of the painting's theft from the Louvre and subsequent return kept a spotlight on it over several years.\"",
