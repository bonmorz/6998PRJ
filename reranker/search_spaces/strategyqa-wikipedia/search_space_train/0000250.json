The Romantic poets were influenced by all their famous predecessors, when writing sonnets, but the most important single influence was Milton, who had written less than 30 sonnets himself. In the 17th century Milton kept the sonnet form alive while also expanding the subject matter \u2013 which hitherto had mainly been love \u2013 by writing about ideas, events, history, and contemporary issues. Like Milton, the Romantics wrote relatively few love sonnets and the sonnet of the Romantic era include politics, nature, friendship, art, history, religion, life and death. In fact some of the Romantic poets even wrote sonnets about sonnets. Wordsworth\u2019s \"Scorn not the Sonnet\" is an example of this. Keats also wrote about sonnets, most notably in \"On the Sonnet\" (1819), which like Wordsworth's poem defends the form in content and by using it himself.",

In Sonnet 78 we find out about a rival who is male and a poet and whose entry initiates an episode of jealousy that comes to a close in only Sonnet 86 These sonnets are considered to be the Rival Poet sonnets. The rival poet sonnets include three primary players; the fair youth, the rival poet, and the lady who is desired by both men. The identities of these three players have been a controversy for hundreds of years and many experts disagree on the personage of the fair youth, rival poet, and lady.  The author Joseph Pequigney discusses the historic background of the rival poet, fair youth, and lady and states, \"The rival poet referred to in Sonnet 78 to 86, (a) are wholly fictitious, or (b) are depictions of real but unknown persons, or (c) admit of historical identifications. In the case of (c) speculation centers mostly on the youth who is surmised to be either the earl of Southampton or the earl of Pembroke or, occasionally, some other nobleman. Marlowe and Chapman are the leading candidates for the role of the literary rival, the lady has generally fared less well in generating a historical counterpart. Regardless of whether the incidents and interpersonal transactions rendered are actual or imaginary, everything comes through as uncertain or indistinct because the Quarto, unauthorized and unsupervised by Shakespeare, (a) prints the Sonnets in a version to be understood as disarranged to a greater or lesser extent, or (b) the order of the poems in Q must be accepted in lieu of more satisfactory alternative, or (c) the lost original order may be reconstructed by acute transpositions.\" As with the fair youth there is some debate over the personage of the rival poet. Other experts disagree with Pequigney's assessment and another expert stated, \"Among biographically minded commentators, a favourite candidate for Rival Poet has been Christopher Marlowe\".  The author R.J.C. Wait believes that the youth is none other than the Earl of Southampton. Waits states, \"Shakespeare now clearly recognizes that Southampton is giving assistance to one or more rivals\". Another perspective is given by the author Macd. P. Jackson who states, \"There can be no simple equation of a figure in Shakespeare's sonnets with a historical, biological personage.\" Waits argues that there are too many similarities for the fair youth to be anyone other than the Earl of Southampton, who was a known patron of the arts. The controversy around the identities of the fair youth, rival poet(s), and lady are an age old argument and may never be resolved as Shakespeare never explicitly identifies the individuals in the Sonnets.",

There have been many arguments by scholars whether or not the sonnet was written about Shakespeare's disdain with the stage and his career in the theater, or if the sonnet is a confession of love to an unknown young man. Shakespeare's use of the word motley has the mind of critics and scholars boggled as to what the sonnet could truly mean. A motley is a multi-colored gown, or costume, usually worn by a jester. Many scholars believe that the sonnet is written about Shakespeare's disdain with the theater and the actors, or even his own profession as an actor. Katherine Duncan-Jones believes that the sonnet is about Shakespeare's feelings about his own career as an actor. Scholar Henry Reed agrees with Duncan-Jones and believes that the sonnet is written about Shakespeare's own disdain with his acting career. The third line of the quatrain also suggests that the sonnet could be about the theater. Gored could be used in the sense of sewing triangular sized cloths into the motley that would be worn by the actor. However, there are other scholars that would disagree with the two. Among these scholars is Kenneth Muir who says, \"the theatrical image does not imply that he was referring to his job as an actor.\" According to Virginia Radley and David Redding, the interpretation of the sonnet being about Shakespeare's profession as an actor is wrong. Radley and Redding suggests that \"sonnet 110 has nothing to do with the stage, or the acting, or the play writing.\" Radley and Redding interpreted the first quatrain as the poets confession of promiscuity. Lines 1-2 suggests that the poet has been around and has made a fool of himself for the world to see. Here, the word motley is used as in \"I played the fool.\" Line 3 suggests that the poet put himself on display and gave away his precious love. With the use of the word gored, Radley and Redding translated the phrase \"gored mine own thoughts\" to \"wounded my best thoughts\". The last line of this quatrain uses the word offences is used in the correct term as in offending the poet's lover by this new affairs he has encountered.

Landry acknowledges the sonnet \"has the grandeur of generality or a 'universal significance',\" but cautions that \"however timeless and universal its implications may be, we must never forget that Sonnet 116 has a restricted or particular range of meaning simply because it does not stand alone.\" Carol Thomas Neely writes that, \"Sonnet 116 is part of a sequence which is separate from all the other sonnets of Shakespeare because of their sense of detachment. They aren't about the action of love and the object of that love is removed in this sequence which consists of Sonnets 94, 116, and 129\". This group of three sonnets does not fit the mold of the rest of Shakespeare's sonnets, therefore, and they defy the typical concept and give a different perspective of what love is and how it is portrayed or experienced. \"Though 116 resolves no issues, the poet in this part of the sequence acknowledges and accepts the fallibility of his love more fully than he could acknowledge that of the young man's earlier\". Other critics of Sonnet 116 have argued that one cannot rely on the context of the sonnet to understand its tone. They argue that since \"there is no indisputably authoritative sequence to them, we cannot make use of context as positive evidence for one kind of tone or another.\" Shakespeare does not attempt to come to any significant conclusion within this particular sonnet because no resolution is needed.",

Nonetheless, he filled his sonnets with references to other Elizabethan poets whom he respected. In Sonnet 54, especially the line \"The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem,\u201d we see a reference to Edmund Spenser's Amoretti, Sonnet 26, the first line of which is \"Sweet is the rose, but growes upon a brere.\" This reference is just one of many which help to \"proclaim Shakespeare's deepest literary values and his recurrent aesthetic convictions.\" While Shakespeare honors his contemporaries, one of the things that make Shakespeare so great was how he differed from them. The Amoretti is a series of sonnets focused on a much more traditional topic, the courting which led to Spencer's marriage. In the Amoretti, Spenser proposes \"that a resolution to the sonneteer's conventional preoccupations with love may be found within the bounds of Christian marriage.\" Shakespeare's Sonnets have a much more complicated, pained, and almost indecipherable message about love.",

She diverges from the Petrarchan norm. \"Golden locks\" and \"florid cheeks\" were fashionable in that day, but Shakespeare's lady does not bear those traits. The lady is shown as being both fair and foul, and both kind and unkind. Alice F. Moore feels that within these later sonnets the poet is equally as dark as the lady. As the speaker reveals the mistress in her \"foulness\" and \"deceit\", he consequently reveals himself. These sonnets are shadowed by the speakers own self-hatred and anger. However, Joel Fineman believes that the biggest difference between series of the dark lady and the other series of sonnets featuring the young man is that those about the dark lady use a formula of lusty misogyny that is clearly Shakespearean. Throughout the sonnets, and especially sonnet 138, the lady \"comes to occupy this peculiarly charged erotic place (\"therefore I lie with her, and she with me,/And in our faults by lies we flattered be\"). The sonnets addressed to the dark lady usually relate the lady with \"a disjunction occasioned by verbal duplicity,\" (\"When my love swears that she is made of truth,/I do believe her, though I know she lies\"). The language in the dark lady sonnets is some that \"one is forced to hear-- to hear, that is, as language-- functions as a supplementary and confirming, not a disavowing, gloss on what the poet has to say\". They \"conceal praise under the guise of disparagement (Kambascovic-Sawers p. 293). A.L. Rowse believes that the sonnet takes us further into Shakespeare's relationship with the lady. The relationship is both \"purely sexual\" and \"utterly unromantic\". However, it can also be said that the speaker is not attracted to the woman because of her \"physical, intellectual, or moral excellence\". Instead, the attraction is portrayed as being \"self-generated, with no basis in 'reality'. Rowse feels that the woman discussed in the sonnet can be identified as the mistress, Emilia. Shakespeare is six years older, and is thus highly conscious of his age. Underneath all the hyprocrisies there is Shakespeare's \"honest candour.\" In \"Shakespeare's Sonnets: The Problems Solved\", A. L. Rowse notes that Sonnet 138 shows the \"uncompromising realism with which he [Shakespeare] describes it all: it has been said -- rightly-- that there is no woman like Shakespeare's in all the sonnet-literature of the Renaissance. Most of them are abstractions or wraiths; this one is of flesh and blood\".",

In Sonnet 78 we find out about a rival who is male and a poet and whose entry initiates an episode of jealousy that comes to a close in only Sonnet 86 These sonnets are considered to be the Rival Poet sonnets. The rival poet sonnets include three primary players; the fair youth, the rival poet, and the lady who is desired by both men. The identities of these three players have been a controversy for hundreds of years and many experts disagree on the personage of the fair youth, rival poet, and lady.  The author Joseph Pequigney discusses the historic background of the rival poet, fair youth, and lady and states, \"The rival poet referred to in Sonnet 78 to 86, (a) are wholly fictitious, or (b) are depictions of real but unknown persons, or (c) admit of historical identifications. In the case of (c) speculation centers mostly on the youth who is surmised to be either the earl of Southampton or the earl of Pembroke or, occasionally, some other nobleman. Marlowe and Chapman are the leading candidates for the role of the literary rival, the lady has generally fared less well in generating a historical counterpart. Regardless of whether the incidents and interpersonal transactions rendered are actual or imaginary, everything comes through as uncertain or indistinct because the Quarto, unauthorized and unsupervised by Shakespeare, (a) prints the Sonnets in a version to be understood as disarranged to a greater or lesser extent, or (b) the order of the poems in Q must be accepted in lieu of more satisfactory alternative, or (c) the lost original order may be reconstructed by acute transpositions.\" As with the fair youth there is some debate over the personage of the rival poet. Other experts disagree with Pequigney's assessment and another expert stated, \"Among biographically minded commentators, a favourite candidate for Rival Poet has been Christopher Marlowe\".  The author R.J.C. Wait believes that the youth is none other than the Earl of Southampton. Waits states, \"Shakespeare now clearly recognizes that Southampton is giving assistance to one or more rivals\". Another perspective is given by the author Macd. P. Jackson who states, \"There can be no simple equation of a figure in Shakespeare's sonnets with a historical, biological personage.\" Waits argues that there are too many similarities for the fair youth to be anyone other than the Earl of Southampton, who was a known patron of the arts. The controversy around the identities of the fair youth, rival poet(s), and lady are an age old argument and may never be resolved as Shakespeare never explicitly identifies the individuals in the Sonnets.",

According to Jim Samson in Moniuszko's Grove Music entry, \"Like Glinka in Russia, Erkel in Hungary, and Smetana in the Czech lands, Moniuszko has become associated above all with the concept of a national style in opera.\" Moniuszko's opera and music as a whole is representative of 19th century romanticism, given the extensive use by the composer of arias, recitatives and ensembles that feature strongly in his operas. An exception is \"Straszny Dw\u00f3r\" (The Haunted Manor), where beautifully scored choral parts testify to Moniuszko's mastery of writing for many voices. The source of Moniuszko's melodies and rhythmic patterns often lies in Polish musical folklore. One of the most visibly \"Polish\" aspects of his music is in the forms he uses, including dances popular among upper classes such as polonaise and mazurka, and folk tunes and dances such as kujawiak and krakowiak. The most notable among his choral works are cantatas \"Sonety krymskie\" (Crimean Sonnets) and \"Widma\" (Phantoms), composed to the texts of Adam Mickiewicz, the leading poet of the Polish Romanticism. The melodic line of the former is particularly expressive and in parts of the composition takes on the form of variations.",

The sonnet is divided up into four quatrain, groups of four lines, and a couplet. Sonnet 56 is puzzling because of its seemingly inappropriate placement next to Sonnet 55. In Sonnet 55, the poet's relationship with the young man is steady and secure, but here there is a sudden shift from confidence to deep insecurity. In this sonnet the poet examines the \"quality of love.\" It is not clear whose love is being addressed. The poet's, \"his friend's, or that of both?\" The poet \"pleads for the love to be charged with fresh vigor.\" At the same time, the poet suggests that a \"separation\" may be what the relationship needs in order to \"renew the intensity of their devotion.\" It should noted that the identity of the \"Sweet love\" is not located in the poem and the ultimate fate of the relationship is left ambiguous. Although, there may be clues of their fate in the rest of the Fair You Sonnets. Shakespeare also uses metaphors for eating to talk about a sexual appetite.",

The rivalry between the poets may appear to be literary, but, according to the critic Joseph Pequigney, it is in reality a sexual rivalry. This is disturbing because the subject in the sonnet is one that the persona has found erotically profitable, in part because the other poet may be superior in learning and style. Shakespeare is not concerned with poetic triumph he is vying only for the prize of a fair friend. The combat between the two rivals is indirect and the speaker never addresses his literary adversary and only mentions his beloved. It is the body language of Sonnet 78 (the first in the series) 79, 80 and 84 that serves to convert the topic of letters into that of eroticism. Shakespeare is known for his usage of puns and double meaning on words. So it isn't surprising that he uses wordplay in the first quatrain on \"pen\" for the male appendage, or, as a Stein-cum-Joyce might say, \"a pen is a penis a pen,\" is fully utilized. The poet remarks at 78.4, \"every alien pen hath got my use,\" where \"alien\" = 'of a stranger' and \"use,\" besides 'literary practice,' can = 'carnal enjoyment.' These sexual allusions are made in passing; they are overtones, restricted to a line or two.",

He also wrote the first Polish poem in ottava rima, and was an early adopter of the Sapphic stanza in Polish poetry. His best-known poem is a sonnet (based on one of Fiamma's) similar to Philip Sidney's Sonnet 89 from \"Astrophel and Stella\" (\"Now that of absence the most irksome night\"), with the use of epistrophe (repetition of end-words) instead of rhyme.",

There were words that identified what we would consider to be homosexual behaviour, but the idea of a \"gay culture\" or \"gay identity\" did not exist. Charles goes on to say that early modern laws against sodomy had very few transgressors, which means that either people did not engage in homosexual behavior or these acts were more socially acceptable than the modern reader would think.
