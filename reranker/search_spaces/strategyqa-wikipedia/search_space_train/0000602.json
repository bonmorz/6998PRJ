With the escalating situation in Southeast Asia, 28 B-52Fs were fitted with external racks for 24\u00d7 750\u00a0lb (340\u00a0kg) bombs under project \"South Bay\" in June 1964; an additional 46 aircraft received similar modifications under project \"Sun Bath\". In March 1965, the United States commenced Operation Rolling Thunder. The first combat mission, Operation Arc Light, was flown by B-52Fs on 18 June 1965, when 30 bombers of the 9th and 441st Bombardment Squadrons struck a communist stronghold near the B\u1ebfn C\u00e1t District in South Vietnam. The first wave of bombers arrived too early at a designated rendezvous point, and while maneuvering to maintain station, two B-52s collided, which resulted in the loss of both bombers and eight crewmen. The remaining bombers, minus one more that turned back due to mechanical problems, continued toward the target. Twenty-seven Stratofortresses dropped on a one-mile by two-mile target box from between 19,000 and 22,000\u00a0feet, a little more than 50% of the bombs falling within the target zone. The force returned to Andersen AFB except for one bomber with electrical problems that recovered to Clark AFB, the mission having lasted 13 hours. Post-strike assessment by teams of South Vietnamese troops with American advisors found evidence that the Viet Cong had departed the area before the raid, and it was suspected that infiltration of the south's forces may have tipped off the north because of the South Vietnamese Army troops involved in the post-strike inspection. Beginning in late 1965, a number of B-52Ds underwent \"Big Belly\" modifications to increase bomb capacity for carpet bombings. While the external payload remained at 24 of 500\u00a0lb (227\u00a0kg) or 750\u00a0lb (340\u00a0kg) bombs, the internal capacity increased from 27 to 84 for 500\u00a0lb bombs, or from 27 to 42 for 750\u00a0lb bombs. The modification created enough capacity for a total of 60,000\u00a0lb (27,215\u00a0kg) using 108 bombs. Thus modified, B-52Ds could carry 22,000\u00a0lb (9,980\u00a0kg) more than B-52Fs. Designed to replace B-52Fs, modified B-52Ds entered combat in April 1966 flying from Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. Each bombing mission lasted 10 to 12 hours and included an aerial refueling by KC-135 Stratotankers. In spring 1967, B-52s began flying from U Tapao Airfield in Thailand so that refueling was not required. On 22 November 1972, a B-52D (55-0110) from U-Tapao was hit by a surface-to-air missile (SAM) while on a raid over Vinh. The crew was forced to abandon the damaged aircraft over Thailand. This was the first B-52 destroyed by hostile fire. In total, 31 B-52s were lost during the war, which included 10 B-52s shot down over North Vietnam.",

Live performances of the first 3 tracks (as well as other tracks from other AC/DC albums) on the album were filmed at the band's Maryland shows on 20 and 21 December 1981 were used as promotional material and seen on many music channels around this period as well as some today. The live version of \"Back In Black\" and \"T.N.T\" from this show were released as B sides to \"Let's Get It Up\" and the live version of \"Let There Be Rock\" was the B-side to \"For Those About To Rock\". All 3 previously B-side only releases were issued as part of AC/DC's \"Backtracks\" box set in late 2009 and on iTunes on 19 November 2012. According to the official AC/DC website, the second track is \"Put the Finger on You\". On some versions of the album the title is shown as \"I Put the Finger on You\". In Spain, early copies of the album featured a sleeve with the colours reversed, i.e. a gold cannon on a black background. After the album's release, the band embarked on its first arena tour of North America, in late 1981 through early 1982. For the title track, large cannons were placed on stage, set to go off in accordance with the song on the album. During the tour, 100,000 watts of power were used for the front of house sound. The cannons were flown above the speaker arrays. The title track's popularity was such that in almost every live concert AC/DC has done thereafter, the song is performed as an encore and is always accompanied by firing cannons on stage. Subsequent tours had to deal with crossing international borders with big cannons used as a prop, creating strange situations with customs officials.",

In 1996, the General Accounting Office (GAO) disclosed that the USAF's B-2 bombers \"will be, by far, the most costly bombers to operate on a per aircraft basis\", costing over three times as much as the B-1B (US$9.6\u00a0million annually) and over four times as much as the B-52H (US$6.8\u00a0million annually). In September 1997, each hour of B-2 flight necessitated 119 hours of maintenance in turn. Comparable maintenance needs for the B-52 and the B-1B are 53 and 60 hours respectively for each hour of flight. A key reason for this cost is the provision of air-conditioned hangars large enough for the bomber's wingspan, which are needed to maintain the aircraft's stealthy properties, particularly its \"low-observable\" stealthy skins. Maintenance costs are about $3.4\u00a0million a month for each aircraft.",

However, in 1997, it was modified to carry only conventional payloads. The B-1 Lancer is no longer used to deliver nuclear payloads. Currently, 76 B-52H bombers are maintained at bases in Barksdale, Louisiana, and Minot, North Dakota. Along with these, 20 B-2 bombers are in service at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. The United States Air Force is in the process of integrating a new long range bomber, the B-21 Raider, into service. This aircraft is scheduled to begin service in 2025. The B-21 will contribute to even greater capabilities for the US nuclear armada. It will allow for a larger and more diverse payload that includes current and future weapons. It will allow for increased range compared to the B-1, 2, and 52. The range capabilities of the B-21 are currently classified and are not expected to be released. The B-21 will also cost significantly less than the B-2 bomber. In 1997, the average cost of a B-2 was $737 million. The projected average cost for the B-21 Raider is $550 million per plane.",
