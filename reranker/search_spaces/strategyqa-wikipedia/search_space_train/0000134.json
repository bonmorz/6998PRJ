Stewie decides to spend the whole day with the cast, which includes stealing Cleveland's van, having lunch at McDonald's, going bowling, and going to a carnival. However, they complain about minor things and greatly annoy Stewie, who beams everyone back after stating that they have ruined \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" for him, and that he hopes they all die.",
