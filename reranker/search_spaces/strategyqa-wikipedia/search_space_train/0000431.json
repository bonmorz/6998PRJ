In 1992, Nine Inch Nails relocated to 10050 Cielo Drive, Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles (renamed \"Le Pig\" by Reznor), the site of the Tate murders, when Charles Manson's \"family\" murdered Sharon Tate, wife of noted film director Roman Polanski, and four of her friends. It was used for the band to record \"Broken\", an extended play (EP) that was the first Nine Inch Nails release distributed by Interscope Records and reached the top 10 on the \"Billboard\" 200. In the liner notes, Reznor credited the 1991 Nine Inch Nails touring band as an influence on the EP's sound. He characterized \"Broken\" as a guitar-based \"blast of destruction\", and as \"a lot harder\u00a0... than \"Pretty Hate Machine\"\". The inspiration for the harder sound came from the way the live band played during concerts such as Lollapalooza. Songs from \"Broken\" earned Nine Inch Nails two Grammy Awards: a performance of the EP's first single \"Happiness in Slavery\" from Woodstock '94, and the second single \"Wish\". In reference to receiving the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for \"Wish\", Reznor joked that \"Wish\" became \"the only to ever win a Grammy that says 'fist fuck' in the lyrics.\" Against touring of the brand new material, Reznor began living and recording full-time at Le Pig, working on a follow-up free of restrictions from his record label.",

Although, many loved Joss Stone, she did receive criticism and was questioned as a singer because of her background.

Although Otis Redding originally wrote the song, Joss Stone sampled Aretha Franklin's version instead. \"Headturner\" appeared on her third album, Introducing Joss Stone in 2007. She approached her song by taking the texture and sound of Franklin's song, but keeping her own composition. Aretha's version became an icon for the feminist movement, demanding for a little respect. Stone's version also portrayed the same message, as well as expressing self-confidence and a little bit of sass. Stone was inspired and highly influenced by Aretha Franklin. She would mimic Franklin's singing style growing up. Stone has such an amazing voice that her \"soulful vocals have seen her described as 'the white Aretha Franklin'\". In fact, Stone reached out to Franklin to sing one of her written songs and Franklin agreed to do it, but Stone believed the contract conditions were too impeding. Although, many loved Joss Stone, she did receive criticism and was questioned as a singer because of her background. Her audience expected soul artists to have been born in poverty and have had a rough and painful life in order to sing soul music because of how emotional it is; people also expected someone with a voice like Stone's to be black.",

            "document": "Nine Inch Nails . There are several music genres Nine Inch Nails has been described as, including alternative rock, industrial rock, industrial dance, industrial, electro-industrial, industrial metal, and electronic rock. AllMusic's Steve Huey states that \"Nine Inch Nails were the most popular industrial group ever and were largely responsible for bringing the music to a mass audience\". Reznor has never referred to his own work as industrial music, but admits to borrowing techniques from such early industrial bands as Throbbing Gristle and Test Dept. Despite the disparity between those artists initially operating under the term \"industrial\" and Nine Inch Nails, it has become common in journalistic descriptions of Reznor's body of work to describe it as such. Reznor acknowledged in \"Spin\" magazine that \"Down in It\" was influenced by early Skinny Puppy, particularly the band's song \"Dig It\"; other songs from \"Pretty Hate Machine\" and \"With Teeth\" have been described as synth-pop. Reviewing \"The Fragile\", critic Steve Cooper noted that the album juxtaposes widely varied genres, such as solo piano in \"The Frail\" and drum and bass elements in \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" Ambient music has been featured in some of Nine Inch Nails' music, including on \"Ghosts I\u2013IV\" (which is specifically dark ambient), \"Hesitation Marks\", \"The Downward Spiral\", \"The Slip\", and \"The Fragile\". Certain techniques and styles can be found throughout Nine Inch Nails' catalog. Songs such as \"Wish\", and \"The Day the World Went Away\" exhibit terraced dynamics. Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from whispers to screams. He also has used software to alter his voice in several songs, as evident in \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" and \"Burn\". The band's music also occasionally contains complex time signatures, notably in \"The Collector\", from \"With Teeth\", and concert favorite \"March of the Pigs\". Reznor regularly uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements, and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody and/or harmony. These techniques are all used in the song \"Hurt\", which contains a highly dissonant tritone played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word \"I\" every time the B/E# dyad is played. \"Closer\" concludes with a chromatic piano motif: The melody is debuted during the second verse of \"Piggy\" on organ, then reappears in power chords at drop D tuning throughout the chorus of \"Heresy\", while an inverted (ascending) version is used throughout \"A Warm Place\", and then recurs in its original state for the final time on \"The Downward Spiral\". On \"The Fragile\", Reznor revisits this technique of repeating a motif multiple times throughout different songs, either on a different musical instrument, with a transposed harmony, or in an altered tempo. Many of the songs on \"Year Zero\" contain an extended instrumental ending, which encompasses the entire second half of the three-minute long \"The Great Destroyer\". Allmusic's review described the album's laptop-mixed sound: \"guitars squall against glitches, beeps, pops, and blotches of blurry sonic attacks. Percussion looms large, distorted, organic, looped, screwed, spindled and broken.\"",
