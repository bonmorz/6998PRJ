The square hole in the middle of cash coins served to allow for them to be strung together in strings of 1000 cash coins and valued at 1 tael of silver (but variants of regional standards as low as 500 cash coins per string also existed), 1000 coins strung together were referred to as a \"chu\u00e0n\" (\u4e32) or \"di\u00e0o\" (\u540a) and were accepted by traders and merchants per string because counting the individual coins would cost too much time. Because the strings were often accepted without being checked for damaged coins and coins of inferior quality and copper-allots these strings would eventually be accepted based on their nominal value rather than their weight, this system is comparable to that of a fiat currency. Because the counting and stringing together of cash coins was such a time consuming task people known as \"qi\u00e1np\u00f9\" (\u9322\u92ea) would string cash coins together in strings of 100 coins of which ten wouldn form a single \"chu\u00e0n\". The \"qi\u00e1np\u00f9\" would receive payment for their services in the form of taking a few cash coins from every string they composed, because of this a \"chu\u00e0n\" was more likely to consist of 990 coins rather than 1000 coins and because the profession of \"qi\u00e1np\u00f9\" had become a universally accepted practice these \"chu\u00e0ns\" were often still nominally valued at 1000 cash coins. The number of coins in a single string was locally determined as in one district a string could consist of 980 cash coins, while in another district this could only be 965 cash coins, these numbers were based on the local salaries of the \"qi\u00e1np\u00f9\". During the Qing dynasty the \"qi\u00e1np\u00f9\" would often search for older and rarer coins to sell these to coin collectors at a higher price.",

Some Chinese cash coins were known to display features commonly seen in Chinese numismatic charms, Chinese coins with charm features have been created over two thousand years ago with the early Ban Liang and Wu Zhu cash coins, and when the first Chinese charms started appearing during the Han dynasty these coins were already commonplace. Many government issued cash coins and other currencies such as Spade and Knife money that did not have any extra charm-like features were considered to also have \u201ccharm-like qualities\u201d and were treated as charms by some people. The Wang Mang era Knife coin with a nominal value of 5,000 cash coins was often seen as a charm by the people because the character (or 1000) is written very similar to the character which means \"son\" so the inscription of the Knife coin could be read as \"worth five sons\" as this was very much desired in ancient Chinese society. A coin from Shu Han with the nominal value of 100 Wu Zhu cash coins featured a fish on the reverse of the inscription which symbolises \"abundance\" and \"perseverance\" in Chinese culture. Another Shu Han era coin contained the inscription of Tai Ping Bai Qian which was taken as an omen of peace and this coin is often considered to be a peace charm. During the Jin dynasty a coin was issued with the inscription \"f\u0113ng hu\u00f2\" (\u8c50\u8ca8) which could be translated as \"(the) coin of abundance\" and it was believed by the people at the time that if someone would possess this coin that this would be economically beneficial for them which is why this coin is commonly referred to as the \"cash of riches\" in popular tongue. During the Tang dynasty period images of clouds, crescents, and stars were often added on coins which the Chinese continued to use in subsequent dynasties. During the Jurchen Jin dynasty coins were cast with reverse inscriptions that featured characters from the twelve earthly branches and ten heavenly stems. During the Ming dynasty stars were sometimes used decoratively on some official government produced cash coins. Under the Manchu Qing dynasty \"y\u014dng zh\u00e8ng t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" (\u96cd\u6b63\u901a\u5bf6) cash coins cast by the Lanzhou Mint were considered to be charms or amulets capable of warding off evil spirits and demons because the Manchu word \"gung\" looked similar to the broadsword used by the Chinese God of War, Emperor Guan. The commemorative \"k\u0101ng x\u012b t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" (\u5eb7\u7199\u901a\u5bf6) cast for the Kangxi Emperor's 60th birthday in the year 1713 was believed to have \"the powers of a charm\" immediately when it entered circulation, this commemorative coin vontains a slightly different version of the Hanzi symbol \"\", at the bottom of the cash, as this character would most commonly have a vertical line at the left part of it but did not have it, and the part of this symbol which was usually inscripted as \"\" has the middle part written as a \"\" instead. Notably, the upper left area of the symbol \"\" only contains a single dot as opposed of the usual two dots used during this era. Several myths were attributed to this coin over the following three-hundred years since it has been cast such as the myth that the coin was cast from molten down golden statues of the 18 disciples of the Buddha which earned this coin the nicknames \"the Lohan coin\" and \"Arhat money\". These commemorative \"k\u0101ng x\u012b t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" cash coins were given to children as \"y\u0101 su\u00ec qi\u00e1n\" (\u58d3\u6b72\u9322) during Chinese new year, some women wore them akin to how an engagement ring is worn today, and in rural Shanxi young men wore this special \"k\u0101ng x\u012b t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" cash coin between their teeth like men from cities had golden teeth.

This system had been used in ancient India since the time of the Mahajanapadas. The exact ratio in value of the three metals varied greatly in different eras and places; for example, the opening of silver mines in the Harz mountains of central Europe made silver relatively less valuable, as did the flood of New World silver after the Spanish conquests. However, the rarity of gold consistently made it more valuable than silver, and likewise silver was consistently worth more than copper.",

The city very often placed the image of its patron saint on its coins. The date came to be stamped on coins that were struck during the vacancies of the Holy See, occasionally at first, and later as a rule; it rarely appears on other coins before 1550; the practice became general in the seventeenth century, the year of the Christian era or that of the pontificate being used; and Gregory XVI established it by law, as also the requirement that each coin should bear upon it an expression of its value. At Bologna as early as the seventeenth century, the value of gold or silver coins was usually indicated with the figures 20, 40, 80, etc., i.e. so many bolognini or baiocchi; at Rome, in the eighteenth century, nearly all the copper coins bore an indication of their value. The rim of papal coins rarely bore an inscription; at most, the monogram of the city in which the coin was struck was stamped upon it. From the sixteenth century, the engravers, also, put their ciphers on the coins; among these engravers may be named Benvenuto Cellini, Francesco Raibolini, called il Francia (Bologna), the four Hamerani, Giulio Romano (trident), Cavaliere Lucenti, Andrea Perpenti etc. Until the time of Pius VI, the dies for the mint remained the property of the engravers.",

Rapid increases in quantity of the money or in the overall money supply (or debasement of the means of exchange) have occurred in many different societies throughout history, changing with different forms of money used. For instance, when gold was used as currency, the government could collect gold coins, melt them down, mix them with other metals such as silver, copper, or lead, and reissue them at the same nominal value. By diluting the gold with other metals, the government could issue more coins without increasing the amount of gold used to make them. When the cost of each coin is lowered in this way, the government profits from an increase in seigniorage. This practice would increase the money supply but at the same time the relative value of each coin would be lowered.

The omission of the motto \"In God We Trust\" on the Indian Head eagle coin caused public outrage, and prompted Congress to pass a bill mandating its inclusion. Mint Chief Engraver Charles E.

Various official coin inscriptions already have very auspicious meanings which is also why these inscriptions were selected to be used on Chinese numismatic charms and amulets, during times of crisis and disunity such as under the reign of Wang Mang the number of charms with coin inscriptions seem to increase enormously. Meanwhile, other Chinese cash coin inscriptions were selected due to a perceived force in the metal used in the casting of these contemporary cash coins, an example would be the Later Zhou dynasty era \"zh\u014du yu\u00e1n t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" (\u5468\u5143\u901a\u5bf6) charm based on cash coins with the same inscription.

Northern Song dynasty era charms may have been based on actual Mother coins that were used to produce the official cash coins produced by the government but were given different reverses to make them into charms. During the Ming dynasty there were Chinese charms based on the \"h\u00f3ng w\u01d4 t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" (\u6d2a\u6b66\u901a\u5bf6) with an image of a boy (or possible the Emperor) riding either an ox or water buffalo, this charm became very popular as the first Emperor of the Ming dynasty was born as a peasant and spent his early life as one and eventually attained the title of Emperor which inspired many people that they could also do great things despite their lowly birth. There were also a large number of Chinese numismatic charms cast with the reign title Zheng De (\u6b63\u5fb7\u901a\u5bf6), despite the government having deprecated cash coins for paper money at the time and these charms were often given to children as gifts.

In the early years of the reign of King Charles II (1660\u20131685), there was a clear need for low-denomination coins to fund day-to-day purchases. The silver 1d and 2d coins issued in the first few years of the reign were being hoarded, and tradesmen in many parts of the country had taken to issuing private tokens in base metal; while this was an offence, in practice penalties were minimal and the government appreciated the need for such coinage which was not available legally. A problem with the production of low-value coins is that if the face value is less than the cost of production (including the metal) then the exercise is done at a loss and the coins may be clipped or melted down for their metal content; if the face value is higher, counterfeit coins begin to appear. The Mint was not ready to produce copper coins until 1672; by that time Maundy-type small silver (1d\u20134d) coins were being produced and were circulating widely, so no copper pennies were produced, although a Royal Proclamation in August 1672 decreed that halfpennies and farthings would be issued, and that they would have a face value equal to the value of the metal less the cost of producing them. The new coins were legal tender up to a total value of six pence, and depicted Britannia (modelled by the Duchess of Richmond) on the reverse. It was soon discovered that the Mint was incapable of producing the copper blanks needed for the new coins, and these eventually were imported from Sweden; to facilitate the process, the Customs Duty on the import of the metal was waived. Further delays ensued, caused not least by transportation problems, and the first halfpennies did not appear in circulation until after Christmas (the year did not end until 24 March in those days, so there were still three months before the start of 1673).",

The \"\u0110\u1ed3ng Sao\" series of cash coins was introduced as zinc cash coins were heavy in quantity to carry around for the payment of larger sums of money, to this end the government introduced a system of monetary units determined by their nominal value in zinc cash coins as opposed to their intrinsic market value, it is possible that this might have been inspired by contemporary Chinese coinage of the Xianfeng era in the Qing dynasty where large denomination coins from 4 up to 1000 v\u0103n circulated alongside each other with little to no difference in intrinsic value in a fiduciary system, this system was also used by the Vietnamese. When the T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao was first proposed the Mandarins of the imperial court of \u0110\u1ea1i Nam suggested to simply increase the weight of the brass T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u00f4ng B\u1ea3o to make them worth more relative to the zinc T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u00f4ng B\u1ea3o cash coins as 1 brass cash coin with a weight of 9 ph\u1ea7n was worth four zinc cash coins.

In January 1868 by decree the exchange rate between brass 9 ph\u1ea7n cash and zinc cash coins was fixed 1:4 replacing the early ratio of 1:2.67 that had been in place since 1858. The T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao was generally well received by the population of \u0110\u1ea1i Nam despite the fact that their circulation was reduced due to their high purchasing power relative to their intrinsic value until their weight was decreased, which was done by the government to conform to the new official exchange between brass and zinc cash coins.",

In 1834, it was dropped from most of the gold coins to mark the change in the standard fineness of the coins. In 1837, it was dropped from the silver coins, marking the era of the Revised Mint Code. An Act of February 12, 1873 made the inscription a requirement of law upon the coins of the United States. \"E pluribus unum\" appears on all coins currently being manufactured, including the Presidential dollars that started being produced in 2007, where it is inscribed on the edge along with \"In God We Trust\" and the year and mint mark. After the revolution, Rahway, New Jersey became the home of the first national mint to create a coin bearing the inscription \"E pluribus unum\".",

During the Warring states period Ban Liang coins from the State of Qin generally had 8 gram Ban Liang coins from between 32 and 34 millimeters in diameter, while during the Qin dynasty all Ban Liang coins generally had a weight of 6 grams and were about 31.7 millimeters in diameters. Han dynasty era Ban Liang coins are generally smaller than Qin Ban Liang coins, this is due to the Han dynasty government constantly changing weight standards for the coins many variants from that era exist.",

Seeing as the two original coins had a net value of under \u00a30.10 at the then-current exchange rate, this \"trick\" could net a profit when playing as the cost to play the machine had been reduced by over 90%. It did not take long for industry to reprogram the coin detectors to detect and reject the \"Austrian Schilling trick\". Not long after it was possible to buy on the Internet a bag of 100 washers for under \u00a320 that had been deliberately made to fool the machines into thinking they were \u00a31 coins. Again profits could be made, and again the industry reacted and coin detection devices were replaced with improved ones.",
