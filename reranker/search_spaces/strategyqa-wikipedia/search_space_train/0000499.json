Standard toppings on hamburgers may vary depending upon location, particularly at restaurants that are not national or regional franchises. A \"Texas burger\" uses mustard as the only sauce, and comes with or without vegetables, jalapeno slices, and cheese. In New Mexico and parts of the Southwest, green chile burgers are very common. In the Upper Midwest, particularly Wisconsin, burgers are often made with a buttered bun, butter as one of the ingredients of the patty, or with a pat of butter on top of the burger patty. This is called a \"Butter Burger\". In the Carolinas, a Carolina-style hamburger \"with everything\" may be served with cheese, chili, onions, mustard, and coleslaw. National hamburger chain Wendy's sells a \"Carolina Classic\" burger with these toppings in these areas. In Hawaii, hamburgers are often topped with teriyaki sauce, derived from the Japanese-American culture, and locally grown pineapple. The Waffle House claims on its menus and website to offer 70,778,880 different ways of serving a hamburger. In areas of the Midwest and East Coast, a hamburger served with lettuce, tomato, and onion is called a \"California burger\". This usage is sufficiently widespread to appear on the menus of Dairy Queen. In the Western U.S., a \"California\" burger often denotes a cheeseburger with guacamole and bacon added. Pastrami burgers are particularly popular in Salt Lake City, Utah.",
