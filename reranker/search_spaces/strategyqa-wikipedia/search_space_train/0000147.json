On September 23, 2009, during his opening monologue, O'Brien told a very brief joke about Newark, and a supposed health care program for the city's citizens that would involve Newark giving them a bus ticket out of the city. Newark mayor Cory Booker responded in a satirical YouTube video calling for O'Brien to apologize, and that Conan would be banned from ever entering Newark Liberty International Airport until doing so. Conan responded by further making fun of Newark, however, saying the only way he could get to Newark now would be like everyone else, \"through a series of poor decisions.\" He also called out Cory Booker to come on the show to air out their grievances, deciding to then ban Booker from Burbank airport, adding later that he had absolutely no power to do so. Booker subsequently banned Conan from the state of New Jersey as well as all the sister cities of Newark. In response, O'Brien read a letter on air from Elizabeth, New Jersey mayor Chris Bollwage, declaring that he will temporarily rename Terminal A of Newark Liberty (which lies in Elizabeth) the Conan O'Brien Terminal. Conan continued, saying he had created a \"geographic toilet seat\" around Newark. The mayors of Bayonne, East Orange, Kearny, Jersey City, and Elizabeth have publicly sided with Conan O'Brien. He ended this by saying, \"Your move, Mayor Booker.\" The feud was unofficially ended when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for it to end during a prepared comedy bit, telling Booker to \"chalk it up\" to Conan. The following week Conan announced that Cory Booker would be a guest on the October 16, 2009 show to mend the feud. That night, O'Brien and his wife donated $50,000 to the Newark Now Organization, and NBC Universal matched Conan's donation to total a $100,000 gift. Booker also admitted that he is a big Conan fan and often tapes shows to watch the next day or watches them on the website Hulu.",

O'Brien's successful hosting job at the 2002 54th Primetime Emmy Awards \"sent out the most resounding message yet about his growing strength as a performer\", and a year later, NBC broadcast O'Brien's tenth anniversary special in primetime. By the time Leno's contract again came up for renewal, a discussion would be needed regarding the future of \"The Tonight Show\".

Over time, as the controversy has become more distant, formal acknowledgement of O'Brien's lengthy career at NBC has become more common by the network. In 2017, mention was made of the host in NBC's 90th Anniversary Special, and a display for him (along with all other former \"Tonight Show\" hosts) appears in the ride queue of the \"Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon\" theme park attraction at Universal Studios Florida. A plaque on the O'Brien display reads: In September 1993, Conan O'Brien made his television debut on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" after working as a writer on such television comedy institutions as \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons\". O'Brien's brand of irreverent humor proved to be a hit with the late night audience, including memorable sketches like \"If They Mated,\" \"In the Year 2000,\" and \"Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.\" In September 2004, on the 50th anniversary of \"The Tonight Show\", NBC announced that O'Brien would take over hosting duties from Jay Leno in 2009. While his time as host proved to be short-lived, O'Brien went on to launch a new late night talk show, \"Conan\", on TBS in November 2010. Conan O'Brien remains a true comedy innovator and, at almost 25 years on the air, has enjoyed one of the longest runs of any late night television host.",

On January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that \"The Jay Leno Show\" would be moved from the 10 p.m. Eastern time slot to 11:35\u00a0p.m. and \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" would be moved from 11:35\u00a0p.m. to 12:05\u00a0a.m. effective March 1, 2010, the first time in its history that the show would begin after midnight. On January 12, 2010, O'Brien publicly announced in an open letter that he intended to leave NBC if they moved \"The Tonight Show\" to anytime after midnight in order to accommodate moving \"The Jay Leno Show\" to 11:35\u00a0p.m. ET. He felt it would damage the show's legacy as it always started after the late local news since it began in 1954. After several days of negotiations, O'Brien reached a settlement with NBC that allowed him to leave \"The Tonight Show\" on January 22, 2010, ending his partnership with NBC after 22 years. Leno began his second tenure as host of \"The Tonight Show\" on March 1, 2010, after the 2010 Winter Olympics, but only after major controversy. Leno's second \"Tonight\" was taped at NBC's Studio 11 in Burbank, the former home of \"The Jay Leno Show\", with a modified version of that show's set. After leaving NBC, O'Brien began hosting his own late night talk show, \"Conan\", on TBS on November 8, 2010, after his non-compete clause had lapsed.",

This was accompanied by reports that Jay Leno had told Jeff Zucker, the President of NBC Entertainment, News & Cable Group, of his plans to retire that same year. Leno immediately explained on his show the following night that in having Conan take over the show, and announcing it years before the transition would take place, that he wanted to avoid the hardship that he had experienced in the dispute over retiring Johnny Carson's hosting duties between him and David Letterman in 1992. Further commenting about the announcement, Leno made it clear that Conan was \"certainly the most deserving person for the job.\" However, in 2008, while Leno was beginning to bring his show to a close, it was announced that Leno had changed his mind about retiring and would instead host a new prime-time variety show on NBC. \"The Jay Leno Show\" aired weeknights at 10:00\u00a0pm from September 14, 2009, until the show's cancellation on February 9, 2010.",

This episode was Chandrasekaran's second writing credit, having co-written the \"Winter Madness\" episode that aired on January 21, 2010. This was McCarthy-Miller's eleventh directed episode. \"Khonani\" originally aired in the United States on April 22, 2010, on NBC as the eighteenth episode of the show's fourth season and the 76th overall episode of the series. The main plot regarding the two janitors\u2014Subhas and Khonani\u2014battling for the late-night shift at 11:30\u00a0p.m. closely mirrored the feud between television hosts Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien over the hosting job of \"The Tonight Show\". Similar to the feud, in this \"30 Rock\" episode, Khonani signed a contract five years ago to take over the 11:30\u00a0p.m. from Subhas and asked Jack Donaghy to make it happen, which Jack does. In September 2004, it was announced by the NBC network that Jay Leno would be succeeded by Conan O'Brien in 2009 as host of \"The Tonight Show\". Five years later, Leno would host his final episode of \"The Tonight Show\" in May 2009; similarly, Jack informs Subhas that Khonani will take over that shift. Subhas is not thrilled with this, resulting in Jack moving Subhas to the 10:00 shift; O'Brien took over as host of \"The Tonight Show\" in June 2009. NBC, afraid of losing Leno to another network, gave him a new nightly prime time series, \"The Jay Leno Show\", which premiered in September 2009 at 10:00\u00a0p.m. In \"Khonani\", as he begins his shift, Khonani is unhappy as there is no trash to pick up as it already has been collected by Subhas. As a result, Subhas goes back to the 11:30 shift, and Khonani leaves NBC to continue his janitorial duties at Foxwoods Resort Casino. \"The Jay Leno Show\" debuted to good ratings, however, as the show continued it would garner low ratings, resulting in NBC proposing that the show air at 11:35\u00a0p.m. and that \"The Tonight Show\" be moved to 12:05. O'Brien, however, rejected the timeslot. In January 2010, O'Brien reached a deal with the network that would see him leave \"The Tonight Show\" on January 22, 2010, and two months later Leno returned as host of \"The Tonight Show\" on March 1, 2010. In April 2010, O'Brien signed a deal with the cable network TBS to host a new late-night talk show.",
