It is not quite self-delusion, but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a free-standing, independent agent, and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received. And this goes on all the time in Silicon Valley.\" Author Michael Shellenberger argued that \"in the case of Musk, it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness. And I think there is a business reason for it. They are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a long-term viable business, and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent.\" Shellenberger continues, \"we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful, a bit more humble.\" While journalist and author Jim Motavalli, who interviewed Musk for \"High Voltage\", his 2011 book about the electric vehicle industry, speculated that \"Elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner, and he doesn't want to see other people win because they get government money \u2013 I do think there is a tendency of people, once they have succeeded, to want to pull the ladder up after them.\"",

First, astrology has not progressed in that it has not been updated nor added any explanatory power since Ptolemy. Second, it has ignored outstanding problems such as the precession of equinoxes in astronomy. Third, alternative theories of personality and behavior have grown progressively to encompass explanations of phenomena which astrology statically attributes to heavenly forces. Fourth, astrologers have remained uninterested in furthering the theory to deal with outstanding problems or in critically evaluating the theory in relation to other theories. Thagard intended this criterion to be extended to areas other than astrology. He believed it would delineate as pseudoscientific such practices as witchcraft and pyramidology, while leaving physics, chemistry and biology in the realm of science. Biorhythms, which like astrology relied uncritically on birth dates, did not meet the criterion of pseudoscience at the time because there were no alternative explanations for the same observations. The use of this criterion has the consequence that a theory can be scientific at one time and pseudoscientific at a later time.",

If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically, there are only four fundamental forces (conventionally), limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms.

Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances. Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude, the sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note, but astrology isn't based just off the sun alone. While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force, this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of Electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force. If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics, that would be an extraordinary claim.

They said that the methods of astrologers conflicted with orthodox religious views of Islamic scholars, by suggesting that the Will of God can be known and predicted in advance. For example, Avicenna's 'Refutation against astrology', \"Ris\u0101la f\u012b ib\u1e6d\u0101l a\u1e25k\u0101m al-noj\u016bm\", argues against the practice of astrology while supporting the principle that planets may act as agents of divine causation. Avicenna considered that the movement of the planets influenced life on earth in a deterministic way, but argued against the possibility of determining the exact influence of the stars. Essentially, Avicenna did not deny the core dogma of astrology, but denied our ability to understand it to the extent that precise and fatalistic predictions could be made from it. Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292\u20131350), in his \"Miftah Dar al-SaCadah\", also used physical arguments in astronomy to question the practice of judicial astrology. He recognised that the stars are much larger than the planets, and argued: And if you astrologers answer that it is precisely because of this distance and smallness that their influences are negligible, then why is it that you claim a great influence for the smallest heavenly body, Mercury? Why is it that you have given an influence to al-Ra's and al-Dhanab, which are two imaginary points [ascending and descending nodes]?",

SpaceX: Within a few years after Elon Musk started SpaceX, he was able to sign billion-dollar contracts with NASA and he successfully persuaded NASA to use space vessels made by SpaceX to replace old space shuttles. In this case, 'salesmen' were not needed, as buyers would want speak to the CEO directly in a deal this large. Apart from advanced technology and price, political hurdles were an important issue for the deal. SpaceX and its 3,000 employees were mostly based in California, in contrast to the traditional U.S. aerospace industry of 500,000 people spread all over 50 states. Therefore, SpaceX faced pressure from members of Congress who did not want federal funds to leave their states. In order to overcome political hurdles and satisfy different stakeholders of the American aerospace industry, each deal took months or even longer to complete. As complex sales only need a few deals each year, Elon Musk focused on the most crucial people, in this case politicians.",
