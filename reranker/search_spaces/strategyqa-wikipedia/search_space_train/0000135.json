Goldsmith was rumoured to be creating the theme tune for \"Enterprise\", as although he did not typically work on television, because of his affiliation with the \"Star Trek\" franchise, when he talked of creating a new television theme it was presumed that it would be for this series. The franchise was known for typically using orchestral themes, but Berman said that the theme tune would be more \"contemporary\" than heard in previous series and a \"little hipper\". The theme was revealed to be a cover of the Rod Stewart single \"Faith of the Heart\", by British tenor Russell Watson. Stewart's song had originally appeared on the soundtrack to the 1998 film \"Patch Adams\". For the use in \"Enterprise\", it was retitled to \"Where My Heart Will Take Me\", but prompted a negative reaction from existing \"Star Trek\" fans. These included an online petition to have the song removed, and there was a protest held outside of Paramount Studios. Executive producers Braga and Berman both defended the choice, with Berman saying that the fan response was split over the song while Braga said that some people found the song \"uplifting\". It was remixed for the third season, most notably with a new guitar track and fewer backing vocals. The song was not used on episodes 18 and 19 of series four (In a Mirror, Darkly Parts 1 and 2), nor were the usual introductory images. The images were much more warlike than the examples in the regular opening titles.",
