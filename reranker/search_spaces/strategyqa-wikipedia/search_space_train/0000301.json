However, it is very effective as a fighter could quickly dislocate their opponents joints or knock them out with a choke-hold if they choose to. The injury rate is around 9.2-38.6 per 1000 athlete exposures. This is lower than in Mixed martial arts (236-286 per 1000), boxing (210-420 per 1000), judo (25.3-130.6) and Taekwondo (20.5-139.5). It is similar to wrestling which also uses grappling instead of striking; the few injuries that may be incurred in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu usually affect the joints and rarely the head. The most common injuries Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioners suffer from are ACL tears in the knees, rotator cuff tears in the shoulders and spinal disc herniations, most commonly in the neck region. They are all repairable via surgery that has an extended rehab period before the athlete can return to BJJ training. Also many athletes suffer from less minor injuries, such as elbow and wrist tendonitis, due to overtraining and the grappling nature of the martial art, which can be strenuous and taxing for the joints and the tendons.",

While other businesses and companies tend to focus on the sporting aspect of BJJ, the Gracie's maintain a strict way of training that is primarily self-defense.
