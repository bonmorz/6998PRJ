In 1992, Nine Inch Nails relocated to 10050 Cielo Drive, Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles (renamed \"Le Pig\" by Reznor), the site of the Tate murders, when Charles Manson's \"family\" murdered Sharon Tate, wife of noted film director Roman Polanski, and four of her friends. It was used for the band to record \"Broken\", an extended play (EP) that was the first Nine Inch Nails release distributed by Interscope Records and reached the top 10 on the \"Billboard\" 200. In the liner notes, Reznor credited the 1991 Nine Inch Nails touring band as an influence on the EP's sound. He characterized \"Broken\" as a guitar-based \"blast of destruction\", and as \"a lot harder\u00a0... than \"Pretty Hate Machine\"\". The inspiration for the harder sound came from the way the live band played during concerts such as Lollapalooza. Songs from \"Broken\" earned Nine Inch Nails two Grammy Awards: a performance of the EP's first single \"Happiness in Slavery\" from Woodstock '94, and the second single \"Wish\". In reference to receiving the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for \"Wish\", Reznor joked that \"Wish\" became \"the only to ever win a Grammy that says 'fist fuck' in the lyrics.\" Against touring of the brand new material, Reznor began living and recording full-time at Le Pig, working on a follow-up free of restrictions from his record label.",

In fact, Stone reached out to Franklin to sing one of her written songs and Franklin agreed to do it, but Stone believed the contract conditions were too impeding. Although, many loved Joss Stone, she did receive criticism and was questioned as a singer because of her background.

Despite little mainstream airplay, several Skinny Puppy releases have charted in North America and Europe, and their influence on industrial and electronic music is considerable. Widely considered originators of a unique sound and live performance style, Skinny Puppy are also known as pioneers of industrial rock and electro-industrial, genres in which they may be seen to have spawned \"a litter of like-minded bands\". Their influence extends from independent acts like Tin Omen, to industrial rock stars Nine Inch Nails, who opened for Skinny Puppy for a short time on their 1988 North American tour. Trent Reznor also acknowledged that Skinny Puppy's \"Dig It\" inspired the very first Nine Inch Nails track written, \"Down in It\". Canadian synthpop artist Grimes includes Skinny Puppy as an influence on her music, having grown up in Vancouver's industrial music scene. Sara Taylor of the EBM group Youth Code has said that the song \"Worlock\" was \"one of the most influential songs\" she had ever heard. Other artists that have been impacted by Skinny Puppy's music include Marilyn Manson, Chester Bennington, 3Teeth, Foals vocalist Yannis Philippakis, Al Jourgensen, X Marks the Pedwalk, Wumpscut, Haujobb, Orgy, Filter, Front Line Assembly, Orphx, Crystal Castles, and Mayhem vocalist Attila Csihar.",

            "document": "Nine Inch Nails . There are several music genres Nine Inch Nails has been described as, including alternative rock, industrial rock, industrial dance, industrial, electro-industrial, industrial metal, and electronic rock. AllMusic's Steve Huey states that \"Nine Inch Nails were the most popular industrial group ever and were largely responsible for bringing the music to a mass audience\". Reznor has never referred to his own work as industrial music, but admits to borrowing techniques from such early industrial bands as Throbbing Gristle and Test Dept. Despite the disparity between those artists initially operating under the term \"industrial\" and Nine Inch Nails, it has become common in journalistic descriptions of Reznor's body of work to describe it as such. Reznor acknowledged in \"Spin\" magazine that \"Down in It\" was influenced by early Skinny Puppy, particularly the band's song \"Dig It\"; other songs from \"Pretty Hate Machine\" and \"With Teeth\" have been described as synth-pop. Reviewing \"The Fragile\", critic Steve Cooper noted that the album juxtaposes widely varied genres, such as solo piano in \"The Frail\" and drum and bass elements in \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" Ambient music has been featured in some of Nine Inch Nails' music, including on \"Ghosts I\u2013IV\" (which is specifically dark ambient), \"Hesitation Marks\", \"The Downward Spiral\", \"The Slip\", and \"The Fragile\". Certain techniques and styles can be found throughout Nine Inch Nails' catalog. Songs such as \"Wish\", and \"The Day the World Went Away\" exhibit terraced dynamics. Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from whispers to screams. He also has used software to alter his voice in several songs, as evident in \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" and \"Burn\". The band's music also occasionally contains complex time signatures, notably in \"The Collector\", from \"With Teeth\", and concert favorite \"March of the Pigs\". Reznor regularly uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements, and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody and/or harmony. These techniques are all used in the song \"Hurt\", which contains a highly dissonant tritone played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word \"I\" every time the B/E# dyad is played. \"Closer\" concludes with a chromatic piano motif: The melody is debuted during the second verse of \"Piggy\" on organ, then reappears in power chords at drop D tuning throughout the chorus of \"Heresy\", while an inverted (ascending) version is used throughout \"A Warm Place\", and then recurs in its original state for the final time on \"The Downward Spiral\". On \"The Fragile\", Reznor revisits this technique of repeating a motif multiple times throughout different songs, either on a different musical instrument, with a transposed harmony, or in an altered tempo. Many of the songs on \"Year Zero\" contain an extended instrumental ending, which encompasses the entire second half of the three-minute long \"The Great Destroyer\". Allmusic's review described the album's laptop-mixed sound: \"guitars squall against glitches, beeps, pops, and blotches of blurry sonic attacks. Percussion looms large, distorted, organic, looped, screwed, spindled and broken.\"",

            "document": "Nine Inch Nails . In 1987, Trent Reznor played keyboard in a Cleveland, Ohio band called the Exotic Birds, then managed by John Malm Jr. Reznor and Malm became friends, and when Reznor left the Exotic Birds to work on music of his own, Malm informally became his manager. At the time, Reznor was employed as an assistant engineer and janitor at Right Track Studios, in Cleveland; he asked studio owner Bart Koster for permission to record some demos of his own material for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed and allowed Reznor to use it whenever it was empty, commenting that it cost him \"just a little wear on [his] tape heads\". While completing the early recordings, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate the material as he desired. Instead, inspired by Prince, Reznor played all the instruments, except drums, himself. This role remains Reznor's on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians and assistants. Nine Inch Nails' debut was at the Phantasy Theater in Lakewood, Ohio on October 21, 1988 as part of the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series. In 1988, after playing its first shows supporting Skinny Puppy, Reznor's ambition for Nine Inch Nails was to release one 12-inch single on a small European label. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine selections from the Right Track demos recorded live in November 1988, collectively known as \"Purest Feeling\", were later released in revised form on the band's first full-length studio release, \"Pretty Hate Machine\" (1989). The overall sound on \"Purest Feeling\" is lighter than that of \"Pretty Hate Machine\"; several songs contain more live drumming and guitar work throughout, as well as a heavier use of samples from films.",
