The modern nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) electric vehicle battery was invented by Dr. Masahiko Oshitani, of the GS Yuasa Corporation, and Stanford Ovshinsky, the founder of the Ovonics Battery Company, and granted a patent. The current trend in the industry is towards the development of lithium-ion (Li-Ion) technology to replace NiMH in electric vehicles. In 2009, Toyota tested lithium batteries as a potential replacement for the nickel metal hydride batteries used in its Prius model gasoline-electric hybrid. The company said that it would continue to use NiMH batteries in the Prius, but would introduce an all-electric vehicle based on lithium technology. Li-Ion technology, while functionally superior due to its higher specific energy and specific power, it is more expensive and, as of 2009, relatively untested with regards to its long-term reliability. In 2007, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory said that Li-Ion batteries may be subject to dangerous overheating and fire if cells are controlled incorrectly or damaged. In 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigated the safety of lithium battery powered vehicles and concluded that they pose no more risk of fire than other vehicles.",

Lithium ion rechargeable battery cells are rather more sensitive to overcharging, overheating, improper charge levels during storage, and other forms of mistreatment than most commonly used battery chemistries. The reason is that the various lithium battery chemistries are susceptible to chemical damage (e.g., cathode fouling, molecular breakdown, etc.) by only very slight overvoltages (i.e., millivolts) during charging, or more charging current than the internal chemistry can tolerate at this point in its charge/discharge cycle, and so on. Heat accelerates these unwanted, but so far inescapable, chemical reactions and overheating during charging amplifies those effects. Because lithium chemistries often permit flexible membrane structures, lithium cells can be deployed in flexible though sealed bags, which permits higher packing densities within a battery pack. Some of the breakdown products (usually of electrolyte chemicals or additives) outgas when mistreated; such cells will become 'puffy' and are very much on the way to failure. In sealed lithium ion cylinders, the same outgassing has caused rather large pressures (800+ psi has been reported); such cells can explode if not provided with a relief failure mechanism. Compounding the danger is that many lithium cell chemistries include hydrocarbon chemicals (the exact nature of which is typically proprietary) which are flammable.

            "document": "Mitsubishi i-MiEV . In June 2011 Mitsubishi announced the introduction of lithium titanate oxide SCiB battery technology for its two new models of electric vehicles, the i-MiEV and Minicab MiEV. The SCiB technology was developed by Toshiba, which stated that its SCiB batteries can withstand 2.5 times more charge/discharge cycles than a typical lithium-ion battery. In addition, recharging via CHAdeMO takes much less time than charging at the AC Level 2 rate used by most electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), allowing the SCiB battery to reach 80% capacity in 15 minutes, 50% in 10 minutes and 25% in 5 minutes. In terms of performance, the SCiB battery offers a higher effective capacity than a typical lithium-ion battery, which combined with more efficient regenerative charging during braking or coasting downhill, allows the SCiB battery to deliver 1.7 times the driving range per charge of a typical lithium-ion battery of the same size. Alternatively, the carmaker could install a smaller battery with less weight and keep the same range to contribute to lower the vehicle price as compared to lithium-ion batteries. Recharging is estimated to take 14 hours from a 110 volt power supply, 7 hours from a 220 volt power supply and as little as 30 minutes from a quick charging station. The SCiB is available in the Japanese market. The U.S. has a more typical lithium ion battery.",

            "document": "Kuzhikalail M. Abraham . Dr. K.M. Abraham is a pioneer in the research and development of rechargeable lithium and lithium-ion batteries. His research to demonstrate a practical rechargeable lithium battery began in the late nineteen seventies when no such rechargeable batteries existed. He and his colleagues pursuant to the development of stable electrolytes to recharge the lithium electrode demonstrated one of the first sealed high capacity rechargeable lithium battery exhibiting several hundred charge/discharge cycles, a feat not accomplished until that time. This work was the forerunner to the commercially successful Li-ion batteries. Another contribution of Dr. Abraham and his colleagues involved the development of highly conductive gel polymer electrolytes and those supported on micro-porous polymer membranes. Today such separator-embedded gel polymer electrolytes are used to build the commercially successful lithium-ion polymer batteries. Other pioneering contributions of Dr. Abraham include rechargeable sodium battery chemical couples that operate at moderately high temperatures, the very high energy density non-aqueous lithium-sulfur battery, the ultrahigh energy density non-aqueous lithium-air battery, and the fundamental principles underlying the concept of chemical over charge protection of rechargeable lithium and Li-ion batteries. The research and development of lithium-air batteries is pursued world-wide for portable power, electric vehicles and large scale energy storage. His unique background encompasses both the fundamental science and engineering development of advanced batteries.",
