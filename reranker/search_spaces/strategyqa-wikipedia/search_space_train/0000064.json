The lower rank faculty members, who were sometimes detailed off to teach the introductory science courses at Radcliffe instead of teaching Harvard students, felt even more declasse.\" Marion Cannon Schlesinger,  Radcliffe Class of 1934, noted that \"there were, to be sure, certain professors who looked with horror at the incursions of women into the sacred precincts of Harvard College, even at the safe distance of the Radcliffe Yard, and would have nothing to do with the academic arrangements by which their colleagues taught the Radcliffe girls.

He first argued that Kantian ethics provides no specific information about what people should do because Kant's moral law is solely a principle of non-contradiction. He argued that Kant's ethics lack any content and so cannot constitute a supreme principle of morality. To illustrate this point, Hegel and his followers have presented a number of cases in which the Formula of Universal Law either provides no meaningful answer or gives an obviously wrong answer. Hegel used Kant's example of being trusted with another man's money to argue that Kant's Formula of Universal Law cannot determine whether a social system of property is a morally good thing, because either answer can entail contradictions. He also used the example of helping the poor: if everyone helped the poor, there would be no poor left to help, so beneficence would be impossible if universalised, making it immoral according to Kant's model. Hegel's second criticism was that Kant's ethics forces humans into an internal conflict between reason and desire. For Hegel, it is unnatural for humans to suppress their desire and subordinate it to reason. This means that, by not addressing the tension between self-interest and morality, Kant's ethics cannot give humans any reason to be moral.",

Javad Mirjavadov, Azerbaijani artist, a non-conformist and a reformer, whose masterpieces have had a tremendous influence on the development of contemporary Azerbaijani art. A turning point in his creative work came when he was a student and saw a reproduction of Paul Cezanne`s ``Mardi Gras``, experiencing creative regeneration. This passionate, dedicated and fearless man headed to Saint Petersburg to study the works of Cezanne, Van Gogh, Matisse and other outstanding artists of the 20th century. In order to fully grasp the enormous courage of this decision, we must recall that this happened during Stalin`s rule, when taking interest in these painters was considered heterodoxy and even treachery. Displaying the art of impressionists and post-impressionists was banned at the time and, though these works were stored in the Hermitage museum, they were considered anti-Soviet. Once Mirjavadov entered the office of Hermitage director Mikhail Artamonov and demanded: ``Show me Cezanne, or I will kill you!`` Artamonov replied, smiling: ``Why kill me, we will show you everything.`` Owing to a miraculous set of circumstances, Mirjavadov was allowed to enter the Hermitage repository, where he embraced with his whole being the paintings by El Greco, Rembrandt, Van Gogh and Cezanne. Later he asked the art gallery director why he had not called the police, but decided to help him instead, and Artamonov said: ``No one in the whole country needs this. But here you are, rushing in like the wind, a man from another land, and all you need is art and nothing else, just look at you!``",

Other popular feminist approaches to ethics include feminist ethics of care, and feminist postmodern ethics. The implementation of a feminist ethic of care often draws critique from feminist justice ethics. Feminist ethics of care is premised by the idea that morality is shaped by relational versions of our self. Our moral relations take precedence. Feminist justice ethics differs itself from feminist ethics of care by chastising such a perspective for its abandonment of universal values. In feminist justice ethics, legitimate ethical critique cannot be made without utilizing a universal set of ethics. Meanwhile, feminist postmodern ethics puts forth an entirely different view. A feminist postmodern perspective will perceive androcentricity in many aspects of life, including epistemology. At the same time feminist postmodernism will deny the existence of objectivity within our world. This claim is based on the notion that knowledge is subjectively constructed. One feminist postmodern scholar has implicated the ethical outcomes of modern business norms as a result of this masculine-dominated society. Friction between feminist justice ethics and feminist postmodern ethics exists on the principle of universality. The former supports the idea of universal values, while the latter denies such values exist because it denies objectivity. Since a universal view on morality is typical in feminist justice ethics, the question arises: what specific values are actually universal? Nussbaum's capabilities approach attempts to tackle this question, and lists several traits she believes to be universal:",

Ancient literature at the foundation of various Hindu traditions primarily discuss the first three, while the last has attracted greater attention since the 18th century. Some early 20th century literature wondered if ethics was ever a serious topic of study in Hinduism. Later studies have yielded the above four approaches to ethics in different schools of Hinduism, tied together with three common themes: (1) ethics is an essential part of dharma concept, (2) Ahimsa (non-violence) is the foundational premise without which - suggests Hinduism - ethics and any consistent ethical theory is impossible, and (3) Ethics cannot always be dualistically or non-dualistically reduced from first principles, ethics is closely related to moksha (self realization and spiritual freedom) with Vivekacudamani stating, \"individuals with self knowledge and spiritual freedom are inherently self examining and ethical\" and \"ethics, freedom and knowledge require each other\".

Raymer joined the faculty of Indiana University in 1995 and was promoted through the academic ranks from assistant, to associate, and finally to full professor based on the strength of his continued authorship of critically acclaimed non-fiction books of words and images on subjects ranging from Vietnam and Islam in Southeast Asia to the global Indian Diaspora and a profile of Calcutta. Raymer teaches classes in numerous sub-disciplines within the field of journalism such as media ethics and values, international newsgathering, reporting war and terrorism, and various classes in visual journalism. He also is an adjunct professor of the Dhar India Studies Program at Indiana University and associated with the Russia and East European Studies Institute, and remains a Professor of Journalism as of 2013, teaching classes in numerous sub-disciplines within the field of journalism such as media ethics and war/crisis reporting. During this time he authored several books. In his book Redeeming Calcutta, while the introduction lays the pitch for an effort at redemption, the photographs often betray the plan. For all his nuanced understanding of perceived notions, Raymer devotes around nine frames to the hand-drawn rickshaws or portraits of its pullers as an emphatic continuation of a Calcutta visual clich\u00e9. Some of the captions seem stretched, erroneous and irrelevant. A photograph of an elderly lady sitting on a rickshaw is explained as the lady being vulnerable to the toxic brew of vehicle exhausts, with the additional information that Calcutta is the air pollution capital of India, even though a 2011 World Health Organization survey found Ludhiana, Kanpur, Delhi, Lucknow and Indore to be more polluted. Yet another caption mentions that the most frequent users of the rickshaw are \u201cjust a notch above the truly poor\u201d\u2014a lazy assertion ripped from a 2008 \"National Geographic\" article by Calvin Trillin.",
