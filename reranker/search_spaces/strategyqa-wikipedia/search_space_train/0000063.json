Though many swords were double-edged for ease of cutting, this was not always the case.

It was mainly used for thrusting, however, and thus had limited effect when wielded from horseback. These swords were made with an iron blade to which a bronze-covered wood, or ivory cross guard, pommel, and grip would be attached. The gladius varied in length and size as Roman soldiers of different ranks used gladius measuring around 34.5 and 64 centimeters. There were other short sword variations that were classified with names other than \"gladius\". One such example is the \"sica\", which was about 40\u00a0cm long and had a curved tip.

At the end of certain levels, the barbarian has to fight a more powerful opponent called a boss. Defeating a boss involves a two-stage process: Conan has to inflict heavy damage on the creature and thus trigger an interactive button-pressing sequence that players have to complete to kill the boss. Several cycles of this process are required to defeat most bosses. Besides combat, button-pressing sequences are also used to interact with the environment, such as knocking down obstacles to create passageways, or as parts of platforming sequences in which Conan climbs walls and jumps from ledge to ledge. Players can save their progress by using special stones that are placed throughout the game. Conan starts each level with his default one-handed sword, and can pick up shields and other weapons to switch between three styles of attack: fighting with a one-handed weapon, a two-handed weapon, or a weapon in each hand. Each style features several attacks with names like \"Cimmerian Charge\" and \"Black River Rage\". The barbarian can change or stop his attacks at any time, creating many options in combat. When Conan lands a sequence of successive hits on his enemies, he activates his Song of Death, which increases the damage of his attacks for a short time. For defense, Conan can roll under enemy attacks or block them. If the player presses the block button just when an enemy is about to hit the barbarian, an image of a controller button appears on the screen.

Generally, battle would open with a volley of light \"pila\" from up to (and frequently far less), followed by a volley of heavy \"pila\" just before the clashing with \"scuta\" and \"gladii\". Roman soldiers were trained to stab with these swords instead of slash, always keeping their shields in front of them, maintaining a tight shield-wall formation with their fellow soldiers. To motivate the Roman soldier to come within two meters (6\u00a0ft) of his enemy (as he was required to do with the \"gladius\") he would be made a citizen after doing so, upon completion of his term of service. Roman infantry discipline was strict, and training constant and repetitive.",

The tenth century \"Sylloge Tacticorum\" gives the length of this kind of sword as the equivalent of 94\u00a0cm and mentions a new saber-like sword of the same length, the \"paramerion\", a curved one-edged slashing weapon for cavalrymen.

The most common was known as the javelin, a heavy spear that could be either thrown or thrusted. Similar in function to the javelin was the \"fuscina.\" Although not used by the Roman military, this fork-like trident was one of the most popular gladiator weapons. A version of the javelin that had a much longer and thinner tip was the \"pilum\", which could pierce armor or shields when thrown. Several \"pila\" could be thrown to initiate combat, disrupting the structure and defense of enemy armies and providing an opportunity for close combat, where the gladius would take over. The design of the \"pilum\" allowed it to become lodged in an enemy shield. Removing a \"pilum\" from a shield was often difficult and time consuming during combat. In fact, most were not reusable after removal.",

            "document": "Swordsmanship . Greece provides the foundation for the widespread use of the sword as a weapon in its own right in the West. The Roman legionaries and other forces of the Roman military, until the 2nd century A.D., used the gladius as a short thrusting sword effectively with the \"scutum\", a type of shield, in battle. Gladiators used a shorter gladius than the military. The spatha was a longer double-edged sword initially used only by Celtic soldiers, later incorporated as auxilia into Roman Cavalry units; however by the 2nd century A.D. the spatha was used throughout much of the Roman Empire. The Empire's legionary soldiers were heavily trained and prided themselves on their disciplinary skills. This probably carried over to their training with weaponry, but we have no Roman manuals of swordsmanship. One translation of Juvenal's poetry by Barten Holyday in 1661 makes note that the Roman trainees learned to fight with the wooden wasters before moving on to the use of sharpened steel. In fact, it is also found that Roman gladiators trained with a wooden sword, which was weighted with lead, against a straw man or a wooden pole known as a \"palus\" (an early relative of the later wooden \"pell\"). This training would have provided the Roman soldier with a good foundation of skill, to be improved upon from practical experience or further advanced training.",

After conditioning, the recruits underwent weapons training; this was deemed of such importance that weapons instructors generally received double rations. Legionaries were trained to thrust with their \"gladii\" because they could defend themselves behind their large shields (\"scuta\") while stabbing the enemy. These training exercises began with thrusting a wooden \"gladius\" and throwing wooden \"pila\" into a \"quintain\" (wooden dummy or stake) while wearing full armor. Their wooden swords and \"pila\" were designed to be twice as heavy as their metal counterparts so that the soldiers could wield a true \"gladius\" with ease. Next, soldiers progressed to \"armatura\", a term for sparring that was also used to describe the similar one-on-one training of gladiators. Unlike earlier training, the wooden weapons used for \"armatura\" were the same weight as the weapons they emulated. Vegetius notes that roofed halls were built to allow for these drills to continue throughout the winter.",

Knowledge about the arms and armour of the Viking age is based on archaeological finds, pictorial representation, and to some extent on the accounts in the Norse sagas and Norse laws recorded in the 13th century. According to custom, all free Norse men were required to own weapons and were permitted to carry them all the time. These arms were indicative of a Viking's social status: a wealthy Viking had a complete ensemble of a helmet, shield, mail shirt, and sword. However, swords were rarely used in battle, probably not sturdy enough for combat and most likely only used as symbolic or decorative items. A typical \"b\u00f3ndi\" (freeman) was more likely to fight with a spear and shield, and most also carried a seax as a utility knife and side-arm. Bows were used in the opening stages of land battles and at sea, but they tended to be considered less \"honourable\" than a melee weapon. Vikings were relatively unusual for the time in their use of axes as a main battle weapon. The H\u00fascarls, the elite guard of King Cnut (and later of King Harold II) were armed with two-handed axes that could split shields or metal helmets with ease.",

Each warrior has two weapons for each category (excluding special weapons), which players can select before each battle, both with their own different stats based on damage, speed, and injury type (piercing, slashing, and crushing). There are also two sets of armor to choose from, both providing varying levels of speed and defense from the three damage types.
