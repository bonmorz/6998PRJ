Inspired by the VAMP system developed by Elly Jessop at MIT's media lab, Heap set out to develop the musical gloves in collaboration with Thomas Mitchell, a lecturer in music systems at the University of the West of England, Bristol. The gloves combine sensors developed by 5DT, x-io Technologies with Shure microphones. Both Heap's and Elly Jessop's musical gloves are similar to The Lady's Glove, an earlier invention by the electronic sound pioneer Laetitia Sonami, and the midi gloves used since 1989 by Steve Hogarth lead singer of Marillion. While still in prototype stage, Heap used her MiMu gloves to record \"Me the Machine\", the first song created solely with the gloves. The song was released on her latest album, Sparks, originally titled \"heapsong11\". In an attempt to raise money for further research, Heap toured the song and the gloves at a number of venues and has been working with artists to discover the full potential of the gloves.",
