On September 23, 2009, during his opening monologue, O'Brien told a very brief joke about Newark, and a supposed health care program for the city's citizens that would involve Newark giving them a bus ticket out of the city. Newark mayor Cory Booker responded in a satirical YouTube video calling for O'Brien to apologize, and that Conan would be banned from ever entering Newark Liberty International Airport until doing so. Conan responded by further making fun of Newark, however, saying the only way he could get to Newark now would be like everyone else, \"through a series of poor decisions.\" He also called out Cory Booker to come on the show to air out their grievances, deciding to then ban Booker from Burbank airport, adding later that he had absolutely no power to do so. Booker subsequently banned Conan from the state of New Jersey as well as all the sister cities of Newark. In response, O'Brien read a letter on air from Elizabeth, New Jersey mayor Chris Bollwage, declaring that he will temporarily rename Terminal A of Newark Liberty (which lies in Elizabeth) the Conan O'Brien Terminal. Conan continued, saying he had created a \"geographic toilet seat\" around Newark. The mayors of Bayonne, East Orange, Kearny, Jersey City, and Elizabeth have publicly sided with Conan O'Brien. He ended this by saying, \"Your move, Mayor Booker.\" The feud was unofficially ended when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for it to end during a prepared comedy bit, telling Booker to \"chalk it up\" to Conan. The following week Conan announced that Cory Booker would be a guest on the October 16, 2009 show to mend the feud. That night, O'Brien and his wife donated $50,000 to the Newark Now Organization, and NBC Universal matched Conan's donation to total a $100,000 gift. Booker also admitted that he is a big Conan fan and often tapes shows to watch the next day or watches them on the website Hulu.",

O'Brien's successful hosting job at the 2002 54th Primetime Emmy Awards \"sent out the most resounding message yet about his growing strength as a performer\", and a year later, NBC broadcast O'Brien's tenth anniversary special in primetime. By the time Leno's contract again came up for renewal, a discussion would be needed regarding the future of \"The Tonight Show\".

On Thursday, January 7, 2010, NBC executive Jeff Zucker met with Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien to discuss how to get Leno out of prime time, where his ratings were lackluster, and back into late night, where O'Brien's ratings had collapsed before Leno's prime time series began. A proposal was made that would see O'Brien remain as host of \"The Tonight Show\", which would be moved to 12:05\u00a0am with Leno hosting a 30-minute show at 11:35\u00a0pm On January 10, NBC Universal Television Entertainment chairman Jeff Gaspin confirmed that \"The Jay Leno Show\" would indeed end at the start of the Winter Olympics on February 12, 2010, and be moved to 11:35\u00a0pm following the Olympics coverage. Sources familiar with the situation told the \"New York Post\" that O'Brien was unhappy with NBC's plan. On January 12, O'Brien released this statement: \"I sincerely believe that delaying \"The Tonight Show\" into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. \"The Tonight Show\" at 12:05 simply isn\u2019t \"The Tonight Show.\"\" On January 21, 2010, it was announced that Conan had reached a deal with NBC that would see him exit \"The Tonight Show\" the next day. The deal also granted him $45\u00a0million, of which $12\u00a0million was designated for distribution to his staff, who had moved with Conan to Los Angeles from New York when he left \"Late Night\".",

Newark mayor Cory Booker responded in a satirical YouTube video calling for O'Brien to apologize, and that Conan would be banned from ever entering Newark Liberty International Airport until doing so. Conan responded by further making fun of Newark, however, saying the only way he could get to Newark now would be like everyone else, \"through a series of poor decisions.\" He also called out Cory Booker to come on the show to air out their grievances, deciding to then ban Booker from Burbank airport, adding later that he had absolutely no power to do so. Booker subsequently banned Conan from the state of New Jersey as well as all the sister cities of Newark. In response, O'Brien read a letter on air from Elizabeth, New Jersey mayor Chris Bollwage, declaring that he will temporarily rename Terminal A of Newark Liberty (which lies in Elizabeth) the Conan O'Brien Terminal. Conan continued, saying he had created a \"geographic toilet seat\" around Newark. The mayors of Bayonne, East Orange, Kearny, Jersey City, and Elizabeth have publicly sided with Conan O'Brien. He ended this by saying, \"Your move, Mayor Booker.\" The feud was unofficially ended when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for it to end during a prepared comedy bit, telling Booker to \"chalk it up\" to Conan. The following week Conan announced that Cory Booker would be a guest on the October 16, 2009 show to mend the feud. That night, O'Brien and his wife donated $50,000 to the Newark Now Organization, and NBC Universal matched Conan's donation to total a $100,000 gift. Booker also admitted that he is a big Conan fan and often tapes shows to watch the next day or watches them on the website Hulu.",

While hosting \"The Tonight Show\" and analyzing ratings results, O'Brien told his manager Gavin Polone that he feared that Leno might be moved back to the program. Carter's book contains details of O'Brien's and Leno's contracts, and describes O'Brien's emotional state during the 2010 conflict. According to Carter, Leno had an advantage during negotiations because of a stronger contract agreement with NBC, which gave Leno the option to sue NBC if his program was canceled.",

In the beginning, the show was broadcast on \"Tomgreen.com: The Channel\", and on their old website, www.myshowscrazy.com. Newer episodes were premiered on Chin's YouTube account and past episodes had been archived. In 2005, Matt Chin and Ricky Thompson found out that Conan O'Brien needed a replacement for \"Late Night\" on NBC when he goes to \"The Tonight Show\", and have decided to run to take over the job from him in 2009. They've done a lot of things to get that job between 2005 and 2008; such as sending their episodes of \"My Show\" to NBC, making a petition for their audience to sign in order to make that happen, and a few other things. Meanwhile, Carson Daly of \"Last Call with Carson Daly\", Jimmy Fallon, and Tom Green were also campaigning for the job during those 3 years. Of course, Jimmy Fallon ended up being announced to replace Conan O'Brien in 2008, and Matt Chin and Ricky Thompson were devastated. At the same time, Bite TV needed them to host a half-hour late night talk show that will air weekly, and will be produced by Glass Box Productions. When that announcement was made, it made them feel better, and the rest of the story became the nearly 3 year journey of \"The Week Show with Matt Chin.\" Despite very low ratings, the show was loved by everybody who was a fan of \"My Show with Matt Chin\" back in 2001.",

It has been described as the record that foreshadowed Madonna's usage of electronic music in her later work, especially \"Ray of Light\" (1998), which according to Vicente, owes \"its contemplative and electronic techno rave character to 'Bedtime Story'\". O'Brien wrote in \"Madonna: Like an Icon\", that the song \"foreshadowed [the singer's] move towards electronica\" and labelled it an \"embryonic moment that went a lot further on the next few albums\". De Vries recalled that tackling the song \"seemed to set something free in Madonna. She was straining at the leash a little bit, to find some other languages to speak, and 'Bedtime Story' was an embryonic moment that went a lot further on to the next few albums.\" In a review for the \"Bedtime Stories\" album on a whole, Sal Cinquemani of \"Slant Magazine\" wrote that the song was \"the germ that would later inspire Madonna to seek out and conquer electronica with the likes of William Orbit and Mirwais\".",
