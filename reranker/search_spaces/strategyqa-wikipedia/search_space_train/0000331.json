The skin starts to develop blisters which can happen anywhere on the body. To return to any activity one must be cleared by a doctor. Herpes Simplex is the virus that causes cold sores this virus can be spread by oral seceretions and can also cause Herpes Gladiatorial. Once a person becomes infected the virus stays in the body forever and can reactivate itself anytime causing cold sores. Herpes Gladiatorial is a skin infection. it comes from the Herpes Simplex virus which is causes the same lesion one has when they have a cold sore. This form of herpes is on the skin and can be spread through contact with others or sharing beverages with someone who is infected or using anything that they may have contaminated. This virus remains in your system and can reactivate itself at any time causing lesions to appear. Herpes Zoster is the virus which causes shingles and chicken pox. Once one has had the chicken pox they carry the virus forever. Once one has chicken pox the virus is inactive but, if it becomes active again they get the shingles.",

Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms but can be confirmed with specific testing. Prevention includes avoiding kissing or using the personal items of a person who is infected.

Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms but can be confirmed with specific testing. Prevention includes avoiding kissing or using the personal items of a person who is infected. A zinc oxide, anesthetic, or antiviral cream appears to decrease the duration of symptoms by a small amount. Antiviral medications may also decrease the frequency of outbreaks.
