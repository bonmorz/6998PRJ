Sexual dimorphism is very pronounced in the species, with males being typically 5\u201310% larger and 20\u201330% heavier than females. Males also sport a mane running down the back, which is particularly apparent during autumn and winter. The canine teeth are also much more prominent in males, and grow throughout life. The upper canines are relatively short and grow sideways early in life, though gradually curve upwards. The lower canines are much sharper and longer, with the exposed parts measuring in length. In the breeding period, males develop a coating of subcutaneous tissue, which may be thick, extending from the shoulder blades to the rump, thus protecting vital organs during fights. Males sport a roughly egg-sized sack near the opening of the penis, which collects urine and emits a sharp odour. The function of this is not fully understood. Adult size and weight is largely determined by environmental factors; boars living in arid areas with little productivity tend to attain smaller sizes than their counterparts inhabiting areas with abundant food and water.

A ruler or rule is a tool used in, for example, geometry, technical drawing, engineering, and carpentry, to measure lengths or distances or to draw straight lines. Strictly speaking, the \"ruler\" is the instrument used to rule straight lines and the calibrated instrument used for determining length is called a \"measure\", however common usage calls both instruments \"rulers\" and the special name \"straightedge\" is used for an unmarked rule. The use of the word \"measure\", in the sense of a measuring instrument, only survives in the phrase \"tape measure\", an instrument that can be used to measure but cannot be used to draw straight lines. As can be seen in the photographs on this page, a two-metre carpenter's rule can be folded down to a length of only 20 centimetres, to easily fit in a pocket, and a five-metre-long tape measure easily retracts to fit within a small housing.",

However, the giant eland is somewhat larger on average than the common eland and is thus the largest species of antelope in the world. They are typically between in head-and-body length and stand approximately at the shoulder. Giant elands exhibit sexual dimorphism, as males are larger than females. The males weigh and females weigh . The tail is long, having a dark tuft of hair, and averages in length. The life expectancy of giant elands is up to 25 years in the wild, and about 20 years in captivity.",

Like armadillos, and unlike the other extinct branch of megafaunal cingulates, the glyptodonts, the shell was made up of flexible plates which allowed the animal to move more easily. \"Holmesina\" species were herbivores that grazed on coarse vegetation; armadillos are mostly insectivorous or omnivorous. \"Holmesina\" individuals were much larger than any modern armadillo: They could reach a length of , and a weight of , while the modern giant armadillo does not attain more than .",
