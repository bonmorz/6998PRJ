Genghis Khan died in 1227 after defeating the Western Xia. He was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in Mongolia. His descendants extended the Mongol Empire across most of Eurasia by conquering or creating vassal states in all of modern-day China, Korea, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and substantial portions of Eastern Europe and Southwest Asia. Many of these invasions repeated the earlier large-scale slaughters of local populations. As a result, Genghis Khan and his empire have a fearsome reputation in local histories.",

The authors propose that the lineage is carried by likely male-line descendants of Genghis Khan and his close male relatives, and that it has spread through social selection, due to the power that Genghis Khan and his direct descendants held, the desirability of marriage into his line, and a society which allowed one man to have many children by multiple wives and widespread rape in conquered cities.

In 1203, Genghis Khan, in an effort to strengthen his army, ordered a reform that reorganised his army's structure while breaking down the traditional clan- and kindred-based divisions that had previously fragmented the society and military. He arranged his army into \"arbans\" (inter-ethnic groups of ten), and the members of an \"arban\" were commanded to be loyal to one another regardless of ethnic origin. Ten \"arbans\" made a \"zuun\", or a company; ten \"zuuns\" made a \"myangan\", or a battalion; and ten \"myangans\" formed a \"tumen\", or an army of 10,000.

In addition, Nayan was also the foremost leader of the Eastern \"ulus\"es (tribal groupings and districts ruled by Mongol appanage princes) dominated by the descendants of the brothers of Genghis Khan. Whatever the precise extent of Nayan's appanage, he certainly held sufficient lands within and around Manchuria to give him a power-base from which to launch a rebellion against his kinsman Kublai Khan.",

Jochi supposedly was born shortly after B\u00f6rte was liberated and Genghis Khan always accepted Jochi as his first-born son, but to some it remained uncertain whether Tem\u00fcjin Borjigin or Chilger B\u00f6kh was the real father of Jochi. As Genghis Khan\u2019s first-born son, Jochi was favored as rightful heir to the Mongol Empire. It was Chagatai who brought up the dispute of Jochi\u2019s illegitimacy, but Genghis Khan remained determined that Jochi was his legitimate first-born son. It was when Genghis named \u00d6gedei as his rightful successor that Jochi rebelled against his father, Chagatai and \u00d6gedei were sent against Jochi who died in February 1227 before it came to any hostilities. Jochi\u2019s descendants were the oldest branch of the Genghis Khan family, although they were not favored for succession by other rivaling family members.",

Ogedei Khan made Karakorum on the river Orkhon the capital of the Mongol Empire. Karakorum had been a military garrison of Genghis Khan since 1220. The existence of 12 Buddhist temples, 2 Muslim mosques and 1 Christian church in city Karakorum indicates the tolerance of the Mongols to all religions. The construction of the city was supervised by Otchigin, the youngest brother of Genghis Khan. Ogedei Khan established an effective postal yam system with well-organized posts (\u2018\u2019\u00f6rtege\u2019\u2019). The system connected the various regions of the whole Empire. Ogedei Khan settled down the rebellions in the countries conquered during his father and led an army himself to put down a revolt in Korea.",
