A further ambiguity with yes\u2013no questions, in addition to that of polarity, is the ambiguity of whether an \"exclusive\" or \"inclusive\" disjunction is meant by the word \"or\", as it can represent either. Conventionally, in English yes\u2013no questions the \"or\" represents an exclusive disjunction. However, as with the \"Would you like an apple or an orange?\" question mentioned earlier, to which one possible answer, as a yes\u2013no question, is \"yes.\", yes\u2013no questions can also be taken to be \"inclusive\" disjunctions. The informativeness of the \"or\" in the question is low, especially if the second alternative in the question is \"something\" or \"things\". The \"exclusive\" and \"inclusive\" can be determined often in spoken language (the speaker will often lower their pitch at the end of an \"exclusive\" question, as opposed to raising it at the end of an \"inclusive\" question), but it is a frequent source of humour for computer scientists and others familiar with Boolean logic, who will give responses such as \"yes\" to questions such as \"Would you like chicken or roast beef for dinner?\". However, the ambiguity is not confined to humour. The apple-or-orange question may be legitimately asking whether either is wanted, for example, and \"Would you like an apple or something?\" is indeed \"expecting\" either \"yes\" or \"no\" as a proper answer rather than the answer \"Something\" that an exclusive disjunction would be requesting.",

In humans, it is defined as a body core temperature below . Symptoms depend on the temperature. In mild hypothermia there is shivering and mental confusion. In moderate hypothermia shivering stops and confusion increases. In severe hypothermia, there may be paradoxical undressing, in which a person removes his or her clothing, as well as an increased risk of the heart stopping. Hypothermia has two main types of causes. It classically occurs from exposure to extreme cold. It may also occur from any condition that decreases heat production or increases heat loss. Commonly this includes alcohol intoxication but may also include low blood sugar, anorexia, and advanced age. Body temperature is usually maintained near a constant level of through thermoregulation. Efforts to increase body temperature involve shivering, increased voluntary activity, and putting on warmer clothing. Hypothermia may be diagnosed based on either a person's symptoms in the presence of risk factors or by measuring a person's core temperature. The treatment of mild hypothermia involves warm drinks, warm clothing, and physical activity. In those with moderate hypothermia, heating blankets and warmed intravenous fluids are recommended. People with moderate or severe hypothermia should be moved gently. In severe hypothermia, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass may be useful. In those without a pulse, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is indicated along with the above measures. Rewarming is typically continued until a person's temperature is greater than . If there is no improvement at this point or the blood potassium level is greater than 12\u00a0mmol/liter at any time, resuscitation may be discontinued. Hypothermia is the cause of at least 1,500 deaths a year in the United States. It is more common in older people and males. One of the lowest documented body temperatures from which someone with accidental hypothermia has survived is in a near-drowning of a 7-year-old girl in Sweden. Survival after more than six hours of CPR has been described. For those for whom ECMO or bypass is used, survival is around 50%. Deaths due to hypothermia have played an important role in many wars. The term is from Greek \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf, \"ypo\", meaning \"under\", and \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1, \"therm\u00eda\", meaning \"heat\".

Thermoregulation is the ability of an organism to keep its body temperature within certain boundaries, even when the surrounding temperature is very different. A thermoconforming organism, by contrast, simply adopts the surrounding temperature as its own body temperature, thus avoiding the need for internal thermoregulation. The internal thermoregulation process is one aspect of homeostasis: a state of dynamic stability in an organism's internal conditions, maintained far from thermal equilibrium with its environment (the study of such processes in zoology has been called physiological ecology). If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal, a condition known as hyperthermia occurs. For humans, this occurs when the body is exposed to constant temperatures of approximately , and with prolonged exposure (longer than a few hours) at this temperature and up to around death is almost inevitable. Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the wet bulb temperature is sustained above for six hours. The opposite condition, when body temperature decreases below normal levels, is known as hypothermia. It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction, causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it. Normal body temperature is around , and hypothermia sets in when the core body temperature gets lower than . Usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures, hypothermia is usually treated by methods that attempt to raise the body temperature back to a normal range.",

The outlook expected the present La Ni\u00f1a to persist and intensify into the winter, resulting in drier than normal conditions in the drought-stricken states of New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and parts of adjacent states. The CPC noted the significance of the less-predictable Arctic Oscillation, with CPC deputy director Mike Halpert saying, \"The erratic Arctic Oscillation can generate strong shifts in the climate patterns that could overwhelm or amplify La Ni\u00f1a's typical impacts.\" The outlook was broken up into ten regions. The outlook anticipated above-normal wildfire conditions across the entire southern part of the United States, cooler and wetter-than-average conditions in the Pacific Northwest and western Montana, likewise for northern California, and drier-than-average conditions for southern California. Colder and wetter-than-average conditions were favored in the Northern Plains, but the converse was expected to occur in the Southern Plains and Gulf Coast states, worsening pre-existing drought conditions. In Florida and the southern Atlantic states, equal chances existed for below, near, and above-average temperatures, with below-average precipitation favored for the region and above-normal wildfire conditions. Equal chances for below, near, and above-average temperatures existed in the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, with wetter-than-average conditions favored, resulting in an enhanced potential for storms and flooding. Equal chances for below, near, and above-average precipitation and temperatures existed in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states. The outlook noted that winter weather in this region often driven by the Arctic Oscillation rather than La Ni\u00f1a, and as such, if enough cold air and moisture were to coalesce, areas north of the Ohio Valley and into the Northeastern U.S. could expect above-average snowfall. Colder and wetter-than-average conditions were favored in the Great Lakes region, and above-average temperatures with above-average precipitation were favored in the western islands of Hawaii, resulting in the potential for elimination of drought, particularly in Kauai and Oahu. The outlook ended by noting chances favoring below-average temperatures in the southern half of Alaska and the panhandle with below-average levels of precipitation favored in the eastern interior region of the state.",

The southern end of the island has a typical oceanic climate with several maritime features. One of those is the delayed summer (May and June are very cool compared to nearby mainland areas), called seasonal lag. There is a very low diurnal temperature variation, which often results in very mild nights year-round compared with nearby cities and towns. Winters are more prone to cold than summers are to heat, owing to the possibility of coastal ice eliminating maritime moderation in winter months when inland temperatures are colder. During months in which ice is not a risk, all-time lows are much milder than during adjacent months. These cold snaps are rare. The area has a distinct microclimate, with relatively low precipitation for the reference period of 1961-1990. In spite of it being an extreme maritime climate by Swedish standards, it still is quite continental compared to similar latitudes in Scotland.",

In mild climates an air source heat pump can be used to air condition the building during hot weather, and to warm the building using heat extracted from outdoor air in cold weather. Air-source heat pumps are generally uneconomic for outdoor temperatures much below freezing. In colder climates, geothermal heat pumps can be used to extract heat from the ground. For economy, these systems are designed for average low winter temperatures and use supplemental heating for extreme low temperature conditions. The advantage of the heat pump is that it reduces the purchased energy required for building heating; often geothermal source systems also supply domestic hot water. Even in places where fossil fuels provide most electricity, a geothermal system may offset greenhouse gas production since most of the heat is supplied from the surrounding environment, with only 15\u201330% as electrical consumption.",

            "document": "Thrifty gene hypothesis . An alternative idea to explain the greater prevalence of diabetes in more northerly populations was suggested by Moalem et al. who noted that recent animal research has uncovered the importance of the generation of elevated levels of glucose, glycerol and other sugar derivatives as a physiological means for cold adaptation. High concentrations of these substances depress the freezing point of body fluids and prevent the formation of ice crystals in cells through supercooling, thus acting as a cryoprotectant or antifreeze for vital organs as well as in their muscle tissue. They consequently suggested that factors predisposing to elevated levels of glucose, glycerol and other sugar derivatives may have been selected for, in part, as adaptive measures in exceedingly cold climates. The authors suggest that this cryoprotective adaptation would have protected ancestral northern Europeans from the effects of suddenly increasingly colder climates, such as those believed to have arisen around 14,000 years ago and culminating in the Younger Dryas. A major issue with this whole idea, however, is that glucose, gycerol and sugar derivatives only become useful as cryoprotectants as the body temperature falls to the point where tissues are at risk of freezing \u2013 which is below 0 oC. Since no human ever survived a period of hypothermia with a body temperature less than 10 oC, because of heart failure, there is no possibility that this could ever have provided any selective advantage in our past history \u2013 no matter how cold the external temperature was.",

In summer, dense wildfire smoke accumulates in the Tanana Valley, affecting the weather and causing health concerns. When temperature inversions arise in winter, heavy ice fog often results. Ice fog occurs when air is too cold to absorb additional moisture, such as that released by automobile engines or human breath. Instead of dissipating, the water freezes into microscopic crystals that are suspended in the air, forming fog. Another one of Fairbanks' unusual occurrences is the prevalence of the aurora borealis, commonly called the northern lights, which are visible on average more than 200\u00a0days per year in the vicinity of Fairbanks. Fairbanks also has extremely low seasonal lag; the year's warmest month is July, which averages only warmer than June. Average daily temperatures begin to fall by late July and more markedly in August, which on average is cooler than June. The pattern of fall being colder than spring and a relatively early (late June/early July) peak in the year's average highest temperatures is due to the city's strategic location in a valley, far from any large body of water. This specific combination of features is virtually nonexistent elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere.",
