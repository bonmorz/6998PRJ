Other \"retiarius\" tricks were to whip the net at his opponent's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him. The helmet of the \"secutor\" was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net. In most cases, the \"secutor\" knew to expect the net-man's tactics and tried to intercept and hold on to the weapon, possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net. In such danger, the \"retiarius\" could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger. The \"secutor\" stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it. Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the \"retiarius\" used his net. Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net, yet the class is named for the device, and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a \"retiarius\" in his satires. The discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance, and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict. The lack of nets in \"retiarius\" images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility is that some \"retiarii\" simply did not use nets. In most bouts, the \"retiarius\" probably had to resort to fighting with just his trident and dagger, placing him at a disadvantage. The trident was his primary weapon in such situations, and its length allowed the \"retiarius\" to keep his opponent at bay. He held the weapon two-handed, left nearer the prongs, so that he could parry his enemy's strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends. Wielded two-handed, the weapon could land powerful blows. Images show \"retiarii\" stabbing downward at the \"secutor\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s unshielded legs or stabbing down at the helmet in an attempt to poke through an eyehole. The trident itself was too weak to pierce the metal, although a skull found at Ephesus, Turkey, dating to CE\u00a0200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to the head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent. The \"secutor\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s helmet was rounded and free of protrusions to avoid snaring the net or being caught in the trident's prongs, but attacks on it forced the \"secutor\" to duck or hide behind his shield. This reduced his field of vision and gave the \"retiarius\" an advantage with his speed. Should the \"secutor\" strike with his sword, the \"retiarius\" parried with the trident prongs and attempted to disarm him. Likewise, the more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block the trident with his shield and force the net-man to lose it. Another type of gladiator, scissor could also be pitted against a \"retiarius\". Images from the Eastern Roman Empire show \"scissores\" wearing a tubular arm-guard in lieu of a shield. The guard fits over the left hand and ends in a hooked, knife-like blade that was probably intended to parry the net and trident or to snag and pull away the net. \"Scissores\" who succeeded in this probably dropped the hook weapon and fought with just a sword.",

            "document": "Gatka . All pole weapons begin with the staff, known as a \"dang\" or \"lathi\". The dang's ideal length is either equal to the height or the armspan of its wielder. Gatka typically uses a bamboo staff, which may be steel-tipped and encased in leather. This type of dang is held with both hands on one end and used for swinging techniques. The light weight of the bamboo allows for great speed and a variety of twirling maneuvres. This style of fighting was often used by peasants and commoners for whom the staff was a domestic tool and a convenient implement of self-defense. For warriors who used the dang as a training tool for edged weapons, a different method was employed. In this style, the dang is held diagonally with the hands far apart. The butt end of the weapon is held with one hand, while the other hand is further down the middle or just above the other end. This grip lends itself to thrusting attacks aimed at the vital points (\"marma\"), done by pushing the weapon forward with the back hand through the front hand, though it also incorporates \"barta\", techniques in which both ends are used to attack. This thrust-based method can be easily adapted to edged weapons such as spears, tridents and battle-axes. In the case of the axe, thrusts hit with the weapon's head, which can also be used defensively to stop an opponent's attack or to break their fingers. The \"barta\" method can also be adapted to edged polearms, most of which have a weighted or spiked back end. When wielding a heavy polearm in close-quarters, the fighter may hold a katara on one hand.",

It is speculated that they attempted to trap their opponents' weapons between the twin blades in order to disarm them. German historian and experimental archeologist Marcus Junkelmann has propagated an idea, based on an unlabeled, unclear image that he decided might be a scissor, that this type of gladiator fought using a weapon consisting of a hardened steel tube that encased the gladiator's entire forearm, with the hand end capped off and a semicircular blade attached to it.",

For a medium weapon (a short spear, a bayoneted gun or a two-handed sword), requiring two hands, the left hand grabs near the buttstock and the right a comfortable distance ahead of it, about one foot up to give an estimation. The left hand is either squarely in front of the lower belly, or it is closer to the left hip, depending on how long the weapon is compared to the user\u2019s height. The point is comfortably stretched out towards the opponent\u2019s neck or upper chest. The stance is more square than for the short weapon, although the right foot is still forward somewhat. To thrust, the right and left hands both push forward together, but the right hand then releases its grip to allow the left to keep pushing the weapon out to its fullest extent. At the same time, the left foot is brought from behind to step far forward in front of the right foot, and finally the right foot is shifted forward and to the left to align it with the point of the weapon and the left foot. The left hand must then pull the weapon back so that the right hand can grab it and return to the on guard position described above. The feet go through a reverse pattern of what they just did to return the body to its initial position. This is a more complex movement than with the short weapon, and so takes much drill to become comfortable with.",

But, one of the key advantages of the weapon was that unlike bows, which required years of training largely available only to the samurai class, guns could be used by relatively untrained footmen. Samurai stuck to their swords and their bows, engaging in cavalry or infantry tactics, while the \"ashigaru\" wielded the guns. Some militant Buddhist factions began to produce firearms in foundries normally employed to make bronze temple bells. In this manner, the Ikk\u014d-ikki, a group of monks and lay religious zealots, turned their Ishiyama Honganji cathedral-fortress into some of the most well-defended fortresses in the country. The \"ikki\" and a handful of other militant religious factions thus became powers unto themselves, and fought fierce battles against some of the chief generals and samurai clans of the archipelago.",

Four years later, Nightmare had begun on his Soul Edge ritual again in his old castle, wanting to resurrect Soul Edge, but his ritual was interrupted by an exiled French nobleman, Raphael Sorel. Although Raphael was utterly defeated, he was able to penetrate Soul Edge, which gave Siegfried and Soul Calibur the time to break free of its control fully. Soul Edge was then pierced by Siegfried using Soul Calibur, trapping them in the \"Soul Embrace\". While things seemed to go normal afterwards, Zasalamel had returned to try and free both swords, intending to use their power to break his cycle of reincarnation induced by Soul Calibur. He managed to do so, and Inferno took a physical form to become the \"second Nightmare\". Siegfried clashed with this new Nightmare, but was wounded in the process and had to be healed by Soul Calibur, tying him with it permanently, while Soul Edge was cast to the void to heal itself. The clash of Soul Edge and Soul Calibur had awakened Algol from his slumber, who rose the Tower of Remembrance to wait for warriors to challenge him. Meanwhile, Nightmare, with his servant Tira, wanting to gather the Soul Edge fragments to complete Soul Edge, forced several warriors, including Astaroth, Sophitia, and Voldo into servitude, while Siegfried, having recovered, set out to confront Nightmare.
