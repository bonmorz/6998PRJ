While in no way excusing his past actions, it's worth noting MT was convicted over twenty years ago, and served his time. In recent years he has found sobriety, and started a foundation to meet the comprehensive needs of children from broken homes. The episode itself deals with many issues, including the ongoing effects of childhood abuse, the possibility of rehabilitation, and the potential for disastrous results when individuals and/or the justice system pre-judge or fail to contextualize. Because of SVU's subject matter, all of us have a profound sense of our responsibility. Our intent, as always, is to provoke discussion and awareness. We ask you to keep an open mind. Thanks.\" On January 21, 2013 after receiving further complaints, he followed up with \"...please know that I\u2019ve heard you. When tweets become harassment, I will have to block. Thnx.\" Mike Tyson, who had already made his excitement known in a tweet, shared his thoughts about the role in a subsequent interview. This took place on January 29, 2013, after the petition against his casting had gained momentum. Viewing his character as a separate person and not a fictionalized version of himself, Tyson said, \"I have no emotional connection to the role. As a human being I can relate to it, but it has nothing to do with me.\" He also mentioned being a fan of \"SVU\", calling it \"the most exciting show on TV\" and saying \"My wife [Lakiha Spicer, whom he wed in 2009] and I looked on this show a lot, especially when I was going through my relapse and drug periods.\" In response to the criticism, Tyson maintained, as he has since 1992, that he was innocent of raping Desiree Washington. With the filming of his episode complete, he also commented that Mariska Hargitay was \"very quiet\" on the set of \"SVU\". Adding to the controversy surrounding the casting choice was that the air date originally planned, February 13, 2013, coincided with One Billion Rising, a global movement to end violence against women and girls. On January 30, NBC switched \"Monster's Legacy\" with \"Secrets Exhumed\" so that Tyson's episode would air on February 6 instead. Four days before the episode, \"Law & Order\" creator Dick Wolf announced that he supported NBC's decision to produce the episode and hire Mike Tyson to guest star. This angered fans, as he did not acknowledge any of the petitions or ethical concerns. \"Monster's Legacy\" aired on February 6, 2013, becoming Mike Tyson's first acting appearance not playing himself.",

The issue was brought to the Home Office, a department of the U.K. government that is responsible for immigration and security, and on 13 January 2000 the head of the department, Home Secretary Jack Straw, announced his decision to allow Tyson into the country, stating that he \"did not want to hurt the businesses in Manchester that were expecting a windfall from the fight or disappoint the fans who had bought tickets.\" Several of Britain's top politicians criticized Straw's decision, including Trevor Phillips who accused Straw of \"caving in\" and \"ignoring the law.\" Tyson officially arrived in England on 16 January 2000, where he was met with protests from the feminist women's group, Justice For Women, who hoped to have the decision to allow Tyson in England overturned.

            "document": "Evander Holyfield vs. Larry Holmes . Holyfield's previous fight was a tough victory over journeyman fighter Bert Cooper, who was a last-minute replacement for Francesco Damiani, who himself was a replacement for Mike Tyson, after Damiani determined that he could not compete due to a foot injury. Cooper nearly managed to dethrone Holyfield of his title in the third round when he was able to deliver the first knockdown of Holyfield's professional career. Holyfield, however, was able to rebound from the knockdown to earn the victory via 7th round technical knockout. After his defeat of Cooper, Holyfield had hoped to next fight Tyson. The two men were originally scheduled to fight each other on November 8, 1991, before Tyson pulled out of the fight with a rib injury. Then on February 10, 1992, Tyson was convicted of rape and sentenced to six years in prison, leading to the cancellation of the Holyfield\u2013Tyson fight. On March 5, 1992, it was announced that Holyfield's next opponent would be 42-year-old former Heavyweight champion Larry Holmes. Holmes had twice retired, first after losing a rematch to Michael Spinks in 1986 for the IBF Heavyweight Championship, and then again after a loss to Mike Tyson in 1988 for the Undisputed Heavyweight Championship. In 1991, Holmes launched a successful comeback, winning five consecutive fights before facing undefeated Olympic Gold Medalist Ray Mercer in a match to determine the number one contender. Though Holmes came into the fight as an underdog, he was able to outpoint Mercer en route to a victory by unanimous decision.",

In an interview for \"Rolling Stone\" he explained: \"I didn't know what the hell I was going there for. I'm just there having a good time and hanging out with Madonna. She has her producer there and I go into the studio and I didn't know if she wanted me to talk or rap. I just go in there and start talking. I'm talking about my life and things that I have endured. I'm saying some really crazy stuff. It was really intense.\"",

He had 15 bouts in his first year as a professional. Fighting frequently, Tyson won 26 of his first 28 fights by KO or TKO; 16 of those came in the first round. The quality of his opponents gradually increased to journeyman fighters and borderline contenders, like James Tillis, David Jaco, Jesse Ferguson, Mitch Green and Marvis Frazier. His win streak attracted media attention and Tyson was billed as the next great heavyweight champion. D'Amato died in November 1985, relatively early into Tyson's professional career, and some speculate that his death was the catalyst to many of the troubles Tyson was to experience as his life and career progressed.",
