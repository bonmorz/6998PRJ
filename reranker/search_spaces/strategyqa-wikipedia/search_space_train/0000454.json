For a casual observer the Church is just a social reality \u2013 an association of human beings who profess a common faith, who participate in a common worship and who endeavour to live by a common ethical code. But for believing Christians the Church is also a faith reality. There is a grace-filled depth to the Church. In the Apostles\u2019 Creed we profess: \"We believe in the holy Catholic Church.\" It is the faith understanding of the Church that will be articulated here.  The Church is not a purely human enterprise. God is at work in the origin and development of the Church. That is what we Christians believe. St. Paul speaks of \"the Church of God that is at Corinth\" (1 Cor. 1:2). This probably refers to the local Christian community there. In The Bible \"the Church of the living God\" most likely denotes the entire world-wide assembly of the followers of Jesus Christ. The Second Vatican Council (1962\u201365) spoke of the mystery of the Church. The Church is a mystery because it is part of God\u2019s plan of salvation. In the New Testament, particularly in the Letters of Paul, mystery refers to the divine design for the salvation of humankind. It was God\u2019s plan to offer to everyone the possibility of salvation and to assemble in the Church all those who would believe in his Son. When we say that the Church is a mystery we not only mean that the Church is part of God\u2019s plan of salvation for humankind but also that God is at all times present and active in the Church. As Pope Paul VI stated: \"The Church is a mystery. It is a reality imbued with the hidden presence of God.\". The expression, the Church of God, also signifies a Church that is rooted in the experience of God. Just as Israel originated in the experience of the liberating God in Exodus, so too the Christian Church sprang up from the experience of the saving God in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. One becomes a member of the Church by sharing this experience. Against this background we can see how significant it is that in Ecclesia in Asia Pope John Paul II exhorts the Church to be ever more deeply \"rooted in the experience of God which flows from a living faith.\" Only then can the Church fulfil its vocation to be a meeting place of God and human beings. As the Pope declares: \"The Church cannot therefore be understood merely as a social organization or agency of human welfare. Despite having sinful men and women in her midst, the Church must be seen as the privileged place of encounter between God and human beings, in which God chooses to reveal the mystery of his inner life and carry out his plan of salvation for the world.\"",

This postulate was what made modernism unique in the history of heresies in the Church. Previously, a heretic (someone who believed and taught something different from what the rest of the church believed) would either claim that he was right and the rest of the Church was wrong because he had received a new revelation from God, or that he had understood the true teaching of God which had previously been understood but was later lost. Both of these scenarios almost inevitably led to an organisational separation from the Church (schism) or the offender\u2019s being ejected from it (excommunication). Using the new idea that doctrines evolve, it was possible for the modernist to believe that both the old teachings of the Church and his new, seemingly contradictory teachings were correct \u2014 each group had its time and place.

A decree of canonization invites the whole Church to venerate the person as a saint, while beatification merely permits it. Catholic theologians agree that both Pope Pius IX's 1854 definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of Mary and Pope Pius XII's 1950 definition of the dogma of the Assumption of Mary are instances of papal infallibility, a fact confirmed by the Church's magisterium.

While rejecting all other mediators between God and man, classical Lutheranism continues to honor the memory of the Virgin Mary and other exemplary saints. This principle rejects sacerdotalism, the belief that there are no sacraments in the church without the services of priests ordained by apostolic succession. The Catholic Church teaches that lay people, and even unbaptized people, can validly baptize, and may do so in an emergency, and that the ministers of the sacrament of matrimony are the people getting married, not the priest, who is only a witness to the marriage, although a witness is legally required in the modern Western Catholic church. Other sacraments, according to Catholic doctrine, essentially require a bishop or at least a priest in order to be valid. Martin Luther taught the \"general priesthood of the baptized\", which was modified in later Lutheranism and classical Protestant theology into \"the priesthood of all believers\" denying the exclusive use of the title \"priest\" (Latin \"sacerdos\") to the clergy. This principle does not deny the office of the holy ministry to which is committed the public proclamation of the Gospel and the administration of the sacraments. In this way, Luther in his \"Small Catechism\" could speak of the role of \"a confessor\" to confer sacramental absolution on a penitent. The section in this catechism known as \"The Office of the Keys\" (not written by Luther but added with his approval) identifies the \"called ministers of Christ\" as being the ones who exercise the binding and loosing of absolution and excommunication through Law and Gospel ministry. This is laid out in the Lutheran formula of holy absolution: the \"called and ordained servant of the Word\" forgives penitents' sins (speaks Christ's words of forgiveness: \"I forgive you all your sins\") without any addition of penances or satisfactions and not as an interceding or mediating \"priest\", but \"by virtue of [his] office as a called and ordained servant of the Word\" and \"in the stead and by the command of [his] Lord Jesus Christ\". In this tradition absolution reconciles the penitent with God directly through faith in Christ's forgiveness rather than with the priest and the church as mediating entities between the penitent and God.",

Pope John Paul II emphasizes heavily on protecting a person's dignity in using media, which will require a positive development, that has clear structure, since media not only provide for mere entertainment, but has close connections to all areas of human life, \"i.e. Politics, economy, culture\". There are three \u201cfundamental options\u201d) the Church and her members face today: formation, participation, and dialogue. First, the formation of media has to be closely observed and filtered, such as formation of a new vocabulary used widely in media, then spreading to everyday language. Pope John Paul II notes that without \u201cproper formation,\u201d) the media would no longer be serving humanity, but shaping our beliefs and minds. In this, chiefly the younger generation are the most concerned, who would need critical and responsible education on the use of media(11). Second, a true participation by all members are encouraged, in which the Pope calls for a \u201cculture of co-responsibility,\u201d towards handling of media. Lastly, mass media's role of promoting dialogue and as tool of reciprocal knowledge is highlighted. However, this feature is like a double-edged sword, in that if used for good purpose, it can become the most powerful tool in spreading peace and understandings amongst humanity, or, \u201ca destructive weapon\u201d) if it were to be used in a negative manner. Pope John Paul II refers to his predecessors, who have discussed about such features of media we face today, such as Pius XII. Pius XII recognized the value of public opinion within and towards the Church, which is a strong feature of media communications. Also, according to the Code of Canon Law, everyone has a right to express their opinion. Therefore, John Paul II is telling the readers that his goal of writing such document on media today, isn't aiming for complete control and coercion over the people's mind and opinions. Although the Church must not leave room for arbitrary interpretations of the faith, by no means it is promoting the absolute power of the Church\u2014rather, he notes that the dialogue between the faithful is valued within the Church. John Paul II expands on the promotion of dialogues, yet he notes that although the Church is open to all, there will be times when an \u201cadequate confidentiality\u201d is required for the good of all.",

Today, theism is losing prevalence in Europe in favour of atheism and agnosticism, and religion is losing prevalence in favour of secularism. European countries have experienced a decline in church attendance as well as a decline in the number of people professing a religious belief. The 2005 Eurobarometer Poll found that, on average, 52% of the citizens of EU Member States state that they believe there is a God, 27% believe there is some sort of spirit or life force and 18% don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force. 3% declined to answer.",

As more naturalistic and scientific studies of history appeared, a way of thinking called historicism arose which suggested that ideas are conditioned by the age in which they are expressed; thus modernists generally believed that most dogma or teachings of the Church were novelties which arose because of specific circumstances obtaining at given points in its history. At the same time rationalism and literary criticism reduced the possible role of the miraculous, so that the philosophical systems in vogue at the time taught among other things that the existence of God could never be known (see Agnosticism). Theology, formerly \u201cqueen of the sciences\u201d, was dethroned, and it was argued that religion must primarily be caused by, and thus be centered on, the feelings of believers. This argument bolsters the impact of secularism by weakening any position supporting the favouring of one religion over another in a given state, on the principle that if no scientific and reasonable assumption of its truth can be made, society should not be so organised as to privilege any particular religion.",

It may also form other brands of skepticism, such as Pyrrhonism, which do not take a positive stance in regard to the existence of god(s), but remain negative. Alternatively, doubt over the existence of god(s) may lead to acceptance of a particular religion: compare Pascal's Wager. Doubt of a specific theology, scriptural or deistic, may bring into question the truth of that theology's set of beliefs. On the other hand, doubt as to some doctrines but acceptance of others may lead to the growth of heresy and/or the splitting off of sects or groups of thought.

The reformers believed that human beings \u2013 even saints canonized by the Roman Catholic Church, the popes, and the ecclesiastical hierarchy \u2013 are not worthy of the glory that was accorded them; that is, one should not exalt such humans for their good works, but rather praise and give glory to God who is the author and sanctifier of these people and their good works. It is not clear the extent to which such inappropriate veneration is actually approved by the Roman Catholic Church and so the extent to which this Sola is one of justified opposition is unclear. The Roman Catholic's official position, for example as described in the documents of the Second Vatican Council, make it clear that God alone is deserving of glory.",
