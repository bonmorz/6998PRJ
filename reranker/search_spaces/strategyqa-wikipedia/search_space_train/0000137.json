The \"Millionaire\" franchise's catchphrase is \"Is that your final answer?\" (more commonly said by some versions' hosts as \"Final answer?\" or simply \"Final?\"), a question derived from a rule requirement that the players must clearly indicate their choices before being made official (since the nature of the game allows the player to think aloud about the options before committing to an answer). As a side effect, once a final answer has been given, it cannot be changed. Many parodies of the game show capitalised on this phrase. However, not every version has taken over such a catchphrase so that the answer is stated rather informally in that case.",

            "document": "Star Trek: Enterprise (season 4) . The fourth season sought to be different from the previous series of \"Enterprise\" in the way that story arcs worked. In the earlier series there was the ongoing Temporal Cold War plot, with the Xindi attack at the end of the second season resulting in a season long story arc during season three. Instead season four was split up into several smaller arcs which had been planned before the start of the season. The first of these arcs was a resolution to the long running Temporal Cold War, with Braga stating that the intention was \"to resolve [it]... once and for all\". This would also mark the final appearance of the Suliban in \"Enterprise\" as they were tied into that storyline. However, the episodes wrapping up the cold war did not reveal the identity of \"future guy\", the person from the future who was advising the Suliban. Braga explained in a pre-season interview that \"Well, we've been debating that for quite some time, and I'll leave that question open. We haven't decided yet. We have some ideas about him \u2014 or her \u2014 or it. But we haven't settled on any one identity yet. It's still a question mark.\" The identity of \"future guy\" was later revealed by Braga on Twitter as Archer from the future. Brent Spiner returned to the \"Star Trek\" franchise, having previously played the character of Data in \"\". In \"Enterprise\" he played the role of Dr. Arik Soong, an ancestor of Data's creator. Coto compared the character to Hannibal Lecter and talked about the fear that he inspired in the human authorities during the time of \"Enterprise\" due to Soong's actions involving illegal genetics. The storyline involved several references to \"The Original Series\", such as the genetic supermen in the vein of Khan Noonien Singh as first seen in the episode \"Space Seed\" and later in the 1982 film, \"\". The first episode of this \"Enterprise\" story arc also saw the re-appearance of the Orion slave girls as seen in the first pilot of \"Star Trek\", \"\". Coto credited this to his idea for the fourth season saying, \"What I really wanted to do this season is make the episodes that I as a Star Trek fan would have to see. You know, as a fan of the original series, if I heard that they were doing the Orion slavers and the Eugenics Wars, I would have to be in front of that TV.\"",

Goldsmith was rumoured to be creating the theme tune for \"Enterprise\", as although he did not typically work on television, because of his affiliation with the \"Star Trek\" franchise, when he talked of creating a new television theme it was presumed that it would be for this series. The franchise was known for typically using orchestral themes, but Berman said that the theme tune would be more \"contemporary\" than heard in previous series and a \"little hipper\". The theme was revealed to be a cover of the Rod Stewart single \"Faith of the Heart\", by British tenor Russell Watson. Stewart's song had originally appeared on the soundtrack to the 1998 film \"Patch Adams\". For the use in \"Enterprise\", it was retitled to \"Where My Heart Will Take Me\", but prompted a negative reaction from existing \"Star Trek\" fans. These included an online petition to have the song removed, and there was a protest held outside of Paramount Studios. Executive producers Braga and Berman both defended the choice, with Berman saying that the fan response was split over the song while Braga said that some people found the song \"uplifting\". It was remixed for the third season, most notably with a new guitar track and fewer backing vocals. The song was not used on episodes 18 and 19 of series four (In a Mirror, Darkly Parts 1 and 2), nor were the usual introductory images. The images were much more warlike than the examples in the regular opening titles.",

Other beam katanas, while lacking the beam loop, have unique blade designs. Travis can purchase three additional beam katanas in the course of \"No More Heroes\" from the character Dr. Naomi: the Tsubaki Mk-I, an improved version of the Blood Berry, the Mk-II, a powerful five-beam weapon, and the Mk-III, created from Thunder Ryu's katana and regarded by Naomi as the ultimate version. In \"No More Heroes 2\", Travis can wield four types of beam katanas, including dual katanas called the \"Rose Nasty\" and a \"giant beam katana\" called the Peony. The Mk.
