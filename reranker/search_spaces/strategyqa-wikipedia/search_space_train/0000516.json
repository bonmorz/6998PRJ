What are Samus's aspirations, history, and fears?\" and further stated that \"Nintendo appreciated the questions, but had never thought about them before, and ultimately didn't have a lot of answers\" and at the end, Nintendo \"felt uncomfortable with our team [Hollywood] being the ones to propose those answers\" which basically caused the \"Metroid\" movie project to be ultimately canceled sometime in 2007. Foxhoven however foresees \"Metroid\" becoming a movie, stating at the end of the IGN interview that \"for Nintendo, they walked away appreciating the process and how much further they needed to explore the franchise so that it has a chance for a feature film at some point\" and he revealed that \"there are quite a few Hollywood executives in town who grew up playing \"Metroid\", and who would be willing to take the time needed to bring Nintendo along in the process.\"",

When we sense the boy, tormented and insecure, trapped inside the adult man, \"Five Easy Pieces\" becomes a masterpiece of heartbreaking intensity... The movie is joyously alive to the road life of its hero. We follow him through bars and bowling alleys, motels and mobile homes, and we find him rebelling against lower-middle-class values even as he embraces them. In one magical scene, he leaps from his car in a traffic jam and starts playing the piano on the truck in front of him; the scene sounds forced, described this way, but Rafelson and Nicholson never force anything, and never have to.

Generally, a greyhound's career will end between the ages of four and six \u2013 after the dog can no longer race, or possibly when it is no longer competitive.

An UK industry produced report for DEFRA in 2018 showed that actually only 1 in 7 racing greyhounds were not found a home when they retired. In the United States, prior to the formation of adoption groups, over 20,000 retired greyhounds a year were killed; recent estimates still number in the thousands, with the industry claiming that about 90% of National Greyhound Association-registered animals are either adopted or returned for breeding purposes (according to the industry numbers upwards of 2000 dogs are still euthanized annually in the US while anti-racing groups estimate the figure at closer to 12,000.) Other greyhounds are sold to research labs, such as Liverpool university animal training school, who have received the remains of dogs killed at Manchester's Belle Vue stadium. A trainer in Lincolnshire was also exposed offering 'slow' dogs to the Liverpool school. Additionally dogs are sent to foreign racetracks such as Spain and sometimes in developing countries.

            "document": "Constructivist teaching methods . Learning environments for adults based on constructivist philosophy include opportunities for students to make meaningful connections between new material and previous experience, through discovery. One of the simplest ways to do this is asking open-ended questions. Open-ended questions such as \"Tell me about a time when... .\" or \"How might this information be useful to you?\" cause learners to think about how new information may relate to their own experience. Student responses to such questions are opportunities for experiencing the perspectives of others. For these questions to be effective it is critical that instructors focus on teaching content that is useful for participants. The importance of using these types of strategies with adults contributes to what Bain(2004 p.\u00a04) noted as critical learning environments where instructors \"embed\" the skills they are teaching in \"authentic tasks that will arouse curiosity, challenge students to rethink assumptions and examine their mental modes of reality\". Mezirow J. (1997) who asserts that learners need to practice in recognizing frames of reference and using their imaginations to redefine problems from different perspectives. (pg. 10) I made the connection by also adding the point that \"to promote discovery learning, the educator often reframes learner questions in terms of the learner's current level of understanding. Learning contracts, group projects, role play, case studies, and simulations are classroom methods associated with transformative education.\" Such approaches emphasize that learning is not an \"all or nothing\" process but that students learn the new information that is presented to them by building upon knowledge that they already possess. It is therefore important that teachers constantly assess the knowledge their students have gained to make sure that the students' perceptions of the new knowledge are what the teacher had intended. Teachers will find that since the students build upon already existing knowledge, when they are called upon to retrieve the new information, they may make errors. It is known as reconstruction error when we fill in the gaps of our understanding with logical, though incorrect, thoughts. Teachers need to catch and try to correct these errors, though it is inevitable that some reconstruction error will continue to occur because of our innate retrieval limitations.",
