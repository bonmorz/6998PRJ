Maleva tells him that she knows of someone who can help cure him.

By chance, during his transformations into a werewolf, he falls into the castle's frozen catacombs and revives Frankenstein's monster. Finding that the Monster is unable to locate the notes of the long-dead doctor, Talbot seeks out Baroness Elsa Frankenstein, hoping she knows their hiding place. A performance of the life-affirming folk song \"Faro-la Faro-Li\" enrages Talbot into a fit before the Frankenstein Monster crashes the village festival. With the Monster revealed, Elsa gives the notes to Talbot and Dr. Mannering, who has tracked Talbot across Europe, so that they may be used in an effort to drain all life from both Talbot and the Monster. Ultimately, however, Dr. Mannering's desire to see the Monster at full strength overwhelms his logic, and to Elsa's horror he decides to fully revive it. As an unfortunate coincidence, the experiment takes place on the night of a full moon, and Talbot is transformed just as the Monster regains his strength.

Grunzke also argues that \"Dr. Black, Mr. Hyde\" provides commentary on evolutionary arguments for slavery by depicting Pride-as-Hyde with \"ape-like features, body hair and the like.\" Being more akin to a Frankenstein monster than a Mr. Hyde, Pride is capitalizing on \"the ways that the Frankenstein narrative was embraced by the African American community to turn the tables on this misguided Darwinist argument\" - that misguided argument being that African Americans were inferior and thus should be enslaved. By appearing as a white man to the other characters, it appears that Crain is attempting to depict the white man in a black world as being bestial By being more Frankenstein-esque, Pride gains sympathy from the audience as he struggles with being in an unknown world - despite being white when he is Mr. Hyde. Grunzke's argument stems from Elizabeth Young's argument in her book, \"Black Frankenstein: The Making of an American Metaphor\". In Young's book, she argues that the Frankenstein monster \"refuses to accept his placelessness\". The idea of the Frankenstein monster can be appropriated to African Americans as an idea where the monster is placed in an unknown land and society, and he must react violently to escape the treachery of that society. That metaphor is embraced by the African American community because of how they were forced into a society where they were treated as monsters. In the case of this film,however, the monster is a white man navigating a black world in Watts. The metaphor of the film is complicated further as it is a monster who changes from being black to white.",

After the change of directors to James Whale, along with a major script and conceptual revision, the virtually unknown Boris Karloff was then cast in his star-making role.

Their joy is tempered by the realization that Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is also apparently dead.

He falls into a flooded pit underneath the mill, where the Monster\u00a0\u2013 having survived the fire\u00a0\u2013 strangles him. Hauling himself from the pit, the Monster casts Hans' wife (Mary Gordon) to her death. He next encounters Minnie (Una O'Connor), who flees in terror.",

Influenced by the concept of the giant Frankenstein monster from the \"King Kong vs. Prometheus\" story, Toho planned on making \"Frankenstein vs. Godzilla\" as a follow up to \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\". Written in 1963 by Kimura, the story dealt with the heart of the original Frankenstein monster becoming irradiated and growing into a Frankenstein-monster giant. Afraid the giant would start eating people, Godzilla would be freed from an icy prison by the JSDF and goaded into a fight with the monster in hopes of killing him. Even though \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\" had already been made with Godzilla escaping from an iceberg that he was trapped in at the end of \"Godzilla Raids Again\", script writer Mabuchi thought with Godzilla disappearing into the ocean at the end of that film, that the idea of Godzilla becoming frozen in the North Sea into another icy prison could still work. The story would end with natural disasters defeating the monsters as Godzilla disappears into a raging river flow, and the Frankenstein giant disappears into magma caused by an erupting volcano.",

Robert Christgau remarked that because many of Manhattan's white youths were wealthy and somewhat artsy, only ill-behaved young people from the outer boroughs such as the band members could \"capture the oppressive excitement Manhattan holds for a half-formed human being\". \"Private World\", an escapist plea for stability, was co-written by Kane, who rarely contributed as a songwriter and felt overwhelmed as a young adult in the music business. Johansen, the band's main lyricist, said \"Frankenstein (Orig.)\" was about \"how kids come to Manhattan from all over, they're kind of like whipped dogs, they're very repressed. Their bodies and brains are disoriented from each other\u00a0... it's a love song.\" According to critic Frank Kogan, the titular monster in the song was the personification of New York City and its ethos\u2014\"the ostentation and the terror, the dreams and the fear\"\u2014while Johansen asking listeners if they \"could make it with Frankenstein\" involved more than sexual slang: \"David was asking if you\u2014if I\u2014could make it with the monster of life, whether I could embrace life in all its pain and dreams and disaster.\" Sylvain jokingly said \"Frankenstein (Orig.)\" was titled with a qualifier because rock musician Edgar Winter had released his 1973 song of the same name before the band could record their own: \"Our song 'Frankenstein' was a big hit in our live show\u00a0... Now, his thing didn't sound at all like ours, but I'm sure he stole our title.\"",

The two men would continue to work together in many films for Hammer, and their names became synonymous with the company. Cushing reprised the role of Baron Victor Frankenstein in five sequels. In the first, \"The Revenge of Frankenstein\" (1958), his protagonist is sentenced to death by guillotine, but he flees and hides under the alias Doctor Victor Stein. He returned for \"The Evil of Frankenstein\" (1963), where the Baron has a carnival hypnotist resurrect his monster's inactive brain, and \"Frankenstein Created Woman\" (1967), in which the Frankenstein's monster is a woman played by \"Playboy\" magazine centrefold model Susan Denberg. Cushing played the lead role twice more in \"Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed\" (1969) and \"Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell\" (1974). The former film portrays Frankenstein as a far more ruthless character than had been seen before, and features a scene in which Cushing's Frankenstein rapes the character played by Veronica Carlson. Neither Carlson nor Cushing wanted to do the scene, filmed despite director Terence Fisher\u2019s objections, and the controversial sequence was edited out of the film for its American release. In \"Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell\", Cushing portrayed Frankenstein as having gone completely mad, in a fitting coda to the previous movies.",
