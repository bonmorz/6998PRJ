He was selected as an All-American in 1894 and 1895 while playing for the University of Pennsylvania. Penn was undefeated and won the national championship of football in the two seasons that Brooke was named an All-American. All-American selector, Caspar Whitney called Brooke a \"very hard man to stop. He strikes the line with almost irresistible force.\" He was regarded as a ferocious fullback and a top notch punter. He is credited with coining the phrase \"coffin corner\" when describing his long punts deep into the opposing end of the field. Brooke was barred from playing for Pennsylvania after the 1895 season because of an agreement between Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania that limited players to four seasons. After finishing a bachelor's degree from Pennsylvania, Brooke was the subject of an allegation of being an ineligible player in an October 24, 1896 game in New Orleans, LA. In the game, Brooke played only one down for Tulane University before LSU protested to the game's referee. Tulane claimed that Brooke planned on enrolling there as a graduate student. During the debate between team captains, Brooke refused to sign an affidavit stating his intention to enroll at Tulane, as he was already enrolled in law school at the University of Pennsylvania. The referee ruled him ineligible to play. The Tulane football team refused to continue playing the game without Brooke, so the referee ruled the game to be a forfeit in favor of LSU.",

Garrett set forth six extremely stringent conditions for acceptance of her gift: Garrett set the admission standards according to the highly-praised European standards of medical education. Gilman was very concerned about the more rigorous academic standards. In the late nineteenth century, most of the medical schools in the United States were \"small profit-making enterprises\" owned by the faculties. The medical schools sold medical degrees to whoever paid the tuition fee. No preliminary education was required for admission. When Harvard University and University of Pennsylvania raised the academic standards earlier, they faced a revenue drop as fewer students were qualified for admission. The precarious financial situation of Hopkins worried Gilman; he could not afford a new financial dilemma. He tried to convince Garrett to lower her standards, but failed. Through negotiations, Garret finally agreed to modify two paragraphs of her terms, emphasizing that her terms of gift \"would not interfere with the operation of the university.\" She also added that the university could modify the admission requirement, but the standard should remain the same. On February 20, 1893, she approved the statement and terms and signed the Requirements of Admission. By forcing the university to accept females on the same basis as males and increasing the admission requirements, Garrett made Johns Hopkins School of Medicine the first co-educational, graduate-level medical school in the United States.",

Hansen has commented on the relationship between the liberal arts and the U.S. business sector in letters to the editor, opinion editorials and articles. She has dismissed arguments brought forward by academics issuing that liberal arts colleges tend to disparage and undermine students who wish to participate in fields such as finance, business, and accounting. Author and 27th president of Dickinson College, William G. Durden charged liberal arts leaders with creating an elitist, \u201cseparatist\u201d perspective. Hansen rejected this charge citing the \"intellectual and ethical virtues fostered by their undergraduate experience\" as a key to their success. She was quoted as saying:Rather than faulting liberal education for failing to prevent greed and corruption in corporate America, we need to do a better job of communicating what the CEOs who prefer to hire liberal arts graduates already know: Although our expertise rests in academic disciplines and our worth to society has much to do with the intrinsic human need to learn, we have many \u201cpractical\u201d programs, and access to the broad learning achieved through a liberal education gives our graduates a realistic understanding of the complexity of the world and prepares them for lives satisfying to themselves and useful to others.Hansen has at times criticized collegiate admission practices stating that although restructuring the admissions platforms most universities use are generally agreed upon, how one is to do this is highly debatable. The shift from de-emphasizing individual performance and achievement, to general \u201cauthentically chosen\u201d activities generating \u201cemotional and ethical awareness and skills,\" is, according to Hansen, \"doing more harm than good.\" She refuted a report issued by the Harvard School of Education which asserted that colleges and universities will have a better pool of students should they choose to admit students based on group activities, putting less value on individual contribution. Hansen asserts that implementing admission standards that focus on these metrics \"invites only skepticism and confusion.\" She notes that admission officers can't reasonably deduce whether a student has an appropriate level of gratitude from a supplementary essay. To implement these subjective metrics would mean dramatic changes to the culture and pedagogy of universities. Hansen states that low-income students can't easily find the specific jobs and work experience required of them to fill subjective and speculative metrics. She goes on to state that \"we know too little about how and when to identify, characterize, measure and develop the so-called noncognitive aspects of learning that this report asks colleges to evaluate. And I disagree that the gateway to college is the time or place to subject young people to the full impact of our ignorance about how to fairly assess things they should still be questioning and exploring -- like character, feelings, motives and values.\"",

Generally, Public Universities conduct their admission in unified system of two as of 2017. Public Nationwide admissions to Public universities are subsidied by the government and students who succeed to enter university from one of the two schemes will enjoy lower to free university program fees. The first alternative is SNMPTN (Seleksi Nasional Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri-Unified National Public Universities Admission). SNMPTN is a university admission scheme based on academic performances during the years of Senior High School. This selection system is designed only for students graduating during that respective year only. SNMPTN selection considers a few criteria such as student's academic grades and performances, achievements, stream or type of class (sciene or social, AP or Regular) and originating high school. However, not all senior students can apply, usually only 50% of the graduating class may apply for an 'A' accredited school and lower quotas for other accreditations. According to the law of the Ministry of Higher Education, the total holding admission into a public university should at least be 30% from SNMPTN; each university may allocate more. The second alternative is SBMPTN (Seleksi Bersama Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri-Unified Public Universities Admission Examination). SBMPTN is a university admission where you take two or three tests (aptitude test, natural science test, and/or social science test), applicants will also be required to submit into a practical session if the chosen major is art, music, or physical education. You also choose 3 different majors and/or universities. This examination is held nationwide once a year and unlike SNMPTN, is open to high school graduates of the last 3 years. Many students repeat or take gap years to retake the SBMPTN to get into their wanted university. According to the Ministry of Higher Education, minimum 30% of the entire public university quota should admit from SBMPTN. However, most public universities allocate 60% and above for SBMPTN due to the constantly high success rate of students who were accepted from this scheme. SBMPTN is known for its very difficult questions and challenging time-management difficulties. The exam is also held CBT (Computer-Based) starting of last year. Most universities are conducting independent selection mechanism on their own beside SNMPTN and SBMPTN such as SIMAK or PPKB from Universitas Indonesia or UTUL from Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM). These are called special programs as they tend to be more expensive due to the incentive that these programs are not under government subsidies. Meanwhile, Private Universities usually do their admission before and after Public Universities Admission. They sometimes do several admissions. Governmental Agency Institutions does their admission independently (not included in Unified National Public Universities Admission) and will usually have their own scheme for selection.",

Farrand\u2019s is the warmest, expressing the hope that \u201cit will also excite a disposition for tale telling among the whole body of the alumni\u2026\u201d Perhaps reflecting the fact that his first departure from the University was, to some extent, welcomed if not required by the Regents, Ten Brook\u2019s account is the most critical of the Regents (who would force him out of the Librarian position just one year after his account was published). Differences can be seen in their accounts of one of the most famous episodes in the University\u2019s early history, the hiring and firing of the visionary, if somewhat imperious, first president, Henry P. Tappan. All historians of the University have seen the hiring of Tappan in 1852 as a bold and fortunate stroke by the Regents and his firing without notice by another board in 1863 as unfortunate and badly handled at least. Ten Brook, who was not on campus at the same time as Tappan spends the least amount of time on this period; Adams, who was both student and faculty member under Tappan writes admiringly of his accomplishments, but emphasizes the smooth transition to his successor, Erastus Haven as a tribute to the continuing strength of the University. Farrand offers the most detailed and balanced account of this period, albeit from the standpoint that his accomplishments were many and his departure unfortunate. Ten Brooks is the most dubious about the admission of women, Adams the briefest, Farrand the most thorough, concluding that for the female students \u201cit was unpleasant to be looked upon as eccentric, but that was a trifling matter when compared with the satisfaction arising from each day\u2019s achievement.\u201d Farrand\u2019s account also has the most to say about the extracurricular activities of students in the period, again, because it is based in reading of the various student publications. The strengths of her work in documentary evidence at times become a weakness, as does her organization of her account by Presidential administration. As has been typical of all other accounts of the University\u2019s history there is no overarching interpretive theme to her account and topics appear to be longer or shorter depending on their documentation. Long quotations from documents can be extremely valuable today, but her account contains many of these which make for less smooth reading. But, on balance, hers is the most comprehensive and balanced account of the three. Only one review of her book was published in its own time (a not untypical number at a time when outlets for book reviews were few) and that declared the book provided \"circumstantial fidelity.\" Although a very rough proxy for influence, Google Scholar in 2015 reports 20 citations to her work (more than to either Ten Brook or Adams) in works that are themselves cited 884 times.",

The qualifications needed for admission vary by university. Some universities require a high GPA and test score. Students with a GPA and test score lower than required cannot apply for admission to that university. Some faculties may add an aptitude test. It depends on the faculty and the university. Students are not required to take the every subject area examination. For example, the faculty of engineering requires mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, but the faculty of management requires English and mathematics. This is a departure from the original admission system which requires a score in every subject of the O-net test and academic aptitude test (PAT).",
