Thus it is the challenge of competition in relation to testosterone among males of the species that facilitates aggression and violence. Studies conducted have found direct correlation between testosterone and dominance especially among the most violent criminals in prison who had the highest testosterone levels. The same research also found fathers (those outside competitive environments) had the lowest testosterone levels compared to other males. The second theory is also similar and is known as the evolutionary neuroandrogenic (ENA) theory of male aggression. Testosterone and other androgens have evolved to masculinize a brain in order to be competitive even as far as being a risk to harming others. By doing so, individuals with masculinized brains as a result of pre-natal and adult life testosterone and androgens enhance their resource acquiring abilities in order to survive, attract and copulate with mates as much as possible. Thus, crime can be seen as an extreme form of adaptation to gain status and acquire more resources.

Testosterone undecanoate is a testosterone ester and a prodrug of testosterone in the body. Because of this, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of testosterone. Testosterone undecanoate was introduced in China for use by injection and in Europe for use by mouth in the 1970s. It became available for use by injection in Europe in the early to mid 2000s and in the United States in 2014. A formulation for use by mouth is not currently available in the United States but is pending approval as of 2018. Along with testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate, testosterone undecanoate is one of the most widely used testosterone esters. However, it has advantages over other testosterone esters in that it can be taken by mouth and in that it has a far longer duration when given by injection. In addition to its medical use, testosterone undecanoate is used to improve physique and performance. The drug is a controlled substance in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit.",
