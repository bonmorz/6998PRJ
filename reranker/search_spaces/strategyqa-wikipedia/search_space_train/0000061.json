Other \"retiarius\" tricks were to whip the net at his opponent's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him. The helmet of the \"secutor\" was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net. In most cases, the \"secutor\" knew to expect the net-man's tactics and tried to intercept and hold on to the weapon, possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net. In such danger, the \"retiarius\" could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger. The \"secutor\" stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it. Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the \"retiarius\" used his net. Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net, yet the class is named for the device, and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a \"retiarius\" in his satires. The discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance, and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict. The lack of nets in \"retiarius\" images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility is that some \"retiarii\" simply did not use nets. In most bouts, the \"retiarius\" probably had to resort to fighting with just his trident and dagger, placing him at a disadvantage. The trident was his primary weapon in such situations, and its length allowed the \"retiarius\" to keep his opponent at bay. He held the weapon two-handed, left nearer the prongs, so that he could parry his enemy's strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends. Wielded two-handed, the weapon could land powerful blows. Images show \"retiarii\" stabbing downward at the \"secutor\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s unshielded legs or stabbing down at the helmet in an attempt to poke through an eyehole. The trident itself was too weak to pierce the metal, although a skull found at Ephesus, Turkey, dating to CE\u00a0200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to the head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent. The \"secutor\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s helmet was rounded and free of protrusions to avoid snaring the net or being caught in the trident's prongs, but attacks on it forced the \"secutor\" to duck or hide behind his shield. This reduced his field of vision and gave the \"retiarius\" an advantage with his speed. Should the \"secutor\" strike with his sword, the \"retiarius\" parried with the trident prongs and attempted to disarm him. Likewise, the more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block the trident with his shield and force the net-man to lose it. Another type of gladiator, scissor could also be pitted against a \"retiarius\". Images from the Eastern Roman Empire show \"scissores\" wearing a tubular arm-guard in lieu of a shield. The guard fits over the left hand and ends in a hooked, knife-like blade that was probably intended to parry the net and trident or to snag and pull away the net. \"Scissores\" who succeeded in this probably dropped the hook weapon and fought with just a sword.",

This style of fighting was often used by peasants and commoners for whom the staff was a domestic tool and a convenient implement of self-defense.

This grip lends itself to thrusting attacks aimed at the vital points (\"marma\"), done by pushing the weapon forward with the back hand through the front hand, though it also incorporates \"barta\", techniques in which both ends are used to attack.

Kohn in his book \"As We Know It\" wrote that the hand axe is \"a highly visible indicator of fitness, and so becomes a criterion of mate choice.\" Miller followed their example and said that hand axes have characteristics that make them subject to sexual selection, such as that they were made for over a million years throughout Africa, Europe and Asia, they were made in large numbers, and most were impractical for utilitarian use. He claimed that a single design persisting across time and space cannot be explained by cultural imitation and draws a parallel between bowerbirds' bowers (built to attract potential mates and used only during courtship) and Pleistocene hominids' hand axes. He called hand axe building a \"genetically inherited propensity to construct a certain type of object.\" He discards the idea that they were used as missile weapons because more efficient weapons were available, such as javelins. Although he accepted that some hand axes may have been used for practical purposes, he agreed with Kohn and Mithen who showed that many hand axes show considerable skill, design and symmetry beyond that needed for utility. Some were too big, such as the hand axe found in Furze Platt, England that is over a foot long. Some were too small - less than two inches. Some feature symmetry beyond practical requirements and show evidence of unnecessary attention to form and finish. Miller thinks that the most important clue is that under electron microscopy hand axes show no signs of use or evidence of edge wear. Furthermore, hand axes can be good handicaps in Zahavi's handicap principle theory: learning costs are high, risks of injury, they require physical strength, hand-eye coordination, planning, patience, pain tolerance and resistance to infection from cuts and bruises when making or using such a hand axe.",

In the first half of season one, there were four safe zones consisting of a pillbox (where the contender started the event, weapon in hand), a burnt out building, a thatch bush, and two oil drums, and four weapons (see chart below). If the contenders hit the bull's eye on the target, which was located at the foot of the Gladiator's platform, they would receive 100 points. Hitting the outer rim was worth less points, originally 60 and rising to 75 by the end of the season. If the contenders failed to hit the target in four tries but still had time on the clock, they could earn 30 points and a draw by taking cover in the last safe zone and avoiding being hit.",

In fact, the use of the off-hand as a defensive measure is often prohibited by the rules of many sport fighting styles that are common in the Western world today. However, in HEMA (historical European martial arts) Rapier and Dagger is a common sparring method, and backsword and dagger is also practised. Another exception is kendo where the use of two shinai of different size is allowed but uncommon; this style is known as nito-ryu (literally \"two sword-style\"). Several other fighting styles not only incorporate but even promote off-hand weapons, for example the Filipino style eskrima. Simultaneous use of two weapons is also frequently featured in fiction, particularly in video games, literature, and other media from the fantasy genre, where it is commonly dubbed \"dual wielding\". In the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA), rapier combat makes use of various forms of off-hand device, including parrying daggers, batons, cloaks, and a second sword, which in fencing is termed a \"case of rapier\".",

The Crusaders are notably more focused on offensive abilities than Paladins or Templars, capable of both using weapon-based attacks up close and cast holy magic from a distance. The Crusaders' class-specific weapon is a flail, which comes in one-handed or two-handed versions.

The tactical advantage here is lost with closed bolt weapons that do not have a round in the chamber, as the gun will then require cocking with the new magazine inserted to chamber the new rounds.
