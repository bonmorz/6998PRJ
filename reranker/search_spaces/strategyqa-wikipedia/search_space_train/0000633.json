These doctors argued that the post-mortem finding of a transected ulnar artery could not have caused a degree of blood loss that would kill someone, particularly when outside in the cold (where vasoconstriction would cause slow blood loss). Further, this conflicted with the minimal amount of blood found at the scene. They also contended that the amount of co-proxamol found was only about a third of what would normally be fatal.

For example, it could be as simple as someone saying that \"life is not worth living any more\" or it can be extreme as \"I'm going to kill myself by jumping off a bridge.\" Parasuicide is when someone causes deliberate harm to themselves. For example, if someone were to take an overdose of medicine and live. Self-destructive behaviors are anything that cause harm to oneself. This can be intentional or unintentional. Some examples are alcoholism, risky sports, some sexual disorders, and eating disorders. By way of a suicide note the person who is suiciding has the last word. It is also a way for the person to explain, bring closure (or not), to give guilt, to dictate wishes, to control, to forgive or to blame. Here is a list of the parts that might go into a suicide note. One of the first to contribute to the study of suicidology is Edwin S. Shneidman. Edwin Shneidman is considered to be the father of suicidology. Shneidman's definition of suicide is a conscious act of self-induced annihilation, best understood as a multidimensional malaise in a needful individual who defines an issue for which suicide is perceived as the best solution. He thought of suicide as psychache or intolerable psychological pain. Another notable person in the field of suicidology is Emile Durkheim. To Durkheim the word suicide is applied to all cases of death resulting directly or indirectly from a positive or negative act of the victim himself, which he knows will produce this result. Basically he saw suicide as an external and constraining social fact independent of individual psychopathology. In David J. Mayo's definition there were four elements to suicide. The first element: A suicide has taken place only if a death has occurred. The second element: The death must be of one's own doing. The third element: The agency of suicide can be active or passive and, lastly, it implies intentionally ending one's own life. Sigmund Freud and Karl Menninger had similar views on suicide. Their definition of suicide had three different aspects. One was a murder involving hatred or the wish to kill. The second one was a murder by the self often involving guilt or the wish to be killed. The last one is the wish to die. They thought of suicide being a murderous death wish that was turned back upon one's own self. Sigmund Freud also believed that we had two opposing basic instincts\u2014life (eros) and death (thanatos)\u2014and all instincts sought tension reduction. He also believed that suicide is more likely in advanced civilizations requiring greater repression of sexual and aggressive energy. Jean Baechler's definition of suicide was that suicide denotes all behavior that seeks and finds the solution to an existential problem by making an attempt on the life of the subject. Another worker in the field of suicidology was Joseph H. Davis. The definition he gave for suicide was a suicide is a fatal willful self-inflicted life-threatening act without apparent desire to live; implicit are two basic components lethality and intent. Albert Camus also did some work in this field. He believed that whether one can live or chooses to live is the only truly serious philosophical problem. He also claimed that man created a god in order to be able to live without a wish to kill himself and that the only human liberty is to come to terms with death. He introduced Darwinian thought into his teachings.",

Today, even though suicide is considered a public health issue by advocates, the general public often still consider it a private shame; a final desperate solution for the emotionally weak. It is stigmatized in the public perception by being associated with weakness, a \u201ccry for attention,\u201d shame, and depression, without understanding the contributing factors. There can be a visceral and emotional reaction to suicide rather than an attempt to understand it. This reaction is based on stereotypes (overgeneralizations about a group: weak or crazy), prejudices (agreement with stereotypical beliefs and related emotional reactions: Sue attempted suicide; \u2018I\u2019m afraid of her\u2019), and discrimination (unfair behavior towards the suicidal individual or group: avoidance; \u2018suicidal persons should be locked up\u2019). Erving Goffman defined courtesy stigma as the discrimination, prejudice and stereotypes which family and friends experience as suicide survivors. Public stigma is felt by medical professionals whose clients die by suicide and whose treatment is then questioned by colleagues and in lawsuits, often contributing to their being less inclined to work with suicidal patients. Property can also be stigmatized by suicide: property sellers in certain jurisdictions in the United States, in California for example, are required by law to reveal if a suicide or murder occurred on the premises in the past three years, putting suicide in the same category as homicide. These issues compound and perpetuate the public stigma of suicide, exacerbating the inclination for suicidal individuals, and their family and friends, to bury their experiences, creating a barrier to care.",

            "document": "Suicide . Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, and substance abuse \u2014 including alcoholism and the use of benzodiazepines. Other suicides are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at a higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide \u2014 such as firearms, drugs, and poisons; treating mental disorders and substance misuse; proper media reporting of suicide; and improving economic conditions. Even though crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods of suicide include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicides resulted in 828,000 global deaths in 2015, an increase from 712,000 deaths in 1990. This makes suicide the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5-1.4% of people die by suicide, roughly 12 per 100,000 individuals per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries, those aged between 15 and 30 are at the highest risk. Europe had the highest rates of suicide by region in 2015. There are an estimated 10 to 20\u00a0million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and in females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide as an offense towards God, due to the belief in the sanctity of life. During the samurai era in Japan, a form of suicide known as seppuku (\"harakiri\") was respected as a means of making up for failure or as a form of protest. Sati, a practice outlawed by the British Raj, expected the Indian widow to kill herself on her husband's funeral fire, either willingly or under pressure from her family and society. Suicide and attempted suicide, while previously illegal, are no longer so in most Western countries. It remains a criminal offense in many countries. In the 20th and 21st centuries, suicide has been used on rare occasions as a form of protest, and kamikaze and suicide bombings have been used as a military or terrorist tactic.",

Once the stigmas have been overcome, there is an increased possibility that education, medical care and support can provide a critical framework for those at risk. Lack of information, awareness of professional services, judgment and insensitivity from religious groups, and financial strain have all been identified as barriers to support access for those youth in suicidal crisis. The critical framework is a necessary component to implementing suicide awareness and suicide prevention, and breaking down these barriers. <br> Awareness can focus on the individual with social and non-threatening education (introduced at schools as a foundational program for all adolescents), and on the public and societal level, encompassing media across all platforms to destigmatize suicide and its perpetuation. Education for the individual and public raises awareness to the protective factors that may assist in suicide risk reduction. <br> Protective factors are characteristics or conditions that may have a positive effect on youth and reduce the possibility of suicide attempts. These factors have not been studied in as much depth as risk factors, so there is less research. They include:  \u2022 Receiving effective mental health care \u2022 Positive social connections and support with family and peers provides coping skills \u2022 Participation in community and social groups (i.e. religious) that foster resilience \u2022 Optimism enables youth to engage and acquire adaptive skills in reinterpreting adverse experiences to find meaning and benefit \u2022 Life satisfaction, spiritual wellbeing and/or belief that a person can survive beyond their pain is protective against suicide \u2022 Resiliency based on adaptive coping skills has can reduce suicide risk, and research suggests these skills can be taught \u2022 Finding hope can be a key protective factor and a catalyst for the recovery process. It is important to note, however, that in-depth training is paramount for those involved in any service that looks to the awareness and needs of those touched by suicide. In a world where social media drives both the activities and knowledge for today\u2019s youth, it is important that there is a constructive discourse on the subject of suicide, rather than glamorizing it as an aspect of storytelling. Constructive social media is illustrated in the documentary \u201cThe S Word movie\u201d which presents suicide attempt survivors and their stories. It is the mission of the film to uncover personal survivors\u2019 accounts of their conflicts, highlighting their courage, insight and humor. The film aims to create a national community transforming personal struggles into positive action. This project is considered constructive to suicide awareness as, historically, suicide attempt survivors have either not come forward to speak out, or have done so anonymously. This documentary, created by a suicide attempt survivor, encourages them to talk openly of their experiences, so that others can learn from exploring a world that has been stigmatized for too long. Suicide awareness and prevention have in the past only relied on research from clinical observation. In bringing insights, intimate experience, and real-world wisdom of suicide attempt survivors to the table, professionals, educators, other survivors and suicide attempt survivors can learn firsthand from their \u201clived experience.\u201d",

The most frequently cited risk factors for suicide are: Over 90 percent of suicides in the United States are a result of mental illness and/or alcohol and substance abuse, but 10 percent of those who die by suicide do not have any psychologically-known diagnosis. Youth vulnerability to suicide is compounded by the increased levels of impulsivity, more than other age groups, as reported by the United States Institute of Medicine. This can be attributed to neurological and cognitive changes in adolescent brain function, stimulated by a rapid increase in dopamine during puberty. It is also suggested this impulsive, risk-taking behavior is often associated with the early use of alcohol and illegal substances.
