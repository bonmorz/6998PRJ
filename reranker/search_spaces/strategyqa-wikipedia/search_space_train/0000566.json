George Selgin, an expert on free banking theory, expounds on value proposition of bitcoin in regard to the inability to control its supply (ie inflation targeting):It doesn\u2019t follow, however, that either Bitcoins\u2019 purchasing power or the volume of Bitcoin-denominated payments will be stable enough to make Bitcoins anyone\u2019s idea of a sound money. Because it makes no allowances for changes in the real demand for Bitcoins, whatever their source, the strict \u201cprotocol\u201d that regulates the supply of Bitcoins\u2014a protocol that raises Bitcoin \u201cmining\u201d costs in response to changes in mining activity and technology, but without regard to Bitcoins\u2019 purchasing power\u2014would allow fluctuations in the pure transactions demand for Bitcoins to continue to influence their purchasing power. As the number approaches 21 million, mining rewards will approach zero, and Bitcoin output with cease once and for all. The transactions demand for Bitcoins will, in contrast, tend to go on increasing with economic growth. A Bitcoin standard would thus tend to result in a rate of deflation at least equal to the rate of economic growth, with occasional bouts of more severe deflation occurring with every cyclical increase in the demand for money. Although (as I\u2019ve argued elsewhere) deflation needn\u2019t go hand-in-hand with recession or depression so long as the rate of deflation reflects an economy\u2019s (total factor) productivity growth rate, chances are that deflation in a Bitcoin economy would frequently exceed this safe limit.Because bitcoin's supply was predetermined at inception and considered unchangeable it cannot fluctuate with the demand cycles and thus Selgin suggests it cannot be made very stable in regard to its purchasing power. However, this still leaves the possibility that bitcoin fits Nash's concept of \"Asymptotically Ideal Money\". Whether Nash was specifically referring to bitcoin or not it still might have the same effect and lead to the intended result of international stability of the existing legacy fiat currencies (and possibly in relation to bitcoin).",

In early 1803, diplomat James Monroe was sent to France to negotiate purchasing Louisiana from France. Louisiana was bought from France later that year. This was known as the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States. The northeastern part of Texas was thought to be included in the purchase. There was no official border between Louisiana and Texas, which caused disputes between Spain and the United States. In 1806, United States General James Wilkinson and Spanish Lieutenant Colonel Sim\u00f3n de Herrera attempted to negotiate establishing a border between the two nations. On November 5, 1806, an agreement was made to establish a Neutral territory between the two countries. The neutral territory did not have official borders, and the Caddo Lake area was likely located within the territory. Because the territory was not possessed by either nation, neither of them could enforce laws in the territory, so it became popular with outlaws and escaped slaves. In both 1810 and 1812, the two nations sent joint military expeditions into the Neutral Territory to expel the outlaws inhabiting it.",

As the number approaches 21 million, mining rewards will approach zero, and Bitcoin output with cease once and for all. The transactions demand for Bitcoins will, in contrast, tend to go on increasing with economic growth. A Bitcoin standard would thus tend to result in a rate of deflation at least equal to the rate of economic growth, with occasional bouts of more severe deflation occurring with every cyclical increase in the demand for money. Although (as I\u2019ve argued elsewhere) deflation needn\u2019t go hand-in-hand with recession or depression so long as the rate of deflation reflects an economy\u2019s (total factor) productivity growth rate, chances are that deflation in a Bitcoin economy would frequently exceed this safe limit.Because bitcoin's supply was predetermined at inception and considered unchangeable it cannot fluctuate with the demand cycles and thus Selgin suggests it cannot be made very stable in regard to its purchasing power. However, this still leaves the possibility that bitcoin fits Nash's concept of \"Asymptotically Ideal Money\". Whether Nash was specifically referring to bitcoin or not it still might have the same effect and lead to the intended result of international stability of the existing legacy fiat currencies (and possibly in relation to bitcoin).",
