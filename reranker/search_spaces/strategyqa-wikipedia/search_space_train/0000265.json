He sculpted the creature's body using plasticine, incorporating pieces such as vertebrae from snakes and cooling tubes from a Rolls-Royce. The creature's head was manufactured separately by Carlo Rambaldi, who had worked on the aliens in \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". Rambaldi followed Giger's designs closely, making some modifications in order to incorporate the moving parts which would animate the jaw and inner mouth. A system of hinges and cables was used to operate the creature's rigid tongue, which protruded from its mouth and featured a second mouth at its tip with its own set of movable teeth. The final head had about 900 moving parts and points of articulation. Part of a human skull was used as the \"face\", and was hidden under the smooth, translucent cover of the head. Rambaldi's original Alien jaw is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution, while in April 2007 the original Alien suit was sold at auction. Copious amounts of K-Y Jelly were used to simulate saliva and to give the Alien an overall slimy appearance. The creature's vocalizations were provided by Percy Edwards, a voice artist famous for providing bird sounds for British television throughout the 1960s and 1970s as well as the whale sounds for \"Orca: Killer Whale\" (1977).",

Giger also gave the Alien's mouth a second inner set of pharyngeal jaws located at the tip of a long, tongue-like proboscis which could extend rapidly for use as a weapon. His design for the creature was heavily influenced by an aesthetic he had created and termed \"biomechanical\", a fusion of the organic and the mechanic. His mock-up of the Alien was created using parts from an old Rolls Royce car, rib bones and the vertebrae from a snake, molded with plasticine. The Alien's animatronic head, which contained 900 moving parts, was designed and constructed by special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. Giger and Rambaldi together would win the 1980 Academy Award for Visual Effects for their design of the Alien. Scott decided on the man-in-suit approach for creating the creature onscreen. Initially circus performers were tried, then multiple actors together in the same costume, but neither proved scary. Deciding that the creature would be scarier the closer it appeared to a human, Scott decided that a single, very tall, very thin man be used. Scott was inspired by a photograph of Leni Riefenstahl standing next to a 6'4\" (1.93 m) Nubian. The casting director found 6'10\" (2.08 m), rail-thin graphic designer Bolaji Badejo in a local pub.

He notices first that \u2018man is a biological being with a physical body\u2019, which is the \u2018less than God\u2019, as we think of \u2018God as a being of pure spirit, lifted above the categories of time and space\u2019. The psalmist would then say that God made man that way, and because of this \u2018there is nothing wrong with it\u2019 and that \u2018everything God makes is good; therefore there is nothing wrong with it\u2019. The Greeks, as King informs us, \u2018felt the body was evil\u2019 and that the \u2018soul could never reach its full maturity until it broke loose from the prison of the body\u2019. However, Christianity raises the view that \u2018the body is not the principle of evil; it says the will is the principle of evil\u2019. He then defines that in \u2018any doctrine of man, we must be concerned with man's physical well being\u2019. To support this he brings up Jesus` quote that we need the \u201cbread\u201d to survive and also states \u2018this isn\u2019t the only part\u2019 and if we stop here we would see \u2018man merely as an animal\u2019. He then brings an example of chemists who calculated that the values of man came to \u2018about ninety-eight cents\u2019, today with our living standards it comes to \u2018a dollar ninety eight for the average man\u2019. King challenges this idea by questioning \u2018But can we explain the whole of man in terms of ninety eight cents?\u2019 and brings up examples of human genius; and again asks \u2018Can we explain the mystery of the human soul in terms of ninety eight cents?\u2019 To this he answers \u201cno\u201d and states that \u2018man is a child of God\u2019 and raises the second basic point of the doctrine \u2018that man is a being of spirit\u2019, which is the \u2018thou has crowned him with glory and honour\u2019, and because of our \u2018rational capacity, man has a mind, man can reason. This distinguishes us from the lower animals\u2019. King then defines man as \u2018God\u2019s marvellous creation. Through his mind he can leap oceans, break through walls, and transcend the categories of time and space\u2019. With this he defines what the biblical writers meant when they said \u2018man is made in the image of God\u2019, and that he has \u2018rational capacity; he has the unique ability to have a fellowship with God. Man is a being of spirit\u2019.",

The final head had about 900 moving parts and points of articulation. Part of a human skull was used as the \"face\", and was hidden under the smooth, translucent cover of the head. Rambaldi's original Alien jaw is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution, while in April 2007 the original Alien suit was sold at auction. Copious amounts of K-Y Jelly were used to simulate saliva and to give the Alien an overall slimy appearance.

The animal relies on the orientation of its head for aim. When fully extended, the tongue can reach , longer than the length of the skull. The buccinators allow it to slide back in without losing attached food and tighten the mouth to prevent food from escaping as it extends. When retracted, the tongue is held in the oropharynx by the secondary palate, preventing it from blocking respiration. This retraction is aided by the long sternoglossus muscle, which is formed by the fusion of the sternohyoid and the hyoglossus, and does not attach to the hyoid. Thus, the tongue is directly anchored to the sternum.",

It is symptomatic of our relationship with the natural world itself. As Mark Cocker in his review of these pieces, writes: It may seem absurd today. But perhaps we should reflect that in 1997 the Labour government offered a series of indices to measure the quality of life in this country. One of those yardsticks for the good life in Britain was bird populations. We are all now familiar how birds act as indicators for the quality of our environment. The owl, whose cry pierces the darkness, or the kestrel which wrestles the wind to a standstill at the motorway verge, will only survive if the trees, the insects, the other animals, the flowers and the countryside itself are all present and correct.

Salzer began to excavate the site in 1982, eight years after it had been rediscovered. He identified Panel 5 to be of special interest, since it is a composition containing several figures that seem to be engaged in a single action. Panel 5 is dated with a good measure of confidence to the tenth century A.D. At the outset, Robert L. Hall, the leader in the field, pointed out to Selzer that one of the figures in Panel 5 appeared to have attributes associated with the Red Horn mythology. The character in your Fig. 4 has a pattern around each nipple which resembles the long-nose god maskettes. The face[s] of the maskettes are of the same outline as that found around each nipple on the pictograph. I first interpreted the two parallel lines above the \"face\" outline as the red horn. I now feel that they represent the long nose of the long-nosed god in a face-on perspective which the artists could not quite handle. That leaves the nipples for the mouth and tongue, and remember that the little faces stuck out their tongues when manipulated. The stone Big Boy pipe from Spiro had long-nose god maskettes on each ear, and I would guess that is what Red Horn also wore on his ears and was the reason he was called He-who-wears-human-heads-as-earrings.  Salzer identified the other figures as being two giants, one of whom was the woman that eventually married Red Horn, and other pictographs seemed to be of Turtle and Storms-as-He-Walks, all of whom had gathered together on the occasion of the great lacrosse game between the good spirits and the giants. Salzer believes, contrary to Hall, that the figure to the far right is not a son of Red Horn, but Red Horn himself. The reason why we do not see prosopic earpieces is that part of the tail of the bird in the center of the panel has been painted over Red Horn's ears. Most archaeologists have accepted the idea that the panel is devoted to Red Horn mythology, although a few others have been highly skeptical.",

The Human Psyche addresses and answers a host of highly significant questions relating to human existence and survival, at both the individuals and social level. Examples of some of these questions are as follows: What is the biological origin of consciousness, thought and intelligence? What is the relationship between emotions and instinct? How did the human psyche evolve from the brains of our animal relatives? What and where is the human mind? How is the human mind organized to produce different cognitive attributes and different personalities? Why do we need a God and where is the human soul? What conjures within us the experience of love or, alternatively, casts us into the oblivion of darkness? What are the origins of good and evil? How are these extremes of human experience represented in religion? How do we imagine things and how does our imagination differ from our dreams? Do all people think in the same way and, if not, are there greater differences between people from different societies, countries, cultures or races than between members of the same community? Where does belief and faith come from? What is the origin of racial conflict? Why is it so easy for politicians to persuade us to go to war? Why does the aggression of battle always result in rape, plunder and pillage? Are we motivated by our thoughts or our emotions? Is there any basis for the politically correct view that all humans have identical brains and that all behavioral and cultural diversity is learned? Why is it said that the longest road is that between the heart and the head?",

Using white as an example, when we define a color, we define it by association. Snow is white. Paper is white. A cow is white. But what is white? While we are saying things that are white, we are not defining what white is without qualification. Ousia is thus the answer to the question of \"what is being\" when the question is without qualification. The unqualified answer of what is white is the ousia of white.",

The parasite then replaces the fish's tongue by attaching its own body to the muscles of the tongue stub. It appears that the parasite does not cause much other damage to the host fish, but it has been reported by Lanzing and O'Connor (1975) that infested fish with two or more of the parasites are usually underweight. Once \"C. exigua\" replaces the tongue, some feed on the host's blood and many others feed on fish mucus. This is the only known case of a parasite assumed to be functionally replacing a host organ. When a host fish dies, \"C. exigua\" will detach itself from the tongue stub after some time, leave the fish's mouth cavity, and can then be seen clinging to its head or body externally. It is not fully known what then happens to the parasite in the wild.",

For early stage disease, a treatment strategy including both surgery and radiation therapy might be the best option, while for more advanced disease there may be a need to add chemotherapy.

Venerating the body of the martyr St. Beatrice at the Benedictine Convent of Perpetual Adoration, Clyde, Missouri in 1940: \"There, under the altar, enclosed in glass, lay the body of the Roman martyr, Beatrice. We bent our heads eagerly and peered under the glass, where, on silken pillows lay the glittering doll-like body of Saint Beatrice (which we later learned was not her real body but a wax figure encasing her bones). We gazed, fascinated by the rosy cheeked young girl lying there, wearing a richly brocaded and embroidered dress, looking as if she had just breathed her last breath. We stared at her head. Her brown curls were encircled by a filigree band; her pretty mouth was open. We could see her little white teeth and pink tongue. Her glassy eyes had rolled back into her head and were fixed as though staring into heaven. Her pretty head had fallen back onto a silken pillow. Above the gold brocaded collar band, her long, prettily arched neck revealed the bloody spot our eyes always sought in fearful anticipation. It was eternally there--the blood encrusted stab wound that had taken her life. Drops of her blood appeared still fresh on her neck and were caught in a gold chalice beside the pillow.",
