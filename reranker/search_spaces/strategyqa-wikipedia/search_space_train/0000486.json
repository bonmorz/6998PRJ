His work on \"Swan Lake\" was considered unsuccessful by the critics of the day but not necessarily unsuccessful by the theatre-going public\u2014after all, Reisinger's original production of \"Swan Lake\" was kept in the active repertoire of the Bolshoi Theatre for seven years and was performed over thirty times during a period when other ballets could not sustain even twenty performances.

This procedure enables the placement of a collapsible heart valve into the body via a tube-based delivery system (catheter) that can be inserted through multiple access routes, including either an incision in the leg (transfemoral), or in between the ribs and to be threaded up to the heart (transapical), or through the front of the chest and then through a small hole in the aorta (transaortic). The valve is designed to replace a patient\u2019s diseased native aortic valve without traditional open-heart surgery and while the heart continues to beat \u2013 avoiding the need to stop the patient\u2019s heart and connect them to a heart-lung machine that temporarily takes over the function of the heart and the patient\u2019s breathing during surgery (cardiopulmonary bypass). Edwards also manufactures products for vascular therapy along with hemodynamic monitoring devices for measuring cardiovascular performance during surgery and in the ICU. Hemodynamic monitoring is the measurement of blood circulation and cardiac function that allows clinicians to evaluate whether enough oxygen is being delivered to the organs and tissues. Among these is the Swan-Ganz catheter. Originally developed for patients with acute myocardial infarction, it is now used in anesthesia and critical care units. Healthcare providers use this monitoring to detect changes or problems in a patient\u2019s health, which allows for more informed, immediate treatment decisions. To facilitate on-pump cardiac surgery procedures through smaller incisions, Edwards also offers a cardiac surgery product line comprising soft tissue retractors, venous and arterial cannulae, aortic occlusion, venting, and coronary sinus catheters, as well as reusable instruments for performing minimally invasive valvular procedures.",

In the 1940s and 1950s, Canadian surgeon Wilfred Bigelow demonstrated in animal models that the length of time the brain could survive stopped blood circulation could be extended from 3 minutes to 10 minutes by cooling to 30\u00a0\u00b0C before circulation was stopped. He found that this time could be extended to 15 to 24 minutes at temperatures below 20\u00a0\u00b0C. He further found that at a temperature of 5\u00a0\u00b0C, groundhogs could endure two hours of stopped blood circulation without ill effects. This research was motivated by a desire to stop the heart from beating long enough to do surgery on the heart while it remained still. Since heart-lung machines, also known as cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), hadn't been invented yet, stopping the heart meant stopping blood circulation to the whole body, including the brain. The first heart surgery using hypothermia to provide a longer time that blood circulation through the whole body could be safely stopped was performed by F. John Lewis and Mansur Taufic at the University of Minnesota in 1952. In this procedure, the first successful open heart surgery, Lewis repaired an atrial septal defect in a 5-year-old girl during 5 minutes of total circulatory arrest at 28\u00a0\u00b0C. Many similar procedures were performed by Soviet heart surgeon, Eugene Meshalkin, in Novosibirsk during the 1960s. In these procedures, cooling was accomplished externally by applying cold water or melting ice to the surface of the body.",

In the hospital, the SP tube and external staples will be removed, after several days. The remaining two tubes will each be connected to collection bags worn on each leg and the patient is usually sent home like this. After sufficient healing, and another doctor's visit, the tube will be removed from the stoma. The patient will now begin to catheterize the pouch every two hours.

            "document": "Norm Smith . After two more disappointing seasons, heart disease compelled Smith to resign from Melbourne at the end of 1967. It was a sad year for the Smith family, as brother Len had succumbed to a heart attack just months before his adopted club Richmond won the premiership. Feeling sufficiently recovered, Smith surprised many by accepting an offer to coach South Melbourne in 1969. At Albert Park, Smith pulled off what was considered one of his best coaching performances by taking the down trodden Swans to the 1970 semi final, their first finals appearance since 1945. However, the under-resourced and under-confident Swans couldn't sustain the effort and finished last and second last in the next two years. Smith resigned after the 1972 season.",

            "document": "Sharad Panday . Bloodless heart surgery was pioneered by American surgeon Denton Cooley. It was also performed by doctor Jerome Kay in Los Angeles and the procedure soon spread around the world. Panday, who trained under the Canadian surgeon Wilfred Gordon Bigelow, adopted the technique and tailored it to Indian conditions. He performed bloodless open heart surgeries at KEM in the 1970s and 1980s. Bloodless heart surgery was cost-effective in India, as it did not require blood transfusions, reduced the chances of infection in case of infected blood, and further reduced postoperative costs. Bloodless heart surgery was also performed on Jehovah's Witnesses, as they refused donated blood.",
