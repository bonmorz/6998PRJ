His work on \"Swan Lake\" was considered unsuccessful by the critics of the day but not necessarily unsuccessful by the theatre-going public\u2014after all, Reisinger's original production of \"Swan Lake\" was kept in the active repertoire of the Bolshoi Theatre for seven years and was performed over thirty times during a period when other ballets could not sustain even twenty performances.

A patient's time in the hospital can take 7\u201310 days if no complications present themselves. Depending on the type of surgery the abdominal incision for this surgery may be up to eight inches in length and is typically closed with staples on the outside and several layers of dissolvable stitches on the inside. After surgery, patients will have three drainage tubes place while tissues heal: one through the newly created stoma, one through another temporary opening in the abdominal wall into the pouch, and an SP tube (to drain non-specific post-surgical abdominal fluid). In the hospital, the SP tube and external staples will be removed, after several days. The remaining two tubes will each be connected to collection bags worn on each leg and the patient is usually sent home like this. After sufficient healing, and another doctor's visit, the tube will be removed from the stoma. The patient will now begin to catheterize the pouch every two hours. Since one other tube will still be in place, patients can still sleep through the night, since a larger collection bag is attached to that tube at night time. After approximately one month, patients will return to the hospital for a special x-ray. Dye will be instilled into the pouch to verify that there is no leakage of urine. If there is no leakage, this last tube will be removed. Emptying time now may be increased to 3 hours, however, now the patient will need to wake up during the night (every 3 hours) to empty the pouch. Over time, emptying time can possibly be increased up to 4\u20136 hours.

Hemodynamic monitoring is the measurement of blood circulation and cardiac function that allows clinicians to evaluate whether enough oxygen is being delivered to the organs and tissues. Among these is the Swan-Ganz catheter. Originally developed for patients with acute myocardial infarction, it is now used in anesthesia and critical care units. Healthcare providers use this monitoring to detect changes or problems in a patient\u2019s health, which allows for more informed, immediate treatment decisions.

In the 1940s and 1950s, Canadian surgeon Wilfred Bigelow demonstrated in animal models that the length of time the brain could survive stopped blood circulation could be extended from 3 minutes to 10 minutes by cooling to 30\u00a0\u00b0C before circulation was stopped. He found that this time could be extended to 15 to 24 minutes at temperatures below 20\u00a0\u00b0C. He further found that at a temperature of 5\u00a0\u00b0C, groundhogs could endure two hours of stopped blood circulation without ill effects. This research was motivated by a desire to stop the heart from beating long enough to do surgery on the heart while it remained still. Since heart-lung machines, also known as cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), hadn't been invented yet, stopping the heart meant stopping blood circulation to the whole body, including the brain. The first heart surgery using hypothermia to provide a longer time that blood circulation through the whole body could be safely stopped was performed by F. John Lewis and Mansur Taufic at the University of Minnesota in 1952. In this procedure, the first successful open heart surgery, Lewis repaired an atrial septal defect in a 5-year-old girl during 5 minutes of total circulatory arrest at 28\u00a0\u00b0C. Many similar procedures were performed by Soviet heart surgeon, Eugene Meshalkin, in Novosibirsk during the 1960s.

Many of these became pioneers themselves, particularly in the field of heart surgery. These included F. John Lewis who in 1952, led the team which performed the world's first successful open-heart surgery using hypothermia, C. Walton Lillihei who introduced the technique of cross-circulation for open heart surgery, and Richard A. DeWall who introduced the heart-lung machine. Two of Wangensteen's trainees pioneered the introduction of heart transplantation, Norman Shumway who developed the technique and Christaan Barnard who performed the world's first heart transplant.",

Reperfusion therapy is a medical treatment to restore blood flow, either through or around, blocked arteries, typically after a heart attack (myocardial infarction (MI)). Reperfusion therapy includes drugs and surgery. The drugs are thrombolytics and fibrinolytics used in a process called thrombolysis. Surgeries performed may be minimally-invasive endovascular procedures such as a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), followed by a coronary angioplasty. The angioplasty uses the insertion of a balloon to open up the artery, with the possible additional use of one or more stents. Other surgeries performed are the more invasive bypass surgeries that graft arteries around blockages.",
