So, those who believe in him, and honor him, and help him, and follow the light that has been sent down with him (Muhammad)\u00a0\u2013 they are the ones who acquire success.\" Commenting on this verse, Islamic scholar Muhammad Taqi Usmani says, \"one of the functions of the Holy Prophet (saaw) is \"to make lawful the good things and make unlawful the impure things\". This function has been separated from \"bidding the fair and forbidding the unfair\", because the latter relates to the preaching of what has already been established as fair, and warning against what is established as unfair, while the former embodies the making of lawful and unlawful\". Taqi Usmani recognizes two kinds of revelations\u00a0\u2013 the \"recited\" one which is collectively known as Quran, and the \"unrecited\" one that Muhammad received from time to time to let him know God's will regarding how human affairs should be\u00a0\u2013 and concludes that Muhammad's prophetic authority to promulgate new laws had its base on the later type. Therefore, in Islamic theology, the difference between God's authority and that of his messenger is of great significance: the former is wholly independent, intrinsic and self-existent, while the authority of the latter is derived from and dependent on the revelation from God.",

Other religious holy books like the Bible, the Gita and the Torah are also followed by many people around the world. He realized non-religious people (atheists) also existed in this world. After all he had spent some time among the communists in Russia. The individuals, who inaccurately interpreted the Bible and the Torah, were declared nonbelievers by Islam. In the same way, the person who incorrectly explains the Quran, can be declared an atheist. Islam and the prophet Muhammad taught people to have respect and tolerance for other religions and how to coexist with others on this earth. The Quran clearly states that the Jews and Christians are also 'the people of the book', meaning Almighty God also blessed them with many prophets like Abraham, Moses and Jesus and they all conveyed God's message to the people before prophet Muhammad was born. In Islam, the emphasis is clearly on God being eternal and everything in the universe belonging to Him alone. God alone is the Creator and Protector. It is evident from Ubaidullah Sindhi's travels around the world that he had an international and world outlook. It is also evident from his lifetime behavior and struggles that he wanted India not to be ruled by the British. He wanted India to be ruled by the Indians.",
