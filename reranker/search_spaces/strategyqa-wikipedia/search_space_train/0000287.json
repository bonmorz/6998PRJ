Yoshio Sakamoto, executive officer of Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development division, served as the game's producer, while Takehiko Hosokawa of the same studio was the co-director, along with Jose Luis M\u00e1rquez of MercurySteam. As thirteen years had passed since the last 2D \"Metroid\" game\u20142004's \"\"\u2014was released, Sakamoto had a desire to create a new game in this style. He was also aware of the growing demand from fans for a new 2D \"Metroid\" game. Sakamoto had heard that MercurySteam were interested in taking on the challenge of remaking a \"Metroid\" game, so he visited their studio to organise a collaboration. Although Sakamoto did not work on \"Metroid II\", he believed it to be an important game within the series and so he was enthusiastic about remaking the title. Enric \u00c1lvarez, the head of MercurySteam, described their collaboration with Nintendo as an \"incredible\" achievement for the developer. The development on \"Samus Returns\" began in 2015. Sakamoto noted that the potential for 2D games in the \"Metroid\" franchise had opened up for Nintendo following the announcement of the game. He expressed that he was keen to evolve some of the traditions in 2D \"Metroid\" games. As a remake, he wanted to preserve some of the originality and wanted to avoid changing things without good reason. Their approach was to add to aspects which improved upon the game's core concept. These ideas led to some control enhancements, such as the addition of free aiming for more precise firing. The idea of a melee counterattack came from MercurySteam, who had implemented a similar parry mechanic in their 2013 game, \"\". Sakamoto felt that the inclusion of the melee counterattack offered players an alternative combat style, in contrast to previous games where the player had to rely on dodging charge attacks from enemies and then defeating them from afar. The decision to transition from the 2D pixel art of previous \"Metroid\" titles to 3D polygonal graphics was made so that the development team could incorporate a lot of varied animation and use different angles to enhance the cutscenes. The music was composed by Daisuke Matsuoka and directed by Kenji Yamamoto, with the latter previously co-composing the music for the 1994 Super Nintendo Entertainment System game \"Super Metroid\".",

Yoshio Sakamoto, executive officer of Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development division, served as the game's producer, while Takehiko Hosokawa of the same studio was the co-director, along with Jose Luis M\u00e1rquez of MercurySteam.

He was also aware of the growing demand from fans for a new 2D \"Metroid\" game. Sakamoto had heard that MercurySteam were interested in taking on the challenge of remaking a \"Metroid\" game, so he visited their studio to organise a collaboration. Although Sakamoto did not work on \"Metroid II\", he believed it to be an important game within the series and so he was enthusiastic about remaking the title. Enric \u00c1lvarez, the head of MercurySteam, described their collaboration with Nintendo as an \"incredible\" achievement for the developer. The development on \"Samus Returns\" began in 2015. Sakamoto noted that the potential for 2D games in the \"Metroid\" franchise had opened up for Nintendo following the announcement of the game. He expressed that he was keen to evolve some of the traditions in 2D \"Metroid\" games. As a remake, he wanted to preserve some of the originality and wanted to avoid changing things without good reason. Their approach was to add to aspects which improved upon the game's core concept. These ideas led to some control enhancements, such as the addition of free aiming for more precise firing. The idea of a melee counterattack came from MercurySteam, who had implemented a similar parry mechanic in their 2013 game, \"\". Sakamoto felt that the inclusion of the melee counterattack offered players an alternative combat style, in contrast to previous games where the player had to rely on dodging charge attacks from enemies and then defeating them from afar. The decision to transition from the 2D pixel art of previous \"Metroid\" titles to 3D polygonal graphics was made so that the development team could incorporate a lot of varied animation and use different angles to enhance the cutscenes.

They praised the game's graphics, sound, and controls, while their only negative comment was, \"Even 100 megabits of \"Metroid\" wouldn't be enough.\" \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave \"Super Metroid\" their \"Game of the Month\" award, comparing it favorably to the original \"Metroid\" and applauding the graphics, the many weapons and items available, and the music. Each of the four reviewers gave it scores of nine out of ten. \"GamePro\" criticized that the controls are often awkward or difficult and that many of the power-ups are either lifted from other SNES games or simple upgrades of other power-ups in the game, but praised the game's massive size along with the auto-mapping feature, saying it \"makes a potentially frustrating game accessible to a far wider audience.\" Andy Robinson of GamesRadar was pleased with the game's \"phenomenal\" soundtrack, complimenting it as \"one of the best videogame scores of all time\".",

Computer and Video Games editor Mike Jackson described Ridley as a \"fan favorite.\" GameDaily called him the 16th greatest Nintendo character, commenting that he \"beats Mother Brain by a mile as the coolest Metroid villain.\" IGN editor Jesse Schedeen called Ridley the real villain of the \"Metroid\" series, commenting that he would have to be included in a \"Metroid\" film if one were made due to him being too important to leave out. 1UP.com editor Nadia Oxford described the Nintendo Comics System version of Ridley as being more of a \"squashed bug\" than a \"fearsome reptile.\" The 1UP.com staff listed the battle with Ridley in \"Super Metroid\" as among the most iconic in Nintendo history. They stated that his appearance in \"Super Metroid\" is more memorable than any other appearance in the \"Metroid\" series, and that his return from the original game added some familiarity to \"Metroid\" fans. GamesRadar listed him third on their list of video game villains who will never stay dead, calling him Samus's \"great white whale\" that, even while he has tormented her throughout her life, she just cannot seem to kill. Gaming Nexus criticized the lack of fellow \"Metroid\" villain Kraid in \"\", but stated that the developers made up for it by adding the best Ridley battle in the series's history. IGN editors Phil Pirrello and Richard George listed Ridley as the second most deserving Nintendo character for inclusion in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", stating that Samus was the only playable character in the game to represent the \"Metroid\" series (despite it being one of Nintendo's most famous and revered), and that the inclusion of Ridley would broaden the series's range.",

The team for \"Hunters\" was composed of thirty people, which Abe noted was larger than the development team of most other Nintendo DS games. Kensuke Tanabe of Nintendo came up with the original idea for the game. Retro Studios, which developed previous \"Metroid Prime\" games, was unable to develop \"Metroid Prime Hunters\" because it was already working on a game. Therefore, Tanabe contacted NST with the idea, and let them develop it instead. NST developed the game instead of Nintendo themselves because Nintendo wanted the division to influence \"Metroid Prime Hunters\" with western ideals, styles, and presentation.",

They worked on the game's framerate to make the graphics move more smoothly. The game's visuals were improved; a developer added reflections to the Morph Ball.

Foxhoven stated that these questions came up: \"What are they doing when they are NOT fighting? What is their daily existence and relationships? What are Samus's aspirations, history, and fears?\" and further stated that \"Nintendo appreciated the questions, but had never thought about them before, and ultimately didn't have a lot of answers\" and at the end, Nintendo \"felt uncomfortable with our team [Hollywood] being the ones to propose those answers\" which basically caused the \"Metroid\" movie project to be ultimately canceled sometime in 2007.
