As thirteen years had passed since the last 2D \"Metroid\" game\u20142004's \"\"\u2014was released, Sakamoto had a desire to create a new game in this style. He was also aware of the growing demand from fans for a new 2D \"Metroid\" game. Sakamoto had heard that MercurySteam were interested in taking on the challenge of remaking a \"Metroid\" game, so he visited their studio to organise a collaboration. Although Sakamoto did not work on \"Metroid II\", he believed it to be an important game within the series and so he was enthusiastic about remaking the title. Enric \u00c1lvarez, the head of MercurySteam, described their collaboration with Nintendo as an \"incredible\" achievement for the developer. The development on \"Samus Returns\" began in 2015. Sakamoto noted that the potential for 2D games in the \"Metroid\" franchise had opened up for Nintendo following the announcement of the game. He expressed that he was keen to evolve some of the traditions in 2D \"Metroid\" games. As a remake, he wanted to preserve some of the originality and wanted to avoid changing things without good reason. Their approach was to add to aspects which improved upon the game's core concept. These ideas led to some control enhancements, such as the addition of free aiming for more precise firing. The idea of a melee counterattack came from MercurySteam, who had implemented a similar parry mechanic in their 2013 game, \"\". Sakamoto felt that the inclusion of the melee counterattack offered players an alternative combat style, in contrast to previous games where the player had to rely on dodging charge attacks from enemies and then defeating them from afar. The decision to transition from the 2D pixel art of previous \"Metroid\" titles to 3D polygonal graphics was made so that the development team could incorporate a lot of varied animation and use different angles to enhance the cutscenes. The music was composed by Daisuke Matsuoka and directed by Kenji Yamamoto, with the latter previously co-composing the music for the 1994 Super Nintendo Entertainment System game \"Super Metroid\".",

At the E3 convention the following year, IGN awarded the game, titled \"Metroid Fusion\", their Best of Show and Best Action Game awards.",

            "document": "Metroid: Samus Returns . \"Metroid: Samus Returns\" was developed collaboratively by the Spanish video game development studio MercurySteam and the Japanese company Nintendo. Yoshio Sakamoto, executive officer of Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development division, served as the game's producer, while Takehiko Hosokawa of the same studio was the co-director, along with Jose Luis M\u00e1rquez of MercurySteam. As thirteen years had passed since the last 2D \"Metroid\" game\u20142004's \"\"\u2014was released, Sakamoto had a desire to create a new game in this style. He was also aware of the growing demand from fans for a new 2D \"Metroid\" game. Sakamoto had heard that MercurySteam were interested in taking on the challenge of remaking a \"Metroid\" game, so he visited their studio to organise a collaboration. Although Sakamoto did not work on \"Metroid II\", he believed it to be an important game within the series and so he was enthusiastic about remaking the title. Enric \u00c1lvarez, the head of MercurySteam, described their collaboration with Nintendo as an \"incredible\" achievement for the developer. The development on \"Samus Returns\" began in 2015. Sakamoto noted that the potential for 2D games in the \"Metroid\" franchise had opened up for Nintendo following the announcement of the game. He expressed that he was keen to evolve some of the traditions in 2D \"Metroid\" games. As a remake, he wanted to preserve some of the originality and wanted to avoid changing things without good reason. Their approach was to add to aspects which improved upon the game's core concept. These ideas led to some control enhancements, such as the addition of free aiming for more precise firing. The idea of a melee counterattack came from MercurySteam, who had implemented a similar parry mechanic in their 2013 game, \"\". Sakamoto felt that the inclusion of the melee counterattack offered players an alternative combat style, in contrast to previous games where the player had to rely on dodging charge attacks from enemies and then defeating them from afar. The decision to transition from the 2D pixel art of previous \"Metroid\" titles to 3D polygonal graphics was made so that the development team could incorporate a lot of varied animation and use different angles to enhance the cutscenes. The music was composed by Daisuke Matsuoka and directed by Kenji Yamamoto, with the latter previously co-composing the music for the 1994 Super Nintendo Entertainment System game \"Super Metroid\".",

In a retrospective focusing on the entire \"Metroid\" series, GameTrailers remarked on the original game's legacy and its effect on the video game industry. They noted that starting with \"Metroid\", search and discovery is what continues to make the franchise popular. The website felt that the combination of detailed sprites, original map designs, and an intimidating musical score \"generated an unparalleled ambience and atmosphere that trapped the viewer in an almost claustrophobic state\". They also noted that the Morph Ball, first introduced in \"Metroid\", \"slammed an undeniable stamp of coolness on the whole experience and the franchise\", and they enjoyed the end segment after defeating Mother Brain, claiming that the race to escape the planet Zebes was a \"twist few saw coming\". The game brought \"explosive action\" to the Nintendo Entertainment System and a newfound respect for female protagonists. Noting that \"Metroid\" was not the first game to offer an open world, nor was it the first side-view platformer exploration game, and neither was it the first game to allow players to reach new areas using newly acquired items, Gamasutra praised \"Metroid\" for being perhaps the first video game to \"take these different elements and rigorously mold them into a game-ruling structure\".",

Sam Machkovech at \"Ars Technica\" said that the game would be a delight to people who liked \"Zero Mission\", and that its quality and amount of polish put it on par with Nintendo's games. Zack Furniss of \"Destructoid\" liked the game to the point that he thought Nintendo should use some ideas from it in future \"Metroid\" titles. Jonathan Holmes, also at \"Destructoid\", said that \"AM2R\" does a good job at filling the \"void\" left by Nintendo's lack of new 2D \"Metroid\" games, calling it \"even more of an extensive re-imagining than \"Metroid: Zero Mission\" was to \"Metroid 1\"\". Gon\u00e7alo Lopes at \"Nintendo Life\" said that the game was a great way to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary and a dream come true for \"Metroid\" fans, and that he imagined people would be willing to pay money for it if sold on Nintendo's eShop. Matthew Castle at \"Nintendo Gamer\" called it an example of how to do a remake right. Tom Sykes at \"PC Gamer\" praised \"AM2R\" as a \"great game in its own right\" regardless of whether one had played \"Metroid II\" prior or not. \"NF Magazine\" Tony Ponce initially worried that the game would lose the \"eerie charm\" of \"Metroid II\", but found it to be able to keep a high-tension feeling, as well as including new things for longtime fans of the original.",

Samus' ship is from the original \"Metroid Prime\", and her suit is the same one that appears in \"Metroid Prime 2: Echoes\". The developers decided to add them because they wanted to show that the technology has evolved, and they also wanted to include something that was instantly recognizable to those who had played previous games in the series. On level design, Abe said that as the game's controls shifted from an analog stick method to touchscreen aiming, the developers wanted to avoid making the gameplay and the control scheme more difficult.",
