It is quite common for broad Black Country speakers to say \"'agooin'\" where others say \"going.\" This is found in the greeting \"Ow b'ist gooin\" (How are you), to which a typical response would be \"Bostin ah kid\" (very well).

Currently, it is classified as a critically endangered species and has been so since 2000 by the IUCN on its IUCN Red List of endangered species. Awareness of the conservation status of \"Bubalus mindorensis\" began in 1965 when it was classified as \"Status inadequately known\" by the IUCN. Enough data was gathered on the tamaraw population by 1986, and the IUCN conservation monitoring center declared the species endangered. Throughout succeeding surveys conducted in 1988, 1990, 1994 and 1996, the species remained listed on the Red List as \"endangered\". The relisting of the species in 1996 fulfilled the IUCN criteria \"B1+2c\" and \"D1\". Criterion \"B1\" indicated that the species' range was less than 500 square kilometers and is known to exist in less than five independent locations. A noticed continuing decline in the population fulfilled sub-criterion \"2c\", given the condition of the population's sole habitat. Criterion \"D1\" essentially required that a population be composed of less than 250 mature individuals; individual counts of the \"B. mindorensis\" population at the time figured significantly lower than this. In 2000, the tamaraw was relisted on the Red List under the more severe \"C1\" criteria. This was due to estimates that the population would decline by 20% in five years or within the timespan of two generations.",

Further details about the animal's biology were revealed in the 19th century by several English scientists. Because of its distinctive appearance, the koala is recognised worldwide as a symbol of Australia. Koalas are listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The Australian government similarly lists specific populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable. The animal was hunted heavily in the early 20th century for its fur, and large-scale cullings in Queensland resulted in a public outcry that initiated a movement to protect the species. Sanctuaries were established, and translocation efforts moved to new regions koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced.

            "document": "Koala . Koalas were hunted for food by Aboriginals. A common technique used to capture the animals was to attach a loop of ropey bark to the end of a long, thin pole, so as to form a noose. This would be used to snare an animal high in a tree, beyond the reach of a climbing hunter; an animal brought down this way would then be killed with a stone hand axe or hunting stick (waddy). According to the customs of some tribes, it was considered taboo to skin the animal, while other tribes thought the animal's head had a special status, and saved them for burial. The koala was heavily hunted by European settlers in the early 20th century, largely for its thick, soft fur. More than two million pelts are estimated to have left Australia by 1924. Pelts were in demand for use in rugs, coat linings, muffs, and as trimming on women's garments. Extensive cullings occurred in Queensland in 1915, 1917, and again in 1919, when over one million koalas were killed with guns, poisons, and nooses. The public outcry over these cullings was probably the first wide-scale environmental issue that rallied Australians. Novelist and social critic Vance Palmer, writing in a letter to \"The Courier-Mail\", expressed the popular sentiment: \"The shooting of our harmless and lovable native bear is nothing less than barbarous\u00a0... No one has ever accused him of spoiling the farmer's wheat, eating the squatter's grass, or even the spreading of the prickly pear. There is no social vice that can be put down to his account\u00a0... He affords no sport to the gun-man\u00a0... And he has been almost blotted out already from some areas.\" Despite the growing movement to protect native species, the poverty brought about by the drought of 1926\u201328 led to the killing of another 600,000 koalas during a one-month open season in August 1927. In 1934, Frederick Lewis, the Chief Inspector of Game in Victoria, said that the once-abundant animal had been brought to near extinction in that state, suggesting that only 500\u20131000 remained. The first successful efforts at conserving the species were initiated by the establishment of Brisbane's Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary and Sydney's Koala Park Sanctuary in the 1920s and 1930s. The owner of the latter park, Noel Burnet, became the first to successfully breed koalas and earned a reputation as the foremost contemporary authority on the marsupial. In 1934, David Fleay, curator of Australian mammals at the Melbourne Zoo, established the first Australian faunal enclosure at an Australian zoo, and featured the koala. This arrangement allowed him to undertake a detailed study of its diet in captivity. Fleay later continued his conservation efforts at Healesville Sanctuary and the David Fleay Wildlife Park.",

Their numbers have significantly increased, and since the islands are not large enough to sustain such high koala numbers, overbrowsing has become a problem. In the 1920s, Lewis initiated a program of large-scale relocation and rehabilitation programs to transfer koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced to new regions, with the intent of eventually returning them to their former range. For example, in 1930\u201331, 165 koalas were translocated to Quail Island. After a period of population growth, and subsequent overbrowsing of gum trees on the island, about 1,300 animals were released into mainland areas in 1944. The practice of translocating koalas became commonplace; Victorian State manager Peter Menkorst estimated that from 1923 to 2006, about 25,000 animals were translocated to more than 250 release sites across Victoria. Since the 1990s, government agencies have tried to control their numbers by culling, but public and international outcry has forced the use of translocation and sterilisation, instead. One of the biggest anthropogenic threats to the koala is habitat destruction and fragmentation. In coastal areas, the main cause of this is urbanisation, while in rural areas, habitat is cleared for agriculture. Native forest trees are also taken down to be made into wood products. In 2000, Australia ranked fifth in the world by deforestation rates, having cleared . The distribution of the koala has shrunk by more than 50% since European arrival, largely due to fragmentation of habitat in Queensland. The koala's \"vulnerable\" status in Queensland and New South Wales means that developers in these states must consider the impacts on this species when making building applications.

As of 2013, however, there were indications that mining would soon begin at the only sites where this species exists, posing an imminent threat to its existence. Its range is also subject to habitat destruction via deforestation. In this region, bats are also used as a food source, so this bat is likely killed for bushmeat. At least some of its range is encompassed by Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve, which confers some protections, though these protections may not be strictly enforced. Due to its imperiled status, it is identified by the Alliance for Zero Extinction as a species in danger of imminent extinction.  In 2013, Bat Conservation International listed this species as one of the 35 species of its worldwide priority list of conservation. The Lamotte's roundleaf bat was specifically named in an article that argued against collecting zoological specimens from critically endangered bat species, or at least promoted more restrictions on who could collect specimens and how many individuals they could collect.",

Due to their large territories and low productivity, most booted eagle species are sparsely distributed and not infrequently uncommon-to-rare even in regional strongholds where ample habitat remains. Booted eagle species tend to be highly sensitive to human activities, mainly habitat alteration or destruction, human disturbance, accidental or intentional killing of staple prey species and various forms of persecution by humans. Due mainly to these factors, five species of booted eagle are classified as Vulnerable to extinction by the IUCN. Three little-known forest dwelling species are classified in more severe status as Endangered: the Philippine hawk-eagle (\"Nisaetus philippensis\"), Pinsker's hawk-eagle (\"Nisaetus pinskeri\") and the black-and-chestnut eagle (\"Spizaetus isidori\"). An even more drastic classification of Critically Endangered was given to the Flores hawk-eagle (\"N. floris\"). In all four endangered hawk-eagles, near epidemic levels of habitat degradation to the forests has been determined as the primary cause of their declines.",

This is because the species occurs in less than 5000\u00a0km\u00b2, and its range, available habitat, and population size are shrinking (BirdLife International 2004). Despite the rediscovery of the northern population, no more than a handful of individuals are known to remain, and further research to locate additional subpopulations is urgently needed. In any case, the species will probably be uplisted to Critically Endangered soon; of the 4 subpopulations known, only one (near La Cima) seems reasonably numerous.",
