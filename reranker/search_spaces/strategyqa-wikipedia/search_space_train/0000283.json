Yoshio Sakamoto, executive officer of Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development division, served as the game's producer, while Takehiko Hosokawa of the same studio was the co-director, along with Jose Luis M\u00e1rquez of MercurySteam. As thirteen years had passed since the last 2D \"Metroid\" game\u20142004's \"\"\u2014was released, Sakamoto had a desire to create a new game in this style. He was also aware of the growing demand from fans for a new 2D \"Metroid\" game. Sakamoto had heard that MercurySteam were interested in taking on the challenge of remaking a \"Metroid\" game, so he visited their studio to organise a collaboration. Although Sakamoto did not work on \"Metroid II\", he believed it to be an important game within the series and so he was enthusiastic about remaking the title. Enric \u00c1lvarez, the head of MercurySteam, described their collaboration with Nintendo as an \"incredible\" achievement for the developer. The development on \"Samus Returns\" began in 2015. Sakamoto noted that the potential for 2D games in the \"Metroid\" franchise had opened up for Nintendo following the announcement of the game. He expressed that he was keen to evolve some of the traditions in 2D \"Metroid\" games. As a remake, he wanted to preserve some of the originality and wanted to avoid changing things without good reason. Their approach was to add to aspects which improved upon the game's core concept. These ideas led to some control enhancements, such as the addition of free aiming for more precise firing. The idea of a melee counterattack came from MercurySteam, who had implemented a similar parry mechanic in their 2013 game, \"\". Sakamoto felt that the inclusion of the melee counterattack offered players an alternative combat style, in contrast to previous games where the player had to rely on dodging charge attacks from enemies and then defeating them from afar. The decision to transition from the 2D pixel art of previous \"Metroid\" titles to 3D polygonal graphics was made so that the development team could incorporate a lot of varied animation and use different angles to enhance the cutscenes. The music was composed by Daisuke Matsuoka and directed by Kenji Yamamoto, with the latter previously co-composing the music for the 1994 Super Nintendo Entertainment System game \"Super Metroid\".",

Starbreeze then partnered with Electronic Arts for two different games, one was known as \"Project Redlime\", while the other was an action-adventure video game set within the \"Bourne\" universe. The \"Bourne\" game was cancelled as a direct result of Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass not participating in the fourth \"Bourne\" film. \"Project Redlime\" had a larger scale than the \"Bourne\" game. It was said to be a reinvention of one of Electronic Arts' franchises. The company shifted from a technology-orientated company to focus more on the core gameplay mechanics of their new project. \"Syndicate\" was announced in September 2011. The game suffered from a troubled development, with Starbreeze completely reworking the game one year after its initial development. There were also many creative differences between the developer and the publisher, and the two companies suffered from an inharmonious relationship. During the game's development, seven senior members of the company, including H\u00f6gdahl, left to form their own smaller studio. Some of them formed MachineGames to work on their own original games. With a budget that was less than other typical AAA video games, \"Syndicate\" received average reviews and was a commercial failure. Grefberg left the company after the game's completion, and 25 employees were laid off.",

Yoshio Sakamoto, executive officer of Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development division, served as the game's producer, while Takehiko Hosokawa of the same studio was the co-director, along with Jose Luis M\u00e1rquez of MercurySteam. As thirteen years had passed since the last 2D \"Metroid\" game\u20142004's \"\"\u2014was released, Sakamoto had a desire to create a new game in this style. He was also aware of the growing demand from fans for a new 2D \"Metroid\" game. Sakamoto had heard that MercurySteam were interested in taking on the challenge of remaking a \"Metroid\" game, so he visited their studio to organise a collaboration. Although Sakamoto did not work on \"Metroid II\", he believed it to be an important game within the series and so he was enthusiastic about remaking the title. Enric \u00c1lvarez, the head of MercurySteam, described their collaboration with Nintendo as an \"incredible\" achievement for the developer. The development on \"Samus Returns\" began in 2015. Sakamoto noted that the potential for 2D games in the \"Metroid\" franchise had opened up for Nintendo following the announcement of the game. He expressed that he was keen to evolve some of the traditions in 2D \"Metroid\" games. As a remake, he wanted to preserve some of the originality and wanted to avoid changing things without good reason. Their approach was to add to aspects which improved upon the game's core concept. These ideas led to some control enhancements, such as the addition of free aiming for more precise firing. The idea of a melee counterattack came from MercurySteam, who had implemented a similar parry mechanic in their 2013 game, \"\". Sakamoto felt that the inclusion of the melee counterattack offered players an alternative combat style, in contrast to previous games where the player had to rely on dodging charge attacks from enemies and then defeating them from afar. The decision to transition from the 2D pixel art of previous \"Metroid\" titles to 3D polygonal graphics was made so that the development team could incorporate a lot of varied animation and use different angles to enhance the cutscenes. The music was composed by Daisuke Matsuoka and directed by Kenji Yamamoto, with the latter previously co-composing the music for the 1994 Super Nintendo Entertainment System game \"Super Metroid\".",
