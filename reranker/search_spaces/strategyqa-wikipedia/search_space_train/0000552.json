Indeed, the original haiku included the theme \"oni\" (the \"it\" in Japanese is a demon, though in some parts a very young child forced to play \"it\" was called a \"sea slug\" (namako)). To him, seeing a game of hide-and-seek, or recalling it as it grew cold would be a chilling experience. Terayama might also have recalled opening his eyes and finding himself all alone, feeling the cold more intensely than he did a minute before among other children. Either way, any genuinely personal experience would be haiku and not senry\u016b in the classic sense. If you think Terayama's poem uses a child's game to express in hyperbolic metaphor how, in retrospect, life is short, and nothing more, then this would indeed work as a senry\u016b. Otherwise, it is a bona-fide haiku. There is also the possibility that it is a joke about playing hide and seek, only to realize (winter having arrived during the months spent hiding) that no one wants to find you.",

The Japanese-American scholar and translator Kenneth Yasuda published \"The Japanese Haiku: Its Essential Nature, History, and Possibilities in English, with Selected Examples\" in 1957. The book includes both translations from Japanese and original poems of his own in English, which had previously appeared in his book titled \"A Pepper-Pod: Classic Japanese Poems together with Original Haiku\". In these books Yasuda presented a critical theory about haiku, to which he added comments on haiku poetry by early 20th-century poets and critics. His translations apply a 5\u20137\u20135 syllable count in English, with the first and third lines end-rhymed. Yasuda considered that haiku translated into English should utilize all of the poetic resources of the language. Yasuda's theory also includes the concept of a \"haiku moment\" based in personal experience, and provides the motive for writing a haiku (' an aesthestic moment' of a timeless feeling of enlightened harmony as the poet's nature and the environment are unified'). This notion of the haiku moment has resonated with haiku writers in English, even though the notion is not widely promoted in Japanese haiku.(See however, 'Shiki's Haiku Moments for Us Today'",
