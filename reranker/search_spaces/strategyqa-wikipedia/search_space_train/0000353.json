After Matilda was widowed in 1125, she returned to her father in England, who then secured her marriage to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou.

The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France.

He notices first that \u2018man is a biological being with a physical body\u2019, which is the \u2018less than God\u2019, as we think of \u2018God as a being of pure spirit, lifted above the categories of time and space\u2019. The psalmist would then say that God made man that way, and because of this \u2018there is nothing wrong with it\u2019 and that \u2018everything God makes is good; therefore there is nothing wrong with it\u2019. The Greeks, as King informs us, \u2018felt the body was evil\u2019 and that the \u2018soul could never reach its full maturity until it broke loose from the prison of the body\u2019. However, Christianity raises the view that \u2018the body is not the principle of evil; it says the will is the principle of evil\u2019. He then defines that in \u2018any doctrine of man, we must be concerned with man's physical well being\u2019. To support this he brings up Jesus` quote that we need the \u201cbread\u201d to survive and also states \u2018this isn\u2019t the only part\u2019 and if we stop here we would see \u2018man merely as an animal\u2019. He then brings an example of chemists who calculated that the values of man came to \u2018about ninety-eight cents\u2019, today with our living standards it comes to \u2018a dollar ninety eight for the average man\u2019. King challenges this idea by questioning \u2018But can we explain the whole of man in terms of ninety eight cents?\u2019 and brings up examples of human genius; and again asks \u2018Can we explain the mystery of the human soul in terms of ninety eight cents?\u2019 To this he answers \u201cno\u201d and states that \u2018man is a child of God\u2019 and raises the second basic point of the doctrine \u2018that man is a being of spirit\u2019, which is the \u2018thou has crowned him with glory and honour\u2019, and because of our \u2018rational capacity, man has a mind, man can reason. This distinguishes us from the lower animals\u2019. King then defines man as \u2018God\u2019s marvellous creation. Through his mind he can leap oceans, break through walls, and transcend the categories of time and space\u2019. With this he defines what the biblical writers meant when they said \u2018man is made in the image of God\u2019, and that he has \u2018rational capacity; he has the unique ability to have a fellowship with God.

The Spekkens toy model is based on the knowledge balance principle: \"the number of questions about the physical state of a system that are answered must always be equal to the number that are unanswered in a state of maximal knowledge.\" However, the \"knowledge\" one can possess about a system must be carefully defined for this principle to have any meaning. To do this, the concept of a \"canonical\" set of yes or no questions is defined as the minimum number of questions needed. For example, for a system with 4 states, one can ask \"Is the system in state 1?\", \"Is the system in state 2?\" and \"Is the system in state 3?\" which would determine the state of the system (state 4 being the case if all three questions were answered \"No.\"). However, one could also ask \"Is the system in either state 1 or state 2?\" and \"Is the system in either state 1 or state 3?\", which would also uniquely determine the state, and has only two questions in the set. This set of questions is not unique, however it is clear that at least two questions (bits) are required to exactly represent one of four states. We say that for a system with 4 states, the number of questions in a canonical set is two. As such, in this case, the knowledge balance principle insists that the maximum number of questions in a canonical set that one can have answered at any given time is one, such that the amount of knowledge is equal to the amount of ignorance.",

Given this multiplicity of tags to documents, a question remains: how effective are the tags at isolating any single document? Naively, if we specify a single tag in this system we would uniquely identify lots of documents \u2013 thus the answer to our question is \"not very well!\". However this method carries a faulty assumption; not every document is equal. Some documents are more popular and important than others, and this importance is conveyed by the number bookmarks per document. Thus, we can reformulate the above question to be: how well does the mapping of tags to documents retain about the distribution of the documents? Information theory provides a natural framework to understand the amount of shared information between two random variables. The conditional entropy measures the amount of entropy remaining in one random variable when we know the value of a second random variable. Work done by Chi and Mytkowicz show that the entropy of documents conditional on tags, H(D|T), is increasing rapidly. What this means is that, even after knowing completely the value of a tag, the entropy of the set of documents is increasing over time. Conditional Entropy asks the question: \"Given that I know a set of tags, how much uncertainty regarding the document set that I was referencing with those tags remains?\" The fact that this curve is strictly increasing suggests that the specificity of any given tag is decreasing. That is to say, as a navigation aid, tags are becoming harder and harder to use. We are moving closer and closer to the proverbial \"needle in a haystack\" where any single tag references too many documents to be considered useful.",

Just what this experience was that might make his fellow believers question if he were a fit and proper person to exhort them to righteousness, he naturally doesn't say.

Plato answered his own question by stating that knowledge is present at birth and all information learned by a person is merely a recollection of something the soul has already learned previously, which is called the Theory of Recollection or Platonic epistemology. This answer could be further justified by a paradox: If a person knows something, they don't need to question it, and if a person does not know something, they don't know to question it.

You're into the spiritual domain when you ask ultimate questions\u2014'what's the ultimate meaning of life?', when you deal with totalities\u2014'What is the entire world like? What is my whole life like? How should I live my whole life?' And 'boundary conditions' is a little harder to explain, but think in terms of, \"When have I reached the limit?\" For example, if I tell you that I know something, you may ask me how I know and I may be able to give you an answer. Then when I give you the answer, that has to be something else that I know, and so you may ask me about it, and I may give you an answer. But ultimately, we reach some kind of end because I can't give you answers forever. All knowledge has that structure, that you can back up some knowledge with other knowledge, and you can back that up with some other, but there is never an infinite sequence of backing up. You do reach an end point. The fact that you reach an end point is an example of a boundary condition with respect to knowledge, that knowledge is not founded on an infinite set of foundations, nor is it founded on a secure foundation. A secure foundation is just some other fact that one can ask questions about. So knowledge starts somewhere, and it doesn't start from further knowledge, ultimately. And it's in dealing with such questions as, 'Where does our knowledge come from? What is its foundations? What kind of confidence can we have in it?'\u00a0\u2013 these kinds of questions, I think are what you're dealing with when you think of a religion.\"",

Some teachers may find these questions annoying or difficult to answer, and indeed may have been trained to respond to such questions with hostility and contempt, designed to instill fear. Better teachers respond eagerly to these questions, and use them to help the students deepen their understand by examining alternative methods so the students can choose for themselves which method they prefer. This process can result in meaningful class discussions. Talking is the way in which students increase their understanding and command of math. Teachers can emphasize the importance of original thinking rather than rote manipulation of formulas. This can be done through class conversations.
