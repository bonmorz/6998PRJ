In the earlier series there was the ongoing Temporal Cold War plot, with the Xindi attack at the end of the second season resulting in a season long story arc during season three.

The first of these arcs was a resolution to the long running Temporal Cold War, with Braga stating that the intention was \"to resolve [it]... once and for all\". This would also mark the final appearance of the Suliban in \"Enterprise\" as they were tied into that storyline. However, the episodes wrapping up the cold war did not reveal the identity of \"future guy\", the person from the future who was advising the Suliban. Braga explained in a pre-season interview that \"Well, we've been debating that for quite some time, and I'll leave that question open. We haven't decided yet. We have some ideas about him \u2014 or her \u2014 or it. But we haven't settled on any one identity yet.

Lucasfilm, for the most part, has allowed but not endorsed the creation of these derivative fan fiction works, so long as no such work attempts to make a profit from or tarnish the \"Star Wars\" franchise in any way. While many fan films have used elements from the licensed Expanded Universe to tell their story, they are not considered an official part of the \"Star Wars canon\".",

This is a list of \"Star Wars\" species, containing the names of fictional sentient species from the \"Star Wars\" franchise beginning with the letters P through T. \"Star Wars\" is an American epic space opera film series created by George Lucas. The first film in the series, \"Star Wars\", was released on May 25, 1977 and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon, followed by four sequels and three prequels. Many species of alien creatures (often humanoid) are depicted. In Galactic Basic, the Paaerduag is an \"individual\" formed by two symbiotic races that are joined as one. However, two voices create the actual name of their race, and four ears hear the true sound of it. The larger, more mobile, aspect of the Paaerduag looks like a humanoid, with long, slender arms and legs, and a head about as broad as its body, however, its voice is unheard by human ears. The smaller aspect of the Paaerduag rides upon the larger in a backpack, of sorts, facing to the rear, and looks remotely like a humanoid with a slender, almost dog-like face, and two sets of eyes. It is capable of being heard and understood. Instead of referring to itself as \"I\" or \"me\", it uses the term \"we\", instead.",

You make Heath Shuler look like an All-Star.\" Leaf, accompanied by a coach and security guards, walked towards the fan and asked a question. The fan began walking closer to Leaf, and two coaches restrained Leaf, with another Chargers employee saying \"No, don't do it, Ryan. Don't do it.\" Leaf later explained the incident: \"...what I wanted to do was say, 'Hey, look, I've grown up, I'm calm about it, I would like to understand why you would say that about me.'\"",

A more recent and advanced development in 2017 involved students at Macquarie University in Australia developed a method of multiplying laser power by the use of diamonds. This concept is similar to the fictional kyber crystals used in the \"Star Wars\" universe to power up laser weapons from smaller scale weapons (e.g. blasters, lightsabers) to super-scale intensity in the case of the Death Star. The Death Star's laser power works in a similar method to this by concentrating multiple light beams into one spot from where they combine into a single beam. This beam has been described as more powerful than usual because it can be used for the purpose of destroying/damaging solid objects such as drones and debris that it was compared to the lasers used by the Death Star.",
