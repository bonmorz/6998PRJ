The subsonic Boeing B-47 Stratojet and Boeing B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers were followed by the Mach\u00a02 Convair B-58 Hustler, with the Mach\u00a03 North American B-70 Valkyrie on the drawing board at that time. A major upgrade in the PVO defence system was required, and at the start of 1958 a requirement was issued for manned interceptors capable of reaching 3,000\u00a0km/h (1,864\u00a0mph) and heights of up to 27\u00a0km (88,583\u00a0ft). Mikoyan and Sukhoi responded. The Mikoyan-Gurevich OKB had been working on a series of interceptors during the second half of the 1950s: the I-1, I-3U, I-7U, I-75, Ye-150, Ye-150A, Ye-152, Ye-152A, Ye-152P, and Ye-152M. The Ye-150 was noteworthy because it was built specifically to test the Tumansky R-15 engine, two of which would later be used for the MiG-25. This led to Ye-152, alternatively known as Ye-166, which set several world records. The Ye-152M (converted from one of the two Ye-152 aircraft) was intended to be the definite heavy interceptor design. But before it was finished, the PVO had selected the Tupolev Tu-128. As the work on the MiG-25 was well under way, the single-engine Ye-152M was abandoned.",

In 1973, Breslin et al. tested the effects of alcoholic beverage consumption on the respiratory symptoms of 11 asthmatic subjects who gave a history of asthma attacks following certain alcoholic beverages. In response to ingesting the type of beverage that the subjects reported to provoke their symptoms, six developed the asthmatic symptom of chest tightness, two developed a symptom often associated with asthma, rhinitis, and one subject developed both chest tightness and rhinitis. Symptoms developed almost immediately after ingestion, inhalation of fumes from the beverages did not precipitate symptoms, and bronchoconstriction in response to the ingestion was confirmed in the three patients evaluated by pulmonary function tests. The study suggested that these reactions were induced by non-alcoholic allergens that were contained in or contaminated the beverages. In 1978 a non-asthmatic female of Japanese descent with a history of moderately severe bronchoconstriction responses to various alcoholic beverages and in 1981 an asthmatic Japanese male with a similar history beer or 95% pure ethanol were studied and found to develop bronchoconstriction after drinking apple juice but not after drinking apple juice per se; intravenous infusion or inhalation of ethanol also caused bronchospasm responses in the male subject. These studies suggested that alcohol itself caused the asthmatic symptoms triggered by alcoholic beverages. A subsequent study in 1986 found that 9 of 18 patients with a history of red wine-induced asthma symptoms showed bronchoconstriction in response to ingesting red wine; the response correlated positively with the amount of sulfur dioxide contained in the provocative wine. The study suggested that the reaction was not allergen-induced but rather triggered by sulfur dioxide, a sulfur dioxide-related agent, or an agent whose levels in alcohol beverages correlated positively with those of sulfur dioxide. Finally, a questionnaire survey of 366 asthmatic patients conducted in 2000 found that 33% reported asthma symptoms in response to alcoholic beverages; there was a significant association between wine-induced asthma and asthma triggered by sulfite-containing foods, by aspirin, and by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) other than aspirin. The study suggested the salicylate-\"contaminates\" in wine may contribute to these responses. In other studies, D.P. Agarwal and colleagues associated race-based variations in the activity alcohol-metabolizing enzymes with the occurrence of alcohol flush reactions to alcohol and alcoholic beverages in certain Asian populations. This early work is the basis for further studies that have defined not only many alcohol-induced flush reactions but also many alcohol-induced respiratory reactions as due to racially associated genetic differences in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes.",
