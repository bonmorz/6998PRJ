This is because hegemony is possible only through antagonism; and antagonism, in turn, can exist only through lack or surplus: consensus, in this view, is never a complete closure; rather, it only ever exists as the \u2018temporary result of a provisional hegemony\u2019.

The warmness and dampness of the ground is causing the fog to come closer to the surface level of the ocean. As the rain falls it makes the ground wet, then the warm air rises leaving a layer of cold air that turns into fog causing an unsafe ocean for travel and for working conditions on the ocean. It is also causing the ocean to create more floods due to the fact that it is warming up and the glaciers from the ice age are now melting causing the sea levels to rise, which causes the ocean to take over part of the land and beaches. Glaciers are melting at an alarming rate which is causing the ocean to rise faster than predicted.

During this process, the leading social group exerts its impact and gain its legitimacy mainly through social mechanisms such as education, religion, family and the mass media. Based on the definition of hegemony, media hegemony means the dominance of a certain aspects of life and thoughts by penetrating dominant culture and values in social life. In other words, media hegemony served as a crucial shaper of culture, values and ideology of society (Altheide, 1984).  For example, TV news departments are considered as extensions of a capitalistic economic order (Hall, 1979). The products of the media contain messages that convey the nature of society, the nature of relation of production within the media and the domain of institutions and social process (Golding, 1979).

In the early 20th century, in the field of international relations, the Italian Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci developed the theory of cultural domination (an analysis of economic class) to include social class; hence, the philosophic and sociologic theory of cultural hegemony analysed the social norms that established the social structures (social and economic classes) with which the ruling class establish and exert cultural dominance to impose their \"Weltanschauung\" (world view)\u2014justifying the social, political, and economic \"status quo\"\u2014as natural, inevitable, and beneficial to every social class, rather than as artificial social constructs beneficial solely to the ruling class.",

            "document": "Carbon diet . Global carbon dioxide concentrations are beginning to rise on an annual basis. According to senior NASA scientist Roy Spencer, the reality of global warming should not be disputed and that we should instead turn our attention towards the growth per year. The past decade has produced nine of the eleven hottest years recorded this century. The resulting buildup of carbon in areas such as the atmosphere, oceans, and soil contain a major threat to life. The threat of global warming has been an issue we have discovered due to high concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere but have not addressed as a global community. Not only is climate change an environmental issue, it is also a humanitarian and economical one as well because of the massive global impact it has. We continue to live our lives as if we are not at the forefront of the problem as politicians tell us that global warming is a natural occurrence instead of a man-made one. As human beings, we are the focal point of the problem. It is our duty to be the ones who salvage the remaining resources we have left for future generations. An idea that has been put forth by multiple carbon resource management agencies recently is the utilization of cap-and-trade market systems. With cap-and-trade systems, these agencies are able to trade permits for carbon sources so that the reservoirs are partitioned amongst various groups. Implementing such a system will result in a decrease of carbon dioxide emissions over time as long as it is utilized effectively from all parties involved. However, as long as there is economic growth there is lesser chance of governing bodies providing sufficient amounts of funding in order to repair the damage that has been done by pollution. The budget that governments allocate to resource preservation initiatives are far below the amount that needs to be allocated in order to see real change. It is estimated that the value of emissions permits will be roughly $60 billion a year in 2012 and will continue to increase up to $113 billion 2025.",

The text of the petition reads, in its entirety:We urge the United States government to reject the global warming agreement that was written in Kyoto, Japan in December, 1997, and any other similar proposals. The proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment, hinder the advance of science and technology, and damage the health and welfare of mankind.There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate. Moreover, there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth.Along with the cover letter from Seitz (see above), the petition was circulated with a manuscript plus a reprint of a December 1997 \"Wall Street Journal\" op-ed (\"Science Has Spoken: Global Warming Is a Myth\") by Arthur and Zachary Robinson. The current version of Seitz's letter describes the summary as \"a twelve page review of information on the subject of 'global warming'.\" The article is titled \"Environmental Effects of Increased Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide\" by Arthur B. Robinson, Noah E. Robinson, Sallie Baliunas and Willie Soon.",

Former National Academy of Sciences president Frederick Seitz, who, according to an article by Mark Hertsgaard in \"Vanity Fair\", earned about US$585,000 in the 1970s and 1980s as a consultant to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, went on to chair groups such as the Science and Environmental Policy Project and the George C. Marshall Institute alleged to have made efforts to \"downplay\" global warming. Seitz stated in the 1980s that \"Global warming is far more a matter of politics than of climate.\" Seitz authored the Oregon Petition, a document published jointly by the Marshall Institute and Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine in opposition to the Kyoto protocol. The petition and accompanying \"Research Review of Global Warming Evidence\" claimed: The proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment, hinder the advance of science and technology, and damage the health and welfare of mankind. There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate. \u2026 We are living in an increasingly lush environment of plants and animals as a result of the carbon dioxide increase. Our children will enjoy an Earth with far more plant and animal life than that with which we now are blessed. This is a wonderful and unexpected gift from the Industrial Revolution. George Monbiot wrote in \"The Guardian\" that this petition, which he criticizes as misleading and tied to industry funding, \"has been cited by almost every journalist who claims that climate change is a myth.\" Efforts by climate change denial groups played a significant role in the eventual rejection of the Kyoto protocol in the US.",

Anticipated effects include increasing global temperatures, rising sea levels, changing precipitation, and expansion of deserts in the subtropics. Warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the Arctic, with the continuing retreat of glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice. Other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts, heavy rainfall with floods, and heavy snowfall; ocean acidification; and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes. Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels. Because the climate system has a large \"inertia\" and greenhouse gases will remain in the atmosphere for a long time, many of these effects will persist for not only decades or centuries, but for tens of thousands of years to come.",
