Zollner states that \"None of Leonardo's works would exert more influence upon the evolution of the genre than the \"Mona Lisa\".

One notable work she created is \"Mona/Leo\", for which she compared the image of a Leonardo da Vinci self-portrait with the \"Mona Lisa\", matching the two faces feature by feature to show their underlying structural similarity. Specifically, she replaced the right side of the \"Mona Lisa\" with the flipped left side of a red chalk self-portrait of Leonardo. Superimposed lines drawn on the image showing the close alignments of the bottom of the eye, eyebrow, nose and chin prompted her to argue that the Mona Lisa is in part a cryptic self-portrait of the artist. In further experiments along these lines, she removed the gray tones in Leonardo da Vinci's self-portrait and superimposed the \"Mona Lisa\" eye over it. Not everyone is convinced by her argument for the identity of Leonardo da Vinci and the \"Mona Lisa\"; one common counter-argument is that the similarities are due to both portraits having been created by the same person and therefore bearing the hallmarks of a characteristic style. Additionally, though the drawing on which Schwartz based the comparison is held to be a self-portrait, there is no firm historical evidence to support this theory.",

Some researchers also believe that Sala\u00ec and not Lisa del Giocondo was the real model for the \"Mona Lisa\" but this claim is disputed by the Louvre. During Leonardo's second stay in Milan, he took another young pupil, Francesco Melzi. Unlike Sala\u00ec, Francesco was a son of a nobleman. When Leonardo traveled to Rome in 1513 and to France in 1516, Sala\u00ec and Melzi both accompanied him. As an adult, Melzi became secretary and main assistant of Leonardo, and undertook to prepare Leonardo's writings for publication. Vasari says that Melzi \"at the time of Leonardo was a very beautiful and very much loved young man\". In France, Francesco Melzi was greeted as \"Italian gentleman living with master Leonardo\" and granted donation of 400\u00a0ecus, while Sala\u00ec, already over 40\u00a0years old, was described as \"servant\" and granted a one time donation of 100\u00a0ecus. Sala\u00ec left Leonardo and France in 1518. He later returned to Milan to work on Leonardo's vineyard, previously worked by Sala\u00ec's father, half of which was granted to him by Leonardo's will. It is commonly believed that upon Leonardo's death in 1519, Sala\u00ec inherited several paintings including the \"Mona Lisa\". Through his estate, many of those works, notably the \"Mona Lisa\", passed into the possession of Francis I of France. While Leonardo left all personal belongings, paintings, drawings and notes to Francesco Melzi in his will, it's unclear whether this included the \"Mona Lisa\".",

Specifically, she replaced the right side of the \"Mona Lisa\" with the flipped left side of a red chalk self-portrait of Leonardo. Superimposed lines drawn on the image showing the close alignments of the bottom of the eye, eyebrow, nose and chin prompted her to argue that the Mona Lisa is in part a cryptic self-portrait of the artist. In further experiments along these lines, she removed the gray tones in Leonardo da Vinci's self-portrait and superimposed the \"Mona Lisa\" eye over it. Not everyone is convinced by her argument for the identity of Leonardo da Vinci and the \"Mona Lisa\"; one common counter-argument is that the similarities are due to both portraits having been created by the same person and therefore bearing the hallmarks of a characteristic style.

Experts at the Louvre reportedly supported the Prado museum's findings. The Prado replica was subsequently transported to the Louvre in 2012 to be displayed next to \"Mona Lisa\" as part of a temporary exhibition. Two nude paintings bearing similarities to Leonardo da Vinci's original were part of a 2009 exhibition of artwork inspired by \"Mona Lisa\". Displayed at the Museo Ideale in Leonardo's hometown of Vinci, near Florence, some believe one of the paintings\u00a0\u2013 dating from Leonardo's time\u00a0\u2013 to be the work of Leonardo himself, and it has at times been credited to him. Other experts theorize the painting, one of at least six known to exist, may be just another copy painted by \"followers\" of Leonardo. Scholarly dispute persists as to artist, subject and origin. The nude in question, discovered behind a wall in a private library, reportedly belonged to an uncle of Napoleon Bonaparte, who owned another of Leonardo's paintings. Facial features bear only vague resemblance, but landscape, compositional and technical details correspond to those of the \"Mona Lisa\" known worldwide today.",
