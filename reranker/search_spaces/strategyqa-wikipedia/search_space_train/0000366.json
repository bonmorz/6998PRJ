Maura Johnston of \"The Guardian\" wrote a negative review of the song, faulting the \"sloppy\" lyrics and blaming Swift for not giving a clear context in the lyrics. Lindsay Zolad of The Ringer said \"Unleashed on a deeply confused public late Thursday night, the song is a strange collage of retro reference points: mid-aughts Gossip Girl placement pop, the soundtrack to Disney's live-action Maleficent, and \u2014 yes, really \u2014 Right Said Fred's I'm Too Sexy, except devoid of the self-effacing humor and wit. Yes, the new Taylor Swift song just made me compliment Right Said Fred.\" Brittany Spanos of \"Rolling Stone\" believed that the song marked a continuation of the feud between Swift and rapper Kanye West; the latter had previously name-dropped Swift in his song \"Famous\" by using the line, \"I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? / I made that bitch famous\". The single was noted as being a darker, angrier work than what Swift had done before. Hugh McIntye of \"Forbes\" was critical of the change in style, saying that it \"didn't sound like [Swift]\" and that it \"may have some kinks to work out\". Meaghan Garvey from \"Pitchfork\" referred to it in a review as \"a hardcore self-own\" track.",

            "document": "Inscrutability of reference . In his indeterminacy of translation theory Quine claims that, if one is to translate a language, there are always several alternative translations, of which none is more correct than the other. A radical translation is therefore impossible. As a special part of this theory the inscrutability of reference indicates that, in trying to find out to which object a certain word (also sentence, sign etc.) of a language refers, there is never only one single possibility. That is even the case, if the possibilities that come into consideration lie very close together. Quine's example of the word \"gavagai\" is used to illustrate this. Note that it is also applied at the indeterminacy of translation, but has traditionally been introduced to point up referential inscrutability. The \"gavagai\" thought experiment tells about a linguist, who tries to find out, what the expression \"gavagai\" means, when uttered by a speaker of a yet unknown, native language upon seeing a rabbit. At first glance, it seems that \"gavagai\" simply translates with \"rabbit\". Now, Quine points out that the background language and its referring devices might fool the linguist here, because he is misled in a sense that he always makes direct comparisons between the foreign language and his own. However, when shouting \"gavagai\", and pointing at a rabbit, the natives could as well refer to something like \"undetached rabbit-parts\", or \"rabbit-tropes\" and it would not make any observable difference. The behavioural data the linguist could collect from the native speaker would be the same in every case, or to reword it, several translation hypotheses could be built on the same sensoric stimuli. Hence, the reference between the term \"gavagai\" and its referring object is language- or framework-dependent, and therefore inscrutable. Quine regards this discovery as trivial, because it is already a widely accepted fact that all the different things one word might refer to can be switched out, because of their proxy functions. Quine does not want to show that those native speakers might speak in interestingly different ways and we cannot know about it, but rather that there is nothing to be known. Not only is it impossible to discern, by any method, the correct translation and referential relation of \"gavagai\", but, in fact, there is not even a correct answer to this question. To make sense of the word \"gavagai\" either way, the linguist simply has to assume that the native speaker does not refer to complicated terms like \"rabbits-tropes\". The finding, then, that \"gavagai\" means \"rabbit\" is not really a translation, but merely a common sense interpretation. It is important to note that indeterminacy and inscrutability not only occur in the course of translating something from a native, unknown language into a familiar one, but among every language. This holds also for languages which are quite similar, like German and Dutch, and even for speakers of the same language. One cannot with certainty say, what exactly his/her conversational partner refers to, when that person is talking about a rabbit. We commonly use the homophonic rule in those cases, i.e., if one utters \"rabbit\", we assume s/he uses it in the same way we do. But, as has been shown, there are multiple possibilities which can be indistinguishable from one another. This also applies in our own case. We ourselves do not know what it is we are referring to in using the word \"rabbit\", that is because there is, in Quine's word, \"no fact of the matter\" at all. One must not, however, use different possible referential objects in the same translation, because they are incommensurable and the resulting translation hypothesis would contain logical fallacies.",

Although it is possible to extract commonly occurring phrases, it becomes more difficult if key concepts are inconsistently worded in phrases. Automated extraction indexing also has the problem that, even with use of a stop-list to remove common words, some frequent words may not be useful for allowing discrimination between documents. For example, the term glucose is likely to occur frequently in any document related to diabetes. Therefore use of this term would likely return most or all the documents in the database. Post-co-ordinated indexing where terms are combined at the time of searching would reduce this effect but the onus would be on the searcher to link appropriate terms as opposed to the information professional. In addition terms that occur infrequently may be highly significant for example a new drug may be mentioned infrequently but the novelty of the subject makes any reference significant. One method for allowing rarer terms to be included and common words to be excluded by automated techniques would be a relative frequency approach where frequency of a word in a document is compared to frequency in the database as a whole. Therefore a term that occurs more often in a document than might be expected based on the rest of the database could then be used as an index term, and terms that occur equally frequently throughout will be excluded. Another problem with automated extraction is that it does not recognise when a concept is discussed but is not identified in the text by an indexable keyword.",

These terms usually don't serve multiple roles like kinship terms (i.e. the term has only one grammatical person meaning). Words such as \"doctor\", \"teacher\", \"owner\", etc. can be used as a second-person personal pronoun when necessary. When referring to themselves, Vietnamese speakers, like speakers of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages, tend to deprecate their position while elevating the audience. While many of these terms are now obsolete, some remain in widespread usage. The most prominent of these words is \"t\u00f4i\", literally meaning \"servant\". It is used as a fairly neutral term for \"I\" (not very friendly, nor very formal). \"T\u1edb\", also meaning \"servant\", is also popular among young people to refer to themselves with close friends (used in conjunction with \"c\u1eadu\" for \"lad\").",

Things wouldn't go well for Oppa after Siu-Kat suspected him and he ran for it.

Although she felt guilty for her brother, Sin-Hang pretended to show no remorse.

In a 2012 interview, Swift remarked that in spite of keeping herself \"as educated and informed as possible\", she does not discuss politics, fearing that it might influence other people. Writing about media pressure on Swift to publicly take political stances, \"Politico\" called Swift \"studiously apolitical\". Swift has spent time with the Kennedy family and has spoken of her admiration for Ethel Kennedy. Swift is also a feminist. She has spoken out against LGBT discrimination. Following the 2008 murder of Larry King, she recorded a GLSEN PSA to combat hate crimes. On the first anniversary of King's death, Swift told \"Seventeen\" that her parents taught her \"never to judge others based on whom they love, what color their skin is, or their religion\". The music video for Swift's anti-bullying song \"Mean\" deals in part with homophobia in high schools; the video was nominated for an MTV VMA social activism award in 2011. \"The New York Times\" believes she is part of \"a new wave of young (and mostly straight) women who are providing the soundtrack for a generation of gay fans coming to terms with their identity in a time of turbulent and confusing cultural messages\".",

            "document": "Language and thought . Language also seems to shape how people from different cultures orient themselves in space. For instance, people from the Australian Aboriginal community Pormpuraaw define space relative to the observer. Instead of referring to location in terms like \"left\", \"right\", \"back\" and \"forward\", most Aboriginal Nations, such as the Kuuk Thaayorre, use cardinal-direction terms \u2013 north, south, east and west. For example, speakers from such cultures would say \"There is a spider on your northeast leg\" or \"Pass the ball to the south southwest\". In fact, instead of \"hello\", the greeting in such cultures is \"Where are you going?\" and sometimes even \"Where are you coming from?\" Such greeting would be followed by a directional answer \"To the northeast in the middle distance\". The consequence of using such language is that the speakers need to be constantly oriented in space, or they would not be able to express themselves properly, or even get past a greeting. Speakers of such languages that rely on absolute reference frames have a much greater navigational ability and spatial knowledge compared to speakers of languages that use relative reference frames (such as English). In comparison with English users, speakers of languages such as Kuuk Thaayorre are also much better at staying oriented even in unfamiliar spaces \u2013 and it is in fact their language that enables them to do this.",
