Fano asks us to first consider the attribution of length to a table. To do this, we must assume a set of laws concerning the interaction between the table and the measuring apparatus: the length of the table doesn't vary significantly during the measurement, length must be an additive quantity, \"longer than\" must be an asymmetric, transitive relation and so forth. By assuming these laws and carrying out a few operations, we reach the result of the measurement. There is a certain amount of holism in this process. For example, during the measurement process, we might discover that the table is much hotter than the measuring device, in which case the length of the latter will have been modified by the contact. Consequently, we need to modify the temperature of the measuring device. In some cases, we will even have to reconsider and revise some of our laws. This process can continue for some time until we are fairly confident of the results obtained. But it is not only necessary to have a theory of the interactions between the table and the measuring device, it is also necessary to attribute a set of predicates to the table: a certain temperature, rigidity, electric charge, etc... And the attribution of each of these predicates presupposes, in turn, another theory. So, the attribution of \"F\" to \"x\" presupposes \"Px\" and the theory formula_1, but \"Px\", in turn, presupposes \"P'x\" and formula_2 and so on. As a result, we have a series of predicates \"F\", \"P\", formula_3, formula_4... and a series of theories formula_5, formula_2, formula_7... As Fano states it, \"this process would seem like a \"regressus ad infinitum\", if it weren't that formula_8 converges toward a theory \"T\" which is nothing other than physics in its entirety.\" The same is true of the predicates, which converge toward the set of all the possible physical quantities. Fano calls this \"convergent holism\".",

That extends the pole to about , which is convenient for most work. Occasionally, additional height is needed and additional lengths can be added, but the pole becomes unwieldy at these greater heights.

The bootstrap sample is taken from the original by using sampling with replacement (e.g. we might 'resample' 5 times from [1,2,3,4,5] and get [2,5,4,4,1]), so, assuming N is sufficiently large, for all practical purposes there is virtually zero probability that it will be identical to the original \"real\" sample.

As in this proof, the Vitali lemma is frequently used when we are, for instance, considering the \"d\"-dimensional Lebesgue measure, formula_28, of a set \"E\"\u00a0\u2282 R, which we know is contained in the union of a certain collection of balls formula_6, each of which has a measure we can more easily compute, or has a special property one would like to exploit. Hence, if we compute the measure of this union, we will have an upper bound on the measure of \"E\". However, it is difficult to compute the measure of the union of all these balls if they overlap. By the Vitali lemma, we may choose a subcollection formula_30 which is disjoint and such that formula_31. Therefore,",
