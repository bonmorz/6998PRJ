Genghis had designated several of the territories south of the Caucasus to Jochi, specifically Georgia, and the Seljukid Sultanate.

Jin had captured power by displacing Khitan. Genghis told Chu'Tsai, who was a lineal descendant of Khitan rulers, that he had avenged Chu'Tsai's forefathers. Chu'Tsai responded that his father served the Jin dynasty honestly and so did he; also he did not consider his own father his enemy, so the question of revenge did not apply.

The Ilkhanate had been founded by Hulagu, another of Tolui's sons, who was therefore loyal to Kublai. The Golden Horde had been founded by Genghis' son Jochi, following the Mongol invasion of Central Asia. Genghis had designated several of the territories south of the Caucasus to Jochi, specifically Georgia, and the Seljukid Sultanate. Hulagu, with the backing of his brother the Great Khan Kublai, invaded and captured these territories in 1256, even installing his capital in the center of the disputed territories, at Maragha.

He was Sultan of the Middle Juz. He is a son of Tursun Khan and great grandfather of Alikhan Bukeikhanov. Barak Sultan was notable for having murdedred his rival beheading the first Kazakh Khan in Kazakh history who took citizenship of Russia - Khan of Junior Juz Abulkhair Khan. It was revenge for Abulkhair Khan's pro-Russian policy and the last point was the alleged robbery of a caravan laden with gifts from Barak Sultan to the ruler of the Khanate of Khiva during attacks by Abulkhair Khan against the Karakalpaks, who were also under Barak Sultan's rule. One of his wives was a daughter of Galdan Tseren. During that marriage and until the death of Galdan Tseren in 1745 the war and conflicts between Kazakh Khanate and Dzhungaria had been stopped. As a descendant of Genghis Khan Barak wanted to become the ruler of two Turkic-Mongol states - Dzhungaria and Kazakh Khanate. Barak Sultan and his eldest son had been poisoned by a pro-Russian agent from Middle Juz in 1750. The death of Barak Sultan opened opportunities to expand Russian Empire over the Kazakh Steppe.",

The link between Prester John and Genghis Khan was elaborated upon at this time, as the Prester became identified with Genghis' foster father, Toghrul, king of the Keraites, given the Jin title Ong Khan Toghrul. Fairly truthful chroniclers and explorers such as Marco Polo, Crusader-historian Jean de Joinville, and the Franciscan voyager Odoric of Pordenone stripped Prester John of much of his otherworldly veneer, portraying him as a more realistic earthly monarch. Odoric places John's land to the west of Cathay en route to Europe, and mentions its capital as Casan, which may correspond to Kazan, the Tatar capital near Moscow. Joinville describes Genghis Khan in his chronicle as a \"wise man\" who unites all the Tartar tribes and leads them to victory against their strongest enemy, Prester John. William of Rubruck says a certain \"Vut\", lord of the Keraites and brother to the Nestorian \"King\" John, was defeated by the Mongols under Genghis Khan. Genghis Khan made off with Vut's daughter and married her to his son, and their union produced M\u00f6ngke, the Khan at the time William wrote. According to Marco Polo's \"Travels\", the war between the Prester and Genghis Khan started when Genghis Khan, new ruler of the rebellious Tartars, asked for the hand of Prester John's daughter in marriage. Angered that his lowly vassal would make such a request, Prester John denied him in no uncertain terms. In the war that followed, Genghis Khan triumphed, and Prester John perished.",
