A general \"melee\" of several, lower-skilled gladiators was far less costly, but also less popular. Even among the \"ordinarii\", match winners might have to fight a new, well-rested opponent, either a \"tertiarius\" (\"third choice gladiator\") by prearrangement; or a \"substitute\" gladiator (\"suppositicius\") who fought at the whim of the \"editor\" as an unadvertised, unexpected \"extra\". This yielded two combats for the cost of three gladiators, rather than four; such contests were prolonged, and in some cases, more bloody. Most were probably of poor quality, but the emperor Caracalla chose to test a notably skilled and successful fighter named Bato against first one \"supposicitius\", whom he beat, and then another, who killed him. At the opposite level of the profession, a gladiator reluctant to confront his opponent might be whipped, or goaded with hot irons, until he engaged through sheer desperation. Combats between experienced, well trained gladiators demonstrated a considerable degree of stagecraft. Among the cognoscenti, bravado and skill in combat were esteemed over mere hacking and bloodshed; some gladiators made their careers and reputation from bloodless victories. Suetonius describes an exceptional \"munus\" by Nero, in which no-one was killed, \"not even \"noxii\" (enemies of the state).\"",

Different gladiator types specialized in specific weapons and fighting techniques. Combatants were usually pitted against opponents with different, but more or less equivalent equipment, for the sake of a fair and balanced contest. Most gladiators only fought others from within the same school or Ludus, but sometimes specific gladiators could be requested to fight one from another Ludus.",

Other \"retiarius\" tricks were to whip the net at his opponent's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him. The helmet of the \"secutor\" was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net. In most cases, the \"secutor\" knew to expect the net-man's tactics and tried to intercept and hold on to the weapon, possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net. In such danger, the \"retiarius\" could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger. The \"secutor\" stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it. Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the \"retiarius\" used his net. Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net, yet the class is named for the device, and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a \"retiarius\" in his satires. The discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance, and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict. The lack of nets in \"retiarius\" images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility is that some \"retiarii\" simply did not use nets. In most bouts, the \"retiarius\" probably had to resort to fighting with just his trident and dagger, placing him at a disadvantage. The trident was his primary weapon in such situations, and its length allowed the \"retiarius\" to keep his opponent at bay. He held the weapon two-handed, left nearer the prongs, so that he could parry his enemy's strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends. Wielded two-handed, the weapon could land powerful blows. Images show \"retiarii\" stabbing downward at the \"secutor\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s unshielded legs or stabbing down at the helmet in an attempt to poke through an eyehole. The trident itself was too weak to pierce the metal, although a skull found at Ephesus, Turkey, dating to CE\u00a0200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to the head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent. The \"secutor\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s helmet was rounded and free of protrusions to avoid snaring the net or being caught in the trident's prongs, but attacks on it forced the \"secutor\" to duck or hide behind his shield. This reduced his field of vision and gave the \"retiarius\" an advantage with his speed. Should the \"secutor\" strike with his sword, the \"retiarius\" parried with the trident prongs and attempted to disarm him. Likewise, the more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block the trident with his shield and force the net-man to lose it. Another type of gladiator, scissor could also be pitted against a \"retiarius\". Images from the Eastern Roman Empire show \"scissores\" wearing a tubular arm-guard in lieu of a shield. The guard fits over the left hand and ends in a hooked, knife-like blade that was probably intended to parry the net and trident or to snag and pull away the net. \"Scissores\" who succeeded in this probably dropped the hook weapon and fought with just a sword.",

So the Romans made use of the splendid armor of their enemies to do honor to the gods; while the Campanians, in consequence of their pride and in hatred of the Samnites, equipped after this fashion the gladiators who furnished them entertainment at their feasts, and bestowed on them the name of Samnites. Rome's own gladiatorial contests began some 40 years later. The Samnite, borrowed from the Campanians, was the earliest of the gladiator types and the model upon which later classes were based. The Samnite gladiators were also the first of at least three gladiator classes (\"list of Roman gladiator types\") to be based on ethnic antecedents; other examples were the Gauls and the Thracians.

In order for the fighters to protect themselves against their opponents they wrapped leather thongs around their fists. Eventually harder leather was used and the thong soon became a weapon. The Romans even introduced metal studs to the thongs to make the cestus which then led to a more sinister weapon called the myrmex ('limb piercer'). Fighting events were held at Roman Amphitheatres. The Roman form of boxing was often a fight until death to please the spectators who gathered at such events. However, especially in later times, purchased slaves and trained combat performers were valuable commodities, and their lives were not given up without due consideration. Often slaves were used against one another in a circle marked on the floor. This is where the term ring came from. In AD 393, during the Roman gladiator period, boxing was abolished due to excessive brutality. It was not until the late 16th century that boxing re-surfaced in London.",

German historian and experimental archeologist Marcus Junkelmann has propagated an idea, based on an unlabeled, unclear image that he decided might be a scissor, that this type of gladiator fought using a weapon consisting of a hardened steel tube that encased the gladiator's entire forearm, with the hand end capped off and a semicircular blade attached to it. A handle inside the tube might have allowed the gladiator to maintain control in the heat of battle.  This weapon might have been both deadly and versatile; the gladiator could use his protected arm to block his opponent's blows and quickly counterattack, the shape of the blade being such that even the slightest touch could cause a serious wound.",

At the arena, before a capacity crowd containing both Vorenus and Timon, Pullo is led into a small ring and handed a large sword, but he drops the sword on the ground and sits in the center of the ring, refusing to fight. Three gladiators come out and tell him to fight, but Pullo stubbornly refuses. The men won't have it, and taunt him with insults. But when they insult the XIII Legion, Pullo grows increasingly angry until finally he lashes out, killing all three of his opponents. He yells \"Thirteen!\", but the crowd boos him. More gladiators come out, and despite the crowd's taunting, Pullo cuts down one gladiator after another while Timon cheers and Vorenus simply watches. Eventually Pullo tires, having been wounded so many times he can barely stand, at which point a large carnifex enters and knocks the sword out of Pullo's tired hand with a skull-topped mace. Just as the carnifex is about to deal the death blow, Vorenus charges into the ring, picks up a weapon, yells \"Thirteen!\" and takes on the gladiator, eventually slicing his leg off and collapsing him to the ground, before killing him with his own weapon. As the crowd recovers from shock, a roar of approval rises up, and Vorenus helps his old comrade out of the ring.",

A general \"melee\" of several, lower-skilled gladiators was far less costly, but also less popular. Even among the \"ordinarii\", match winners might have to fight a new, well-rested opponent, either a \"tertiarius\" (\"third choice gladiator\") by prearrangement; or a \"substitute\" gladiator (\"suppositicius\") who fought at the whim of the \"editor\" as an unadvertised, unexpected \"extra\". This yielded two combats for the cost of three gladiators, rather than four; such contests were prolonged, and in some cases, more bloody. Most were probably of poor quality, but the emperor Caracalla chose to test a notably skilled and successful fighter named Bato against first one \"supposicitius\", whom he beat, and then another, who killed him. At the opposite level of the profession, a gladiator reluctant to confront his opponent might be whipped, or goaded with hot irons, until he engaged through sheer desperation. Combats between experienced, well trained gladiators demonstrated a considerable degree of stagecraft. Among the cognoscenti, bravado and skill in combat were esteemed over mere hacking and bloodshed; some gladiators made their careers and reputation from bloodless victories. Suetonius describes an exceptional \"munus\" by Nero, in which no-one was killed, \"not even \"noxii\" (enemies of the state).\"",

Similar in function to the javelin was the \"fuscina.\" Although not used by the Roman military, this fork-like trident was one of the most popular gladiator weapons. A version of the javelin that had a much longer and thinner tip was the \"pilum\", which could pierce armor or shields when thrown. Several \"pila\" could be thrown to initiate combat, disrupting the structure and defense of enemy armies and providing an opportunity for close combat, where the gladius would take over. The design of the \"pilum\" allowed it to become lodged in an enemy shield. Removing a \"pilum\" from a shield was often difficult and time consuming during combat. In fact, most were not reusable after removal.",
