After Matilda was widowed in 1125, she returned to her father in England, who then secured her marriage to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but after Henry I's death in 1135 Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned, before Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France.

The way we can find out the answer to this question is simply by asking Thomas if he believes it is possible. Thomas says no.

Of course not, since Thomas is probably angry and confuses his desire to break up with Ffion with his beliefs. So we ask him if he is angry with Ffion. He says that he is, but we cannot attribute to him the belief that the relationship \"can\" continue, because we don't really know if he's confusing his desires with his beliefs or vice versa.

The psalmist would then say that God made man that way, and because of this \u2018there is nothing wrong with it\u2019 and that \u2018everything God makes is good; therefore there is nothing wrong with it\u2019. The Greeks, as King informs us, \u2018felt the body was evil\u2019 and that the \u2018soul could never reach its full maturity until it broke loose from the prison of the body\u2019. However, Christianity raises the view that \u2018the body is not the principle of evil; it says the will is the principle of evil\u2019. He then defines that in \u2018any doctrine of man, we must be concerned with man's physical well being\u2019. To support this he brings up Jesus` quote that we need the \u201cbread\u201d to survive and also states \u2018this isn\u2019t the only part\u2019 and if we stop here we would see \u2018man merely as an animal\u2019. He then brings an example of chemists who calculated that the values of man came to \u2018about ninety-eight cents\u2019, today with our living standards it comes to \u2018a dollar ninety eight for the average man\u2019. King challenges this idea by questioning \u2018But can we explain the whole of man in terms of ninety eight cents?\u2019 and brings up examples of human genius; and again asks \u2018Can we explain the mystery of the human soul in terms of ninety eight cents?\u2019 To this he answers \u201cno\u201d and states that \u2018man is a child of God\u2019 and raises the second basic point of the doctrine \u2018that man is a being of spirit\u2019, which is the \u2018thou has crowned him with glory and honour\u2019, and because of our \u2018rational capacity, man has a mind, man can reason. This distinguishes us from the lower animals\u2019. King then defines man as \u2018God\u2019s marvellous creation. Through his mind he can leap oceans, break through walls, and transcend the categories of time and space\u2019. With this he defines what the biblical writers meant when they said \u2018man is made in the image of God\u2019, and that he has \u2018rational capacity; he has the unique ability to have a fellowship with God.

The Spekkens toy model is based on the knowledge balance principle: \"the number of questions about the physical state of a system that are answered must always be equal to the number that are unanswered in a state of maximal knowledge.\" However, the \"knowledge\" one can possess about a system must be carefully defined for this principle to have any meaning. To do this, the concept of a \"canonical\" set of yes or no questions is defined as the minimum number of questions needed. For example, for a system with 4 states, one can ask \"Is the system in state 1?\", \"Is the system in state 2?\" and \"Is the system in state 3?\" which would determine the state of the system (state 4 being the case if all three questions were answered \"No.\"). However, one could also ask \"Is the system in either state 1 or state 2?\" and \"Is the system in either state 1 or state 3?\", which would also uniquely determine the state, and has only two questions in the set. This set of questions is not unique, however it is clear that at least two questions (bits) are required to exactly represent one of four states. We say that for a system with 4 states, the number of questions in a canonical set is two. As such, in this case, the knowledge balance principle insists that the maximum number of questions in a canonical set that one can have answered at any given time is one, such that the amount of knowledge is equal to the amount of ignorance.",

He also noted how the meetings at Panmunjom were usually unproductive, due to the particular negotiating style of the North Koreans: As one example, we would go up with a proposal of some sort on the release of the crew and they would be sitting there with a card catalog... If the answer to the particular proposal we presented wasn\u2019t in the cards, they would say something that was totally unresponsive and then go off and come back to the next meeting with an answer that was directed to the question. But there was rarely an immediate answer. That happened all through the negotiations. Their negotiators obviously were never empowered to act or speak on the basis of personal judgment or general instructions. They always had to defer a reply and presumably they went over it up in Pyongyang and passed it around and then decided on it. Sometimes we would get totally nonsensical responses if they didn\u2019t have something in the card file that corresponded to the proposal at hand. Ericson and George Newman, the Deputy Chief of Mission in Seoul, wrote a telegram for the State Department in February 1968, predicting how the negotiations would play out: What we said in effect was this: If you are going to do this thing at Panmunjom, and if your sole objective is to get the crew back, you will be playing into North Korea's hands and the negotiations will follow a clear and inevitable path. You are going to be asked to sign a document that the North Koreans will have drafted. They will brook no changes. It will set forth their point of view and require you to confess to everything they accuse you of... If you allow them to, they will take as much time as they feel they need to squeeze every damn thing they can get out of this situation in terms of their propaganda goals, and they will try to exploit this situation to drive a wedge between the U.S. and the ROK. Then when they feel they have accomplished all they can, and when we have agreed to sign their document of confession and apology, they will return the crew. They will not return the ship. This is the way it is going to be because this is the way it has always been.",

You will hear nothing more from us at present. [This is a uniform custom of all the Native Americans. When the council was again convened, Metea continued.] We meet you here to-day, because we had promised it, to tell you our minds, and what we have agreed upon among ourselves. You will listen to us with a good mind, and believe what we say. You know that we first came to this country, a long time ago, and when we sat ourselves down upon it, we met with a great many hardships and difficulties. Our country was then very large; but it has dwindled away to a small spot, and you wish to purchase that! This has caused us to reflect much upon what you have told us; and we have, therefore, brought all the chiefs and warriors, and the young men and women and children of our tribe, that one part may not do what others object to, and that all may be witnesses of what is going forward. You know your children. Since you first came among them, they have listened to your words with an attentive ear, and have always hearkened to your counsels. Whenever you have had a proposal to make to us, whenever you have had a favor to ask of us, we have always lent a favorable ear, and our invariable answer has been \u2018yes.\u2019 This you know! A long time has passed since we first came upon our lands, and our old people have all sunk into their graves. They had sense. We are all young and foolish, and do not wish to do anything that they would not approve, were they living. We are fearful we shall offend their spirits, if we sell our lands; and we are fearful we shall offend you, if we do \"not\" sell them. This has caused us great perplexity of thought, because we have counselled among ourselves, and do not know how we can part with the land. Our country was given to us by the Great Spirit, who gave it to us to hunt upon, to make our cornfields upon, to live upon, and to make down our beds upon when we die. And he would never forgive us, should we bargain it away. When you first spoke to us for lands at St. Mary\u2019s, we said we had a little, and agreed to sell you a piece of it; but we told you we could spare no more. Now you ask us again. You are never satisfied! We have sold you a great tract of land already; but it is not enough! We sold it to you for the benefit of your children, to farm and to live upon. We have now but little left. We shall want it all for ourselves. We know not how long we may live, and we wish to have some lands for our children to hunt upon. You are gradually taking away our hunting-grounds. Your children are driving us before them. We are growing uneasy. What lands you have, you may retain forever; but we shall sell no more. You think, perhaps, that I speak in passion; but my heart is good towards you. I speak like one of your own children. I am an Indian, a red-skin, and live by hunting and fishing, but my country is already too small; and I do not know how to bring up my children, if I give it all away. We sold you a fine tract of land at St. Mary\u2019s. We said to you then, it was enough to satisfy your children, and the last we should sell: and we thought it would be the last you would ask for. We have now told you what we had to say. It is what was determined on, in a council among ourselves; and what I have spoken, is the voice of my nation. On this account, all our people have come here to listen to me; but do not think we have a bad opinion of you. Where should we get a bad opinion of you? We speak to you with a good heart, and the feelings of a friend. You are acquainted with this piece of land\u2014the country we live in. Shall we give it up? Take notice, it is a small piece of land, and if we give it away, what will become of us? The Great Spirit, who has provided it for our use, allows us to keep it, to bring up our young men and support our families. We should incur his anger, if we bartered it away. If we had more land, you should get more; but our land has been wasting away ever since the white people became our neighbors, and we have now hardly enough left to cover the bones of our tribe. You are in the midst of your red children. What is due to us in money, we wish, and will receive at this place; and we want nothing more. We all shake hands with you. Behold our warriors, our women, and children. Take pity on us and on our words.\u201d",

How can we know if we have enough evidence to warrant a conclusion? The answer to this question is; we don't know. We can't know this unless we start analyzing the data.

            "document": "Elbow Room (book) . Some complaints about \"Elbow Room\" relate to our intuitions about free will. Some say that Dennett's theory does not satisfactorily deal with the issue of why we feel so strongly that we do have behavioral choice. One answer to this question is the result of selection on individuals to live harmoniously in society. But one doesn't have to be free to achieve that goal. Another answer is that it tells us (our brains) whether we're doing something or someone else is doing something to us (e.g. shaking arm). But, again one does not have to be free to make such a distinction. A final answer to this question is that our sensation of having behavioral choice has been carefully selected by evolution. The well-developed human sensation of having free will and being able to select among possible behaviors has strong survival value. People who lose the feeling that they can plan alternative behaviors and execute their choice of possible behaviors tend to become fatalistic and stop struggling for survival. According to Dennett, belief in free will is a necessary condition for having free will. When we are planning for the future and thinking about possible actions to take in the future, we are utilizing considerable amounts of biologically expensive resources (brain power). Evolution has designed us to feel strongly that all of our effort of planning pays off, that we control what we do. If this connection between our brains' efforts to model reality and predict the future and so make possible good outcomes is disconnected from our sense of self and our will, then fatalism and self-destructive behaviors are close at hand. However, the same effect is attainted if, despite not believing in the control free will gives, we believe that does not prevent us to live as fully as our bodies allow us to and to try harder to achieve things if we think we have agency.",
