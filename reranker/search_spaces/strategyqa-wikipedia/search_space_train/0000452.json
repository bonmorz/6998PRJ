More specifically, nearly 34% answered \"I do not believe in God\" and about 30% answered \"I do not know if there is a God and there is no way to find out.\" In the same study, 28% said they believed in God and 8% believed in a higher power that was not God.

Instead, factors such as upbringing, age, and family size were significant influences on religious identification since those who had religious upbringing were more likely to be religious and those who had a non-religious upbringing were more likely to not be religious.

Pope John Paul II emphasizes heavily on protecting a person's dignity in using media, which will require a positive development, that has clear structure, since media not only provide for mere entertainment, but has close connections to all areas of human life, \"i.e. Politics, economy, culture\". There are three \u201cfundamental options\u201d) the Church and her members face today: formation, participation, and dialogue. First, the formation of media has to be closely observed and filtered, such as formation of a new vocabulary used widely in media, then spreading to everyday language. Pope John Paul II notes that without \u201cproper formation,\u201d) the media would no longer be serving humanity, but shaping our beliefs and minds. In this, chiefly the younger generation are the most concerned, who would need critical and responsible education on the use of media(11). Second, a true participation by all members are encouraged, in which the Pope calls for a \u201cculture of co-responsibility,\u201d towards handling of media. Lastly, mass media's role of promoting dialogue and as tool of reciprocal knowledge is highlighted. However, this feature is like a double-edged sword, in that if used for good purpose, it can become the most powerful tool in spreading peace and understandings amongst humanity, or, \u201ca destructive weapon\u201d) if it were to be used in a negative manner. Pope John Paul II refers to his predecessors, who have discussed about such features of media we face today, such as Pius XII. Pius XII recognized the value of public opinion within and towards the Church, which is a strong feature of media communications. Also, according to the Code of Canon Law, everyone has a right to express their opinion. Therefore, John Paul II is telling the readers that his goal of writing such document on media today, isn't aiming for complete control and coercion over the people's mind and opinions. Although the Church must not leave room for arbitrary interpretations of the faith, by no means it is promoting the absolute power of the Church\u2014rather, he notes that the dialogue between the faithful is valued within the Church. John Paul II expands on the promotion of dialogues, yet he notes that although the Church is open to all, there will be times when an \u201cadequate confidentiality\u201d is required for the good of all.",

First, he believed that God existed. Second, he believed that God was \"Plus Supra\". Lastly, he believed that God was the origin of nature; that is, nature was the expression of God. As regards the first notion, Dr. Rizal made explicit that he believed that God existed. He was convinced that a supernatural power behind all of creation had to exist. He says to Fr. Pastells, \"We are entirely in accord in admitting the existence of God: how can I doubt it when I am convinced of my own existence? Who recognizes the effect recognizes the cause.\" It was clear that Dr. Rizal subscribed to the idea of \"necessary-contingent beings\" where the contingent being needed other beings for it to exist while the necessary being existed on its own. As such, the necessary being becomes the origin of contingent beings. This necessary being has been labelled by many as \"God.\" Dr. Rizal considered himself as a contingent being that needed other beings to sustain his existence. Such other beings included the origin of all; the necessary being, God. He accepted that he was part of the whole of creation. He could not deny himself. Hence, he could not deny creation. As such, he could not deny God. As regards the second notion, Dr. Rizal argued that his God was not like the God of the Catholics, as his God was far above such things. He says to Fr. Pastells, \"In the conviction that I find myself before the Supreme Problem, which confused voices desire to explain to me, I cannot but answer: 'That may be so; but the God that I surmise is much greater, much better: \"Plus Supra\"!\" He thought that a requirement to the Godliness of God was His being above all things, which meant His being incomprehensible.  Dr. Rizal was clearly not convinced that a sufficient understanding of God that was as powerful and metaphysical as the Supreme Being could be contained in the consciousness of little mortals who have no capacity to understand beyond what was in the words of Nietzsche \"divined\" to them. Mortals who were so limited could not have possibly comprehended a limitless being. As such, Dr. Rizal articulated that the only genuine faith was \"blind faith.\" In short, the more people tried to explain to him what and who God was, the more he got convinced that they did not know what they were talking about. What Dr. Rizal meant by \"blind faith\" was, since it was impossible to comprehend God as He was \"Plus Supra\", he could have only hinged his belief on the fact that \"God was God.\" As such, he did not deny nor did he accept the religious explanations of the mortals around him. Blind faith was more of a disposition of philosophy than of religion. It was a disposition where one did not accept and deny despite having a personal conviction. As regards the third notion, Dr. Rizal believed that if one was to \"understand\" God, he was going to do well to note that books which others claimed were tools of revelation were not reliable. The reason was books were too removed from actual reality as these were written by people, interpreted by others, rewritten by people, obscured by others, etc. The best way to have an idea of God was through connecting with Him personally, directly and physically through His extensions. These extensions were nature. Dr. Rizal says to Fr. Pastells, \"I believe in revelation, yes, but in that living revelation of nature which surrounds us everywhere, in that potent voice, eternal, incessant, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal like the Being from which it originates, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can reveal to us better the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom?\" Clearly, Dr. Rizal's philosophico-religious view on God was well-reflected on. It was a product of competent ratiocination by an \"Indio\" whom the Spaniards then undermined. He did not content himself with the teachings he grew up with as a student of Catholic institutions. He explored, rationalized, and argued. He asked questions about faith and the fundamental teachings of the Church. He was however careful not to offend the religious sensibilities of his countrymen. To him, ratiocination was simply a gift from God. To not use it would thus have been offensive to the Giver.",

Since the provinces North Brabant and Limburg are in the Netherlands historically mostly Roman Catholic, and some of their people still use the term and some traditions as a base for their cultural identity rather than as a religious identity. A planned visit of Pope Francis to the Netherlands was blocked by cardinal Wim Eijk in 2014, allegedly because of the feared lack of interest for the Pope among the Dutch public. The vast majority of the Catholic population in the Netherlands is now largely irreligious in practice. Research among self-identified Catholics in the Netherlands, published in 2007, shows that only 27% of the Dutch Catholics can be regarded as a theist, 55% as an ietsist, deist or agnostic and 17% as atheist. In 2015 only 13% of self-identified Dutch Catholics believe in the existence of heaven, 17% in a personal God and fewer than half believe that Jesus was the Son of God or sent by God.",

            "document": "Kurien Kunnumpuram . For a casual observer the Church is just a social reality \u2013 an association of human beings who profess a common faith, who participate in a common worship and who endeavour to live by a common ethical code. But for believing Christians the Church is also a faith reality. There is a grace-filled depth to the Church. In the Apostles\u2019 Creed we profess: \"We believe in the holy Catholic Church.\" It is the faith understanding of the Church that will be articulated here.  The Church is not a purely human enterprise. God is at work in the origin and development of the Church. That is what we Christians believe. St. Paul speaks of \"the Church of God that is at Corinth\" (1 Cor. 1:2). This probably refers to the local Christian community there. In The Bible \"the Church of the living God\" most likely denotes the entire world-wide assembly of the followers of Jesus Christ. The Second Vatican Council (1962\u201365) spoke of the mystery of the Church. The Church is a mystery because it is part of God\u2019s plan of salvation. In the New Testament, particularly in the Letters of Paul, mystery refers to the divine design for the salvation of humankind. It was God\u2019s plan to offer to everyone the possibility of salvation and to assemble in the Church all those who would believe in his Son. When we say that the Church is a mystery we not only mean that the Church is part of God\u2019s plan of salvation for humankind but also that God is at all times present and active in the Church. As Pope Paul VI stated: \"The Church is a mystery. It is a reality imbued with the hidden presence of God.\". The expression, the Church of God, also signifies a Church that is rooted in the experience of God. Just as Israel originated in the experience of the liberating God in Exodus, so too the Christian Church sprang up from the experience of the saving God in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. One becomes a member of the Church by sharing this experience. Against this background we can see how significant it is that in Ecclesia in Asia Pope John Paul II exhorts the Church to be ever more deeply \"rooted in the experience of God which flows from a living faith.\" Only then can the Church fulfil its vocation to be a meeting place of God and human beings. As the Pope declares: \"The Church cannot therefore be understood merely as a social organization or agency of human welfare. Despite having sinful men and women in her midst, the Church must be seen as the privileged place of encounter between God and human beings, in which God chooses to reveal the mystery of his inner life and carry out his plan of salvation for the world.\"",

He asserted that agnosticism is a choice of comfort, pride, dominion, and utility over truth, and is opposed by the following attitudes: the keenest self-criticism, humble listening to the whole of existence, the persistent patience and self-correction of the scientific method, a readiness to be purified by the truth.",

            "document": "Catholic views on God . In the fourth century Aetius and Eunomius maintained that, because the Divine nature is simple, excluding all composition or multiplicity, the various terms and names applied to God are to be considered synonymous. Otherwise they would erroneously imply composition in God. This opinion was combated by St. Cyril of Alexandria, St. Basil, and St. Gregory of Nyssa (In Eunom., P. G., XLV). The principle of attribution received more precise statement at the hands of St. Augustine, in his investigation of the conditions of intellectual knowledge (De Genesi ad Litteram, IV, 32). In the ninth century, John Scotus Erigena, who was largely influenced by Neo-Platonism, transmitted through the works of the Pseudo-Dionysius, contributed to bring into clearer relief the analogical character of predication (De Divin\u00e2 Natur\u00e2, Lib. I). The Nominalists revived the views of Eunomius, and the opposition of the Realists was carried to the other extreme by Gilbert de la Porr\u00e9e, who maintained a real, ontological distinction between the Divine Essence and the attributes. His opinion was condemned by the Council of Reims (1148). St. Thomas definitively expressed the doctrine that, after some controversies between Scotists and Thomists upon minor points and subtleties, and with some divergence of opinion upon unimportant details, is now the common teaching of Catholic theologians and philosophers. It may be summarized as follows: The idea of God is derived from our knowledge of finite beings. When a term is predicated of the finite and of the Infinite, it is used, not in a univocal, but in analogical sense. The Divine Perfection, one and invisible, is, in its infinity, the transcendental analogue of all actual and possible finite perfections. By means of an accumulation of analogous predicates methodically co-ordinated, we endeavour to form an approximate conception of the Deity who, because He is Infinite, cannot be comprehended by finite intelligence. Modern philosophy presents a remarkable gradation, from Pantheism, which finds God in everything, to Agnosticism, which declares that He is beyond the reach of knowledge. Spinoza conceives God as \"a substance consisting of infinite attributes each of which expresses eternal and infinite essence\". The two attributes manifested to us are thought and extension. At the other extreme we find Agnostics of the school of Herbert Spencer (see agnosticism) and some followers of Hegel, who hold that the nature of God, or, to use their favourite term, \"the Absolute\" is utterly unknowable, and its existence not determined to any mode; therefore, to predicate of it various attributes, expressive of determinations, is idle and misleading. Between the finite and the Infinite there is no common ground of predication. Hence, words that signify finite perfections can have no real meaning when predicated of God. They become mere empty symbols. All theological attempts to elaborate an idea of God are vain, and result in complete absurdity when they conceive God after man's image and likeness (see anthropomorphism), and circumscribe the Infinite in terms borrowed from human psychology. Criticism of this kind indicates that its authors have never taken the trouble to understand the nature of analogical predication, or to consider fairly the rigorous logical process of refining to which terms are subjected before being predicated of God. It often happens too, that writers, after indulging liberally in eloquent denunciation of theological anthropomorphism proceed, on the next page, to apply to the Infinite, presumably in a strictly univocal sense, terms such as \"energy\", \"force\", and \"law\", which are no less anthropomorphic, in an ultimate analysis, than \"will\" and \"intelligence\".",
