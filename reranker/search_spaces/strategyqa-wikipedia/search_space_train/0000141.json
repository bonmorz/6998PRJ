In the earlier series there was the ongoing Temporal Cold War plot, with the Xindi attack at the end of the second season resulting in a season long story arc during season three. Instead season four was split up into several smaller arcs which had been planned before the start of the season. The first of these arcs was a resolution to the long running Temporal Cold War, with Braga stating that the intention was \"to resolve [it]... once and for all\". This would also mark the final appearance of the Suliban in \"Enterprise\" as they were tied into that storyline. However, the episodes wrapping up the cold war did not reveal the identity of \"future guy\", the person from the future who was advising the Suliban. Braga explained in a pre-season interview that \"Well, we've been debating that for quite some time, and I'll leave that question open. We haven't decided yet. We have some ideas about him \u2014 or her \u2014 or it. But we haven't settled on any one identity yet.

Stewart was disappointed that a scene in which Picard and Anij kiss was cut from the final version of the film, saying that \"It was a studio decision, but still somewhat inexplicable to me as I feel the audience were waiting for some kind of romantic culmination to the relationship, which did happen and was extremely pleasant.\" Stewart received a producer's credit on the film. Jonathan Frakes appeared as Commander William Riker, and as with \"First Contact\" he directed the project. Brent Spiner starred as Lieutenant Commander Data. Spiner had asked for his character to be killed off in \"Insurrection\" because he was concerned that he was getting too old to play the role. His copy of the script came with a note from the production team saying, \"Sorry, kill you later\". The underwater scene required Spiner to wear more make-up than usual because it needed to be waterproof.

[[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] explained that the stand-alone films would not cross over with the films of the sequel trilogy, stating: [[George Lucas|George]] was so clear as to how that works. The canon that he created was the \"[[Star Wars]]\" saga. Right now, \"[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|Episode VII]]\" falls within that canon. The spinoff movies, or we may come up with some other way to call those films, they exist within that vast universe that he created. There is no attempt being made to carry characters (from the stand-alone films) in and out of the saga episodes. Consequently, from the creative standpoint, it's a roadmap that George made pretty clear. [[John Knoll]], visual effects supervisor for the \"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy, [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] the idea for the film 10 years before its development; after the Disney acquisition he felt as if he had to pitch it again or forever wonder \"what might've happened if I had\". In May 2014, Disney announced that [[Gareth Edwards (director)|Gareth Edwards]] would direct the film and [[Gary Whitta]] would write the script. That October, cinematographer [[Greig Fraser]] revealed that he would work on the film. In January 2015, it was revealed that Whitta had completed his work on the script, and would no longer be with the project. [[Simon Kinberg]] was considered as a replacement. Later in the month, it was announced that [[Chris Weitz]] had signed to write the script for the film. In March 2015, the title was announced. In July 2016, discussing whether the film would feature an [[Star Wars opening crawl|opening crawl]], Kennedy said, \"we're in the midst of talking about it, but I don't think these [\"Anthology\"] films will have an opening crawl.\" Edwards said: \"The idea is this film is supposed to be different than the saga films... [however,] this film is born out of a crawl. The thing that inspired this movie was a crawl and what was written in that. There's this feeling that if we did a crawl, then it'll create another movie. And so the honest answer is you'll have to wait and see.\" That same month, at the 2016 \"Star Wars\" Celebration, Edwards said the title had three meanings: \"a military sign\", referring to the [[Red Squadron]] from \"A New Hope\"; \"the 'rogue' one\" of the franchise, given that it is the first film to not be part of the main saga; and a description of Jyn Erso's personality. In November 2016, Kennedy confirmed that the film would not feature an opening crawl, instead beginning in \"a way that is traditional, with just the title.\"",
