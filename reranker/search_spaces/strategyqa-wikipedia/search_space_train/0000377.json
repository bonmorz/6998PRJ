Reconstruction ended the remnants of Confederate nationalism and of slavery, making the newly free slaves citizens with civil rights apparently guaranteed by three new Constitutional amendments. Three visions of Civil War memory appeared during Reconstruction: the reconciliationist vision, which was rooted in coping with the death and devastation the war had brought; the white supremacist vision, which included terror and violence; and the emancipationist vision, which sought full freedom, citizenship, and Constitutional equality for African Americans.",

Some Chinese cash coins were known to display features commonly seen in Chinese numismatic charms, Chinese coins with charm features have been created over two thousand years ago with the early Ban Liang and Wu Zhu cash coins, and when the first Chinese charms started appearing during the Han dynasty these coins were already commonplace. Many government issued cash coins and other currencies such as Spade and Knife money that did not have any extra charm-like features were considered to also have \u201ccharm-like qualities\u201d and were treated as charms by some people. The Wang Mang era Knife coin with a nominal value of 5,000 cash coins was often seen as a charm by the people because the character (or 1000) is written very similar to the character which means \"son\" so the inscription of the Knife coin could be read as \"worth five sons\" as this was very much desired in ancient Chinese society. A coin from Shu Han with the nominal value of 100 Wu Zhu cash coins featured a fish on the reverse of the inscription which symbolises \"abundance\" and \"perseverance\" in Chinese culture. Another Shu Han era coin contained the inscription of Tai Ping Bai Qian which was taken as an omen of peace and this coin is often considered to be a peace charm. During the Jin dynasty a coin was issued with the inscription \"f\u0113ng hu\u00f2\" (\u8c50\u8ca8) which could be translated as \"(the) coin of abundance\" and it was believed by the people at the time that if someone would possess this coin that this would be economically beneficial for them which is why this coin is commonly referred to as the \"cash of riches\" in popular tongue. During the Tang dynasty period images of clouds, crescents, and stars were often added on coins which the Chinese continued to use in subsequent dynasties. During the Jurchen Jin dynasty coins were cast with reverse inscriptions that featured characters from the twelve earthly branches and ten heavenly stems. During the Ming dynasty stars were sometimes used decoratively on some official government produced cash coins. Under the Manchu Qing dynasty \"y\u014dng zh\u00e8ng t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" (\u96cd\u6b63\u901a\u5bf6) cash coins cast by the Lanzhou Mint were considered to be charms or amulets capable of warding off evil spirits and demons because the Manchu word \"gung\" looked similar to the broadsword used by the Chinese God of War, Emperor Guan. The commemorative \"k\u0101ng x\u012b t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" (\u5eb7\u7199\u901a\u5bf6) cast for the Kangxi Emperor's 60th birthday in the year 1713 was believed to have \"the powers of a charm\" immediately when it entered circulation, this commemorative coin vontains a slightly different version of the Hanzi symbol \"\", at the bottom of the cash, as this character would most commonly have a vertical line at the left part of it but did not have it, and the part of this symbol which was usually inscripted as \"\" has the middle part written as a \"\" instead. Notably, the upper left area of the symbol \"\" only contains a single dot as opposed of the usual two dots used during this era. Several myths were attributed to this coin over the following three-hundred years since it has been cast such as the myth that the coin was cast from molten down golden statues of the 18 disciples of the Buddha which earned this coin the nicknames \"the Lohan coin\" and \"Arhat money\". These commemorative \"k\u0101ng x\u012b t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" cash coins were given to children as \"y\u0101 su\u00ec qi\u00e1n\" (\u58d3\u6b72\u9322) during Chinese new year, some women wore them akin to how an engagement ring is worn today, and in rural Shanxi young men wore this special \"k\u0101ng x\u012b t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" cash coin between their teeth like men from cities had golden teeth.

The city very often placed the image of its patron saint on its coins. The date came to be stamped on coins that were struck during the vacancies of the Holy See, occasionally at first, and later as a rule; it rarely appears on other coins before 1550; the practice became general in the seventeenth century, the year of the Christian era or that of the pontificate being used; and Gregory XVI established it by law, as also the requirement that each coin should bear upon it an expression of its value. At Bologna as early as the seventeenth century, the value of gold or silver coins was usually indicated with the figures 20, 40, 80, etc., i.e. so many bolognini or baiocchi; at Rome, in the eighteenth century, nearly all the copper coins bore an indication of their value. The rim of papal coins rarely bore an inscription; at most, the monogram of the city in which the coin was struck was stamped upon it. From the sixteenth century, the engravers, also, put their ciphers on the coins; among these engravers may be named Benvenuto Cellini, Francesco Raibolini, called il Francia (Bologna), the four Hamerani, Giulio Romano (trident), Cavaliere Lucenti, Andrea Perpenti etc. Until the time of Pius VI, the dies for the mint remained the property of the engravers.",

Until 1954, the entire mintage of such issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market, and in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the coin collecting hobby, where they sought to purchase the new issues. Among the pieces which had recently been struck and had appreciated in value was the 1935 Old Spanish Trail half dollar. This piece had been issued at the behest of L. W. Hoffecker, a Texas entrepreneur and coin dealer, who put aside a fifth of the 10,000 mintage for himself and sold them well into the 1940s, by which time he had served as president of the American Numismatic Association (ANA). Congress authorized an explosion of commemorative coins in 1936; no fewer than fifteen were issued for the first time. At the request of the groups authorized to purchase them, several coins minted in prior years were produced again, dated 1936, senior among them the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar, first struck in 1926. Thomas G. Melish, a coin collector and entrepreneur from Cincinnati, came up with an idea for a commemorative coin that he would control and from which he could profit. Melish was a prominent businessman who had inherited the Bromwell Wire Company. He formed the Cincinnati Musical Center Commemorative Coin Association, and secured the introduction of H.R. 10264 on January 31, 1936. This bill would have provided for 10,000 coins from the Philadelphia Mint, 2,000 coins from Denver, and 3,000 from the San Francisco Mint. Such a low mintage would have made the Denver coin a significant rarity, increasing Melish's profit. On February 17, the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures recommended that it be amended to provide for a total of 15,000 coins without dictating at what mint or mints they should be struck. That committee, in its report accompanying the bill, noted that the piece was \"in commemoration of the fiftieth (golden) anniversary of Cincinnati, Ohio, as a center of music, and its contribution of the annual May festival to the art of music for the past 50 years.\" Melish, through political influence, was able to retain the provision that they should be struck \"at the mints\", allowing coinage at all three mints. This marked the last time that a coinage bill would pass Congress in the 1930s with that phrasing\u2014later issues were limited to a single mint.",
