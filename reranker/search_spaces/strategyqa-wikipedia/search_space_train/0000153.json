On September 23, 2009, during his opening monologue, O'Brien told a very brief joke about Newark, and a supposed health care program for the city's citizens that would involve Newark giving them a bus ticket out of the city. Newark mayor Cory Booker responded in a satirical YouTube video calling for O'Brien to apologize, and that Conan would be banned from ever entering Newark Liberty International Airport until doing so. Conan responded by further making fun of Newark, however, saying the only way he could get to Newark now would be like everyone else, \"through a series of poor decisions.\" He also called out Cory Booker to come on the show to air out their grievances, deciding to then ban Booker from Burbank airport, adding later that he had absolutely no power to do so. Booker subsequently banned Conan from the state of New Jersey as well as all the sister cities of Newark. In response, O'Brien read a letter on air from Elizabeth, New Jersey mayor Chris Bollwage, declaring that he will temporarily rename Terminal A of Newark Liberty (which lies in Elizabeth) the Conan O'Brien Terminal. Conan continued, saying he had created a \"geographic toilet seat\" around Newark. The mayors of Bayonne, East Orange, Kearny, Jersey City, and Elizabeth have publicly sided with Conan O'Brien. He ended this by saying, \"Your move, Mayor Booker.\" The feud was unofficially ended when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for it to end during a prepared comedy bit, telling Booker to \"chalk it up\" to Conan. The following week Conan announced that Cory Booker would be a guest on the October 16, 2009 show to mend the feud. That night, O'Brien and his wife donated $50,000 to the Newark Now Organization, and NBC Universal matched Conan's donation to total a $100,000 gift. Booker also admitted that he is a big Conan fan and often tapes shows to watch the next day or watches them on the website Hulu.",

O'Brien's successful hosting job at the 2002 54th Primetime Emmy Awards \"sent out the most resounding message yet about his growing strength as a performer\", and a year later, NBC broadcast O'Brien's tenth anniversary special in primetime. By the time Leno's contract again came up for renewal, a discussion would be needed regarding the future of \"The Tonight Show\".

For a brief time in fall 2009, NBC followed a significantly different model in September 2009, following severe losses of audience for its scripted dramas. Jay Leno, formerly the host of NBC's long-running \"Tonight Show\" franchise, had moved his show to 10:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern Time, \"ahead\" of the local newscasts on most stations in a time slot that competes with CBS's and ABC's prime time programming (though Fox affiliates would have cut to post-primetime news or sitcom reruns by this time). Beginning in September 2009, Leno hosted \"The Jay Leno Show\", which was mostly similar to \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" with a few adjustments. This made way for Conan O'Brien (formerly the host of \"Late Night\", another long-running NBC late night franchise) to take over \"The Tonight Show\", while Jimmy Fallon has assumed hosting duties for \"Late Night\". The remaining late night programs (\"Poker After Dark\" and \"Last Call with Carson Daly\") remained as is, and NBC warned its affiliates not to preempt or delay Leno for local news. After affiliates' fears of significantly lower ratings for local news were in fact realized, NBC announced it would indeed cancel its 10:00\u00a0p.m. experiment and move Leno back to his traditional start time of 11:35 (originally by moving \"The Jay Leno Show\", before rejoining as host of the latter show outright after O'Brien negotiated out of his contract with NBC due to problems over the network's original plan to shift \"Tonight\" a half-hour later to make room for Leno).",

This was McCarthy-Miller's eleventh directed episode. \"Khonani\" originally aired in the United States on April 22, 2010, on NBC as the eighteenth episode of the show's fourth season and the 76th overall episode of the series. The main plot regarding the two janitors\u2014Subhas and Khonani\u2014battling for the late-night shift at 11:30\u00a0p.m. closely mirrored the feud between television hosts Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien over the hosting job of \"The Tonight Show\". Similar to the feud, in this \"30 Rock\" episode, Khonani signed a contract five years ago to take over the 11:30\u00a0p.m. from Subhas and asked Jack Donaghy to make it happen, which Jack does. In September 2004, it was announced by the NBC network that Jay Leno would be succeeded by Conan O'Brien in 2009 as host of \"The Tonight Show\". Five years later, Leno would host his final episode of \"The Tonight Show\" in May 2009; similarly, Jack informs Subhas that Khonani will take over that shift. Subhas is not thrilled with this, resulting in Jack moving Subhas to the 10:00 shift; O'Brien took over as host of \"The Tonight Show\" in June 2009. NBC, afraid of losing Leno to another network, gave him a new nightly prime time series, \"The Jay Leno Show\", which premiered in September 2009 at 10:00\u00a0p.m. In \"Khonani\", as he begins his shift, Khonani is unhappy as there is no trash to pick up as it already has been collected by Subhas. As a result, Subhas goes back to the 11:30 shift, and Khonani leaves NBC to continue his janitorial duties at Foxwoods Resort Casino. \"The Jay Leno Show\" debuted to good ratings, however, as the show continued it would garner low ratings, resulting in NBC proposing that the show air at 11:35\u00a0p.m. and that \"The Tonight Show\" be moved to 12:05. O'Brien, however, rejected the timeslot. In January 2010, O'Brien reached a deal with the network that would see him leave \"The Tonight Show\" on January 22, 2010, and two months later Leno returned as host of \"The Tonight Show\" on March 1, 2010.

            "document": "Television in Japan . While TV programs vary from station to station, some generalizations can be made. Most commercial television stations sign on between the hours of 4:00 AM and 5:00 AM every morning. Early morning hours are dominated by news programs, and these run from around 9:00 to 9:30 AM. They are then replaced by late morning shows that target wives who have finished their housework. These run to around 1:30 PM, at which time reruns of dramas and information programs that target the same age group start. On some stations at 4:00 PM, the young kid-oriented anime and TV shows start, and end around 7:00 PM or 8:00 PM. Evening news programs air as early as before 4:00 PM or before 5:00 PM and end at 7:00 PM, when the \"Golden Hour\" of TV shows start. 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM are the time periods into which TV stations pour the most resources. Appearing in this time slot is a certain sign that an actor or actress is a TV star. After 9:00 they switch over to Japanese television dramas and programs focusing on older age groups, which run till 10:00 or 11:00 PM. Stations run their late night news mostly at the 11:00 PM hour, and around midnight sports news programs run which target working ages. After these, programs for mature audiences run as well as anime that do not expect enough viewers if they were run earlier. Some commercial stations sign off between 2:00 AM and 3:00 AM every night; however, most stations affiliated with NNS or JNN broadcast 24 hours a day, with the sign off window replaced by a simulcast of their networks' news channel during the overnight hours. Other stations do filler programming to fill time before the start of early morning news. Commercial stations sometimes sign off on Sunday late nights or other days for technical maintenance. NHK is required to broadcast 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.",

            "document": "Conan (talk show) . From November 8, 2010 to August 30, 2013, the program aired in Canada on cable channel The Comedy Network on Monday to Thursday nights (Tuesday to Friday mornings) at midnight ET/PT, with a repeat on broadcast network CTV at 1:07\u00a0a.m. local time. The program was only initially announced for CTV, leading to some concern about the unusually late time slot, two hours after its airing in the United States for viewers in the Eastern Time Zone (the program airs on CTV Atlantic at 1:05\u00a0a.m. AT / 12:05\u00a0a.m. ET). This is due to local and national newscasts in the 11:00\u00a0p.m. hour, and CTV's commitments to \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\" at 12:05\u00a0a.m. and \"The Colbert Report\" at 12:35\u00a0a.m. CTV executives later said the program would likely air earlier on The Comedy Network, which is owned by CTV. However, that channel also had a conflict, since it has long aired both \"Daily\" and \"Colbert\" during the 11:00\u00a0p.m. ET hour, simulcasting the Comedy Central feed. The Comedy Network then attempted to move up both programs to 10:00\u00a0p.m. ET beginning in September 2010, presumably to make room for \"Conan\" at 11:00; however, there were intermittent \"technical difficulties\" with getting the shows in time for the earlier airing, particularly for a series of special live \"Daily\" episodes in late October, which meant re-runs were aired in their place. After viewer complaints about the missed episodes, Comedy elected to move both shows back to their previous timeslots, meaning that \"Conan\" was rescheduled on that channel to midnight, on a one-hour delay from TBS. On September 3, 2013, Much Music began broadcasting the program every Monday to Thursday at 11 p.m. ET (8 p.m. Pacific), though it was moved back to its time-delayed midnight airing the following month. The repeat on CTV was moved to 1:37\u00a0a.m. On September 3, 2014, the program began airing on Much at 12:30\u00a0a.m. after \"@midnight\". On January 9, 2017, \"Conan\" began airing at 11 p.m. ET again, only to again be moved back an hour to midnight in April of that same year. \"Conan\" aired on Much until September 1, 2017 and now solely airs on CTV.",

Richter said, \"Now I'm so happy to be back and making TV every night, not asking permission from somebody and waiting six months to get their sparklingly clear and cogent notes.

O'Brien and his staff were both disappointed and furious; when it became clear O'Brien would not agree to the proposed changes, the situation grew heated. Though not a breach of either host's contract, the change resulted in a public outcry and public demonstrations largely in support of O'Brien. O'Brien's public statement that he would \"not participate in the destruction of \"The Tonight Show\"\" led to negotiations with NBC for a settlement. O'Brien and his staff received US$45 million to walk away from the network, with his final \"Tonight Show\" airing January 22, 2010; Leno was reinstated as host that March, while after a contractual seven-month ban on appearing on television, O'Brien moved to TBS to host \"Conan\".",

Before the deal was announced, O'Brien initially had reservations about the move, as it would place comedian George Lopez's show, \"Lopez Tonight\", one hour later to midnight, effectively doing to Lopez what NBC had wanted to do with O'Brien. However, Lopez reportedly called O'Brien and expressed his excitement about the move. Lopez went on to state, \"I can't think of anything better than doing my show with Conan as my lead-in It's the beginning of a new era in late-night comedy.\" In an official press release by Turner Broadcasting, it stated that O'Brien had only begun negotiations a week prior to the official announcement of the show. Steve Koonin, President of Turner Entertainment Networks, went on to comment of the announcement, \"Conan has been the comedic voice for a generation.
