Pope John Paul II emphasizes heavily on protecting a person's dignity in using media, which will require a positive development, that has clear structure, since media not only provide for mere entertainment, but has close connections to all areas of human life, \"i.e. Politics, economy, culture\". There are three \u201cfundamental options\u201d) the Church and her members face today: formation, participation, and dialogue. First, the formation of media has to be closely observed and filtered, such as formation of a new vocabulary used widely in media, then spreading to everyday language. Pope John Paul II notes that without \u201cproper formation,\u201d) the media would no longer be serving humanity, but shaping our beliefs and minds. In this, chiefly the younger generation are the most concerned, who would need critical and responsible education on the use of media(11). Second, a true participation by all members are encouraged, in which the Pope calls for a \u201cculture of co-responsibility,\u201d towards handling of media. Lastly, mass media's role of promoting dialogue and as tool of reciprocal knowledge is highlighted. However, this feature is like a double-edged sword, in that if used for good purpose, it can become the most powerful tool in spreading peace and understandings amongst humanity, or, \u201ca destructive weapon\u201d) if it were to be used in a negative manner. Pope John Paul II refers to his predecessors, who have discussed about such features of media we face today, such as Pius XII. Pius XII recognized the value of public opinion within and towards the Church, which is a strong feature of media communications. Also, according to the Code of Canon Law, everyone has a right to express their opinion. Therefore, John Paul II is telling the readers that his goal of writing such document on media today, isn't aiming for complete control and coercion over the people's mind and opinions. Although the Church must not leave room for arbitrary interpretations of the faith, by no means it is promoting the absolute power of the Church\u2014rather, he notes that the dialogue between the faithful is valued within the Church. John Paul II expands on the promotion of dialogues, yet he notes that although the Church is open to all, there will be times when an \u201cadequate confidentiality\u201d is required for the good of all.",

The impossibility of answering truly the question whether the 100th (or 10,000th) decimal in the evaluation of Pi is or is not a 9, splendidly illustrates how impossible it is to predicate truth in abstraction from actual knowing and actual purpose. For the question cannot be answered until the decimal is calculated. Until then no one knows what it is, or rather will turn out to be. And no one will calculate it, until it serves some purpose to do so, and some one therefore interests himself in the calculation. And so until then the truth remains uncertain: there is no 'true' answer, because there is no actual context in which the question has really been raised. We have merely a number of conflicting possibilities, not even claims to truth, and there is no decision. Yet a decision is possible if an experiment is performed. But his experiment presupposes a desire to know. It will only be made if the point becomes one which it is practically important to decide. Normally no doubt it does not become such, because for the actual purposes of the sciences it makes no difference whether we suppose the figure to be 9 or something else. I.e. the truth to, say, the 99th decimal, is ' true enough ' for our purposes, and the 100th is a matter of indifference. But let that indifference cease, and the question become important, and the ' truth ' will at once become ' useful '. Prof. Taylor's illustration therefore conclusively proves that in an actual context and as an actual question there is no true answer to be got until the truth has become useful. This point is illustrated also by the context Prof. Taylor has himself suggested. For he has made the question about the 100th decimal important by making the refutation of the whole pragmatist theory of knowledge depend on it. And what nobler use could the 100th decimal have in his eyes?

Religion to me is a bureaucracy between man and God that I don't need, but I'm not an atheist, no.\" Maher has also occasionally referred to himself as an apatheist, saying in 2011 \"I don't know what happens when you die, and I don't care.\" When discussing his apatheism and his views on the existence of God, he said on a scale from 1 to 7 (7 being \"absolutely certain there is no god\"), he was only at 6.9, like Richard Dawkins, \"because we just don't know ... but we just don't think about it.\" He added, \"There's atheist and there's agnostic, and I'm okay with us not splitting the difference on those; if you are just not a super-religious person, you are on my team.\" Several months later on a 2012 episode of his HBO show, Maher declared that \"idiots must stop claiming that atheism is a religion. [...] believe it or not, I don't really enjoy talking about religion all the time. In fact, not only is atheism not a religion, it's not even my hobby, and that's the best thing about being an atheist. It requires so little of your time.\" He has reiterated his stance during other interviews, rejecting both the certitude of the existence, as well as the certitude of nonexistence of deities, concluding, \"I'm saying that doubt is the only appropriate response for human beings.\"",

In 1059 the electorate was restricted to the Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, and the individual votes of all Cardinal Electors were made equal in 1179. The electors are now limited to those who have not reached 80 on the day before the death or resignation of a pope. The pope does not need to be a Cardinal Elector or indeed a Cardinal; however, since the pope is the Bishop of Rome, only those who can be ordained a bishop can be elected, which means that any male baptized Catholic is eligible. The last to be elected when not yet a bishop was Pope Gregory XVI in 1831, and the last to be elected when not even a priest was Pope Leo X in 1513, and the last to be elected when not a cardinal was Pope Urban VI in 1378. If someone who is not a bishop is elected, he must be given episcopal ordination before the election is announced to the people.",

Besides the Pope, who has plenary legislative power, there are several other legislative authorities in the Roman Catholic Church with varying degrees of particular legislative power. Primary examples are diocesan bishops and their equivalents, episcopal conferences, and particular councils.

Legislators also can entrust the power to authentically interpret their own laws to someone else. For the 1983 Code of Canon Law, the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, and other papal laws, the pope has delegated the authority to issue authentic interpretations to the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts.

The miracle in question involves the healing of an unborn girl, Amanda Maria Paola (born 25 December 2014), after her parents (Vanna and Alberto) went to the Santuario delle Grazie in Brescia to pray for the late pope's intercession the previous 29 October, just ten days after Paul VI was beatified. The miracle regarding Amanda was the fact that she had survived for months despite the fact that the placenta was broken. On 23 September, a month before the beatification, Amanda's mother Vanna Pironato (aged 35) was hospitalized due to the premature rupture of the placenta, with doctors declaring her pregnancy to be at great risk. The documents regarding the alleged miracle are now in Rome awaiting approval; he shall be canonized should this healing be approved. Theologians advising the Congregation for the Causes of Saints voiced their approval to this miracle on 13 December 2017 (following the confirmation of doctors on 26 October) and have this direction on to the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. who must vote on the cause also before taking it to Pope Francis for his approval. Brescian media reports the canonization could take place in October 2018 to coincide with the synod on the youth. The cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. issued their unanimous approval to this miracle in their meeting held on 6 February 2018; La Stampa reported that the canonization could be celebrated during the synod on the youth with a probable date of 21 October. Pope Francis confirmed that the canonization would be approved and celebrated in 2018 in remarks made during a meeting with Roman priests on 14 February 2018. On 6 March 2018, the Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, speaking at a plenary meeting of the International Catholic Migration Commission in Rome, confirmed that Paul VI would be canonized in at the close of the synod on 28 October 2018. On 6 March, the pope confirmed the healing as a miracle, thereby approving Paul VI's canonization; a consistory of cardinals on 19 May will determine the official date for Paul VI's canonization; it has been scheduled for 14 October 2018.",

Originally, the Diocese of Savannah, therefore, was created from the Diocese of Charleston; and the Diocese of Charleston originated from the Archdiocese of Baltimore, Maryland. Pope Pius XI changed the ecclesiastical territory's name of the Diocese of Savannah to become the conjoined Diocese of Savannah-Atlanta on January 5, 1937, to reflect the growth of Catholicism in the state. The number of Catholics in the northern counties of Georgia had grown so much that Pope Pius XII divided the ecclesiastical territory on July 2, 1956, and created the Diocese of Savannah and the Diocese of Atlanta. At that time, there were also two designated co-cathedrals, including St. John the Baptist in Savannah and Christ the King in Atlanta. (In 1962, the Diocese of Atlanta was elevated to the status of an archdiocese, becoming the center of the ecclesiastical province of the same name.)",

In 1962, Pope John XXIII made it a rule that a man who has been nominated a cardinal is required to be consecrated a bishop, if not one already, but some ask for and obtain dispensation from this requirement.
