The Romantic poets were influenced by all their famous predecessors, when writing sonnets, but the most important single influence was Milton, who had written less than 30 sonnets himself. In the 17th century Milton kept the sonnet form alive while also expanding the subject matter \u2013 which hitherto had mainly been love \u2013 by writing about ideas, events, history, and contemporary issues. Like Milton, the Romantics wrote relatively few love sonnets and the sonnet of the Romantic era include politics, nature, friendship, art, history, religion, life and death. In fact some of the Romantic poets even wrote sonnets about sonnets. Wordsworth\u2019s \"Scorn not the Sonnet\" is an example of this. Keats also wrote about sonnets, most notably in \"On the Sonnet\" (1819), which like Wordsworth's poem defends the form in content and by using it himself.",

In Sonnet 78 we find out about a rival who is male and a poet and whose entry initiates an episode of jealousy that comes to a close in only Sonnet 86 These sonnets are considered to be the Rival Poet sonnets. The rival poet sonnets include three primary players; the fair youth, the rival poet, and the lady who is desired by both men. The identities of these three players have been a controversy for hundreds of years and many experts disagree on the personage of the fair youth, rival poet, and lady.  The author Joseph Pequigney discusses the historic background of the rival poet, fair youth, and lady and states, \"The rival poet referred to in Sonnet 78 to 86, (a) are wholly fictitious, or (b) are depictions of real but unknown persons, or (c) admit of historical identifications. In the case of (c) speculation centers mostly on the youth who is surmised to be either the earl of Southampton or the earl of Pembroke or, occasionally, some other nobleman. Marlowe and Chapman are the leading candidates for the role of the literary rival, the lady has generally fared less well in generating a historical counterpart. Regardless of whether the incidents and interpersonal transactions rendered are actual or imaginary, everything comes through as uncertain or indistinct because the Quarto, unauthorized and unsupervised by Shakespeare, (a) prints the Sonnets in a version to be understood as disarranged to a greater or lesser extent, or (b) the order of the poems in Q must be accepted in lieu of more satisfactory alternative, or (c) the lost original order may be reconstructed by acute transpositions.\" As with the fair youth there is some debate over the personage of the rival poet. Other experts disagree with Pequigney's assessment and another expert stated, \"Among biographically minded commentators, a favourite candidate for Rival Poet has been Christopher Marlowe\".  The author R.J.C. Wait believes that the youth is none other than the Earl of Southampton. Waits states, \"Shakespeare now clearly recognizes that Southampton is giving assistance to one or more rivals\". Another perspective is given by the author Macd. P. Jackson who states, \"There can be no simple equation of a figure in Shakespeare's sonnets with a historical, biological personage.\" Waits argues that there are too many similarities for the fair youth to be anyone other than the Earl of Southampton, who was a known patron of the arts. The controversy around the identities of the fair youth, rival poet(s), and lady are an age old argument and may never be resolved as Shakespeare never explicitly identifies the individuals in the Sonnets.",

There have been many arguments by scholars whether or not the sonnet was written about Shakespeare's disdain with the stage and his career in the theater, or if the sonnet is a confession of love to an unknown young man. Shakespeare's use of the word motley has the mind of critics and scholars boggled as to what the sonnet could truly mean. A motley is a multi-colored gown, or costume, usually worn by a jester. Many scholars believe that the sonnet is written about Shakespeare's disdain with the theater and the actors, or even his own profession as an actor. Katherine Duncan-Jones believes that the sonnet is about Shakespeare's feelings about his own career as an actor. Scholar Henry Reed agrees with Duncan-Jones and believes that the sonnet is written about Shakespeare's own disdain with his acting career. The third line of the quatrain also suggests that the sonnet could be about the theater. Gored could be used in the sense of sewing triangular sized cloths into the motley that would be worn by the actor. However, there are other scholars that would disagree with the two. Among these scholars is Kenneth Muir who says, \"the theatrical image does not imply that he was referring to his job as an actor.\" According to Virginia Radley and David Redding, the interpretation of the sonnet being about Shakespeare's profession as an actor is wrong. Radley and Redding suggests that \"sonnet 110 has nothing to do with the stage, or the acting, or the play writing.\" Radley and Redding interpreted the first quatrain as the poets confession of promiscuity. Lines 1-2 suggests that the poet has been around and has made a fool of himself for the world to see. Here, the word motley is used as in \"I played the fool.\" Line 3 suggests that the poet put himself on display and gave away his precious love. With the use of the word gored, Radley and Redding translated the phrase \"gored mine own thoughts\" to \"wounded my best thoughts\". The last line of this quatrain uses the word offences is used in the correct term as in offending the poet's lover by this new affairs he has encountered.

Landry acknowledges the sonnet \"has the grandeur of generality or a 'universal significance',\" but cautions that \"however timeless and universal its implications may be, we must never forget that Sonnet 116 has a restricted or particular range of meaning simply because it does not stand alone.\" Carol Thomas Neely writes that, \"Sonnet 116 is part of a sequence which is separate from all the other sonnets of Shakespeare because of their sense of detachment. They aren't about the action of love and the object of that love is removed in this sequence which consists of Sonnets 94, 116, and 129\". This group of three sonnets does not fit the mold of the rest of Shakespeare's sonnets, therefore, and they defy the typical concept and give a different perspective of what love is and how it is portrayed or experienced. \"Though 116 resolves no issues, the poet in this part of the sequence acknowledges and accepts the fallibility of his love more fully than he could acknowledge that of the young man's earlier\". Other critics of Sonnet 116 have argued that one cannot rely on the context of the sonnet to understand its tone. They argue that since \"there is no indisputably authoritative sequence to them, we cannot make use of context as positive evidence for one kind of tone or another.\" Shakespeare does not attempt to come to any significant conclusion within this particular sonnet because no resolution is needed.",

While unmetered or only loosely metered, Hilbert\u2019s sonnets observe the boundaries of the little room of the sonnet marked by the rhyme scheme quite carefully.\" Critic Maryann Corbett has written in \"Rattle (magazine)\" that \u201cHilbert has made the limits tight in a new way. He\u2019s created his own Houdini-like set of chains to wriggle out of: a new form that\u2019s already known as the Hilbertian sonnet, with the rhyme scheme abc abc def def gg. It\u2019s a form designed to grate against the expectations of the reader who is geared to the usual foursquare quatrains in the octaves of the Petrarchan and Shakespearian sonnet forms. It also cuts across the squared grain of some of the poet\u2019s arguments . . . Bucking our expectation of quatrains is a way of allowing rhyme to be present but not foregrounded. Even for a master and great proponent of form as Hilbert, that strategy might be necessary in the current climate of smiling intolerance for rhyme. . . . Bucking our expectation of rhyme is also simply a way of keeping readers off balance, keeping them un-lulled by regularity of sonics. As to the location of the volta, or turn, again we don\u2019t know what to expect; the novel form upsets our habit of looking for a turn after the octave. Sometimes there is one, sometimes it\u2019s elsewhere, sometimes it\u2019s absent. Hilbert bucks our metrical expectations too: he writes mostly ten-syllable lines, but refuses to let too many of them fall into the expected iambic pattern. No amount of looseness or \u2018breathability\u2019 will make them iambic; it\u2019s not in their design to let us settle into a pattern.\u201d Critic and classical scholar Chris Childers wrote in \"The Hopkins Review\" that \u201cthe structural units of Hilbert\u2019s sonnets fall outside the usual parameters of octave-sestet . . . allowing Hilbert to put the conventional volta (or turn) anywhere or nowhere. The effect is to de-formulaicize and de-familiarize the sonnet\u2019s traditional rhetorical shape, shifting the weight of emphasis off of argument and onto imagery and voice, an effect to which the distant mutedness of the rhymes also contributes.\u201d",

The rival poet sonnets include three primary players; the fair youth, the rival poet, and the lady who is desired by both men. The identities of these three players have been a controversy for hundreds of years and many experts disagree on the personage of the fair youth, rival poet, and lady.  The author Joseph Pequigney discusses the historic background of the rival poet, fair youth, and lady and states, \"The rival poet referred to in Sonnet 78 to 86, (a) are wholly fictitious, or (b) are depictions of real but unknown persons, or (c) admit of historical identifications. In the case of (c) speculation centers mostly on the youth who is surmised to be either the earl of Southampton or the earl of Pembroke or, occasionally, some other nobleman. Marlowe and Chapman are the leading candidates for the role of the literary rival, the lady has generally fared less well in generating a historical counterpart. Regardless of whether the incidents and interpersonal transactions rendered are actual or imaginary, everything comes through as uncertain or indistinct because the Quarto, unauthorized and unsupervised by Shakespeare, (a) prints the Sonnets in a version to be understood as disarranged to a greater or lesser extent, or (b) the order of the poems in Q must be accepted in lieu of more satisfactory alternative, or (c) the lost original order may be reconstructed by acute transpositions.\" As with the fair youth there is some debate over the personage of the rival poet. Other experts disagree with Pequigney's assessment and another expert stated, \"Among biographically minded commentators, a favourite candidate for Rival Poet has been Christopher Marlowe\".  The author R.J.C. Wait believes that the youth is none other than the Earl of Southampton. Waits states, \"Shakespeare now clearly recognizes that Southampton is giving assistance to one or more rivals\". Another perspective is given by the author Macd. P. Jackson who states, \"There can be no simple equation of a figure in Shakespeare's sonnets with a historical, biological personage.\" Waits argues that there are too many similarities for the fair youth to be anyone other than the Earl of Southampton, who was a known patron of the arts.

This is disturbing because the subject in the sonnet is one that the persona has found erotically profitable, in part because the other poet may be superior in learning and style. Shakespeare is not concerned with poetic triumph he is vying only for the prize of a fair friend. The combat between the two rivals is indirect and the speaker never addresses his literary adversary and only mentions his beloved. It is the body language of Sonnet 78 (the first in the series) 79, 80 and 84 that serves to convert the topic of letters into that of eroticism. Shakespeare is known for his usage of puns and double meaning on words. So it isn't surprising that he uses wordplay in the first quatrain on \"pen\" for the male appendage, or, as a Stein-cum-Joyce might say, \"a pen is a penis a pen,\" is fully utilized.

            "document": "Sonnet 138 . Sonnet 138 is a part of a series of poems written about Shakespeare's dark lady. They describe a woman who has dark hair and dark eyes. She diverges from the Petrarchan norm. \"Golden locks\" and \"florid cheeks\" were fashionable in that day, but Shakespeare's lady does not bear those traits. The lady is shown as being both fair and foul, and both kind and unkind. Alice F. Moore feels that within these later sonnets the poet is equally as dark as the lady. As the speaker reveals the mistress in her \"foulness\" and \"deceit\", he consequently reveals himself. These sonnets are shadowed by the speakers own self-hatred and anger. However, Joel Fineman believes that the biggest difference between series of the dark lady and the other series of sonnets featuring the young man is that those about the dark lady use a formula of lusty misogyny that is clearly Shakespearean. Throughout the sonnets, and especially sonnet 138, the lady \"comes to occupy this peculiarly charged erotic place (\"therefore I lie with her, and she with me,/And in our faults by lies we flattered be\"). The sonnets addressed to the dark lady usually relate the lady with \"a disjunction occasioned by verbal duplicity,\" (\"When my love swears that she is made of truth,/I do believe her, though I know she lies\"). The language in the dark lady sonnets is some that \"one is forced to hear-- to hear, that is, as language-- functions as a supplementary and confirming, not a disavowing, gloss on what the poet has to say\". They \"conceal praise under the guise of disparagement (Kambascovic-Sawers p. 293). A.L. Rowse believes that the sonnet takes us further into Shakespeare's relationship with the lady. The relationship is both \"purely sexual\" and \"utterly unromantic\". However, it can also be said that the speaker is not attracted to the woman because of her \"physical, intellectual, or moral excellence\". Instead, the attraction is portrayed as being \"self-generated, with no basis in 'reality'. Rowse feels that the woman discussed in the sonnet can be identified as the mistress, Emilia. Shakespeare is six years older, and is thus highly conscious of his age. Underneath all the hyprocrisies there is Shakespeare's \"honest candour.\" In \"Shakespeare's Sonnets: The Problems Solved\", A. L. Rowse notes that Sonnet 138 shows the \"uncompromising realism with which he [Shakespeare] describes it all: it has been said -- rightly-- that there is no woman like Shakespeare's in all the sonnet-literature of the Renaissance. Most of them are abstractions or wraiths; this one is of flesh and blood\".",

The identities of these two characters are still in question but modern scholars tend to focus more on the sexual eroticism and implication of homosexuality in the Sonnets: \"The reality of the poet's purported bisexual identity now figuring more prominently than any speculation about real figures with whom Shakespeare might have actually been involved, amorously or otherwise.\" On the other hand, there are critics who view Shakespeare's relationship with the young boy as a friendship rather than romantic love. This is the view that K.D. Sethna holds: \"The problem, of course, is the two main characters round whom Shakespeare's Sonnets exult and agonize with a passionate quixotism of friendship and a frantic fever of love- or, as G. Wilson Knight sums up in the current jargon, \"homosexual idealism and heterosexual lust.'\" John Berryman, on the other hand, understands the first line of Sonnet 144 to be Shakespeare's way of confessing his romantic relationship with the boy and the dark lady: \"This is the sonnet of which the poet John Berryman remarked, in his comments on Lowell in The Freedom of the Poet, 'When Shakespeare wrote [\"Two lovers I have\"] reader, he was not kidding.\" Helen Vendler agrees with Berryman's analysis: \"Sonnet 144 has an air of confession.\" If evaluated through queer hermeneutics, Sonnet 144 can appear to have homoerotic overtones. For example, Oscar Wilde's \"The Portrait of Mr. W.H.\" is a critical analysis of Shakespeare's Sonnets that emphasizes their potential homoeroticism. Wilde believed in the theory that the young man addressed in the sonnets was an actor in Shakespeare's troupe named Willie Hughes. The sonnets are thus a love letter from Shakespeare to Willie Hughes. Wilde writes, \"[Shakespeare] finds that what his tongue had spoken his soul had listened to, and that the raiment that he had put on for the disguise is a plague-stricken and poisonous thing that eats into his flesh, and that he cannot throw away. Then comes Desire, with its many maladies, and Lust that makes one love all that one loathes, and Shame, with its ashen face and secret smile.\" Wilde writes of Shakespeare's mental and emotional battle of whom to love and how to love that person. Wilde writes specifically of Sonnet 144, \"[Shakespeare] has his moments of loathing for her [the Dark Lady], for, not content with enslaving the soul of Shakespeare, she seems to have sought to snare the senses of Willie Hughes.\" In Sonnet 144, the second quatrain is full of dislike toward the Dark Lady, \"To win me soon to hell, my female evil / \u2026 / and would corrupt my saint to be a devil.\"  However, Wilde recognizes that the Willie Hughes theory is that, just a theory. One will never know what Shakespeare was thinking when he was completing the sonnets. \"Shakespeare's heart is still to us a 'a closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes,' as he calls it in one of the sonnets. We shall never know the true secret of the passion of his life.\" C.B. Cox writes, \"In Elizabethan times the crime of buggery was punishable by death. Today this legal term for homosexual intercourse offends our ears, but its use draws attention to the abhorrence with which many Christians of the time (and since) regarded physical intimacies between men. In these circumstances it's difficult to believe that Shakespeare would not only participate in an active homosexual relation with a handsome young man, but broadcast this affair to the world in sexually explicit sonnets pass round among his friends.\" The competing view of a bisexual Shakespeare conflicts with Wilde's view. Cox bases his argument on the verb \"to have.\" He argues that why must the verb usage of \"to have\" mean sexually possess? Elizabethan people had trouble believing \"had\" meant to have sexually when it came to the young man, but Cox writes, \"It's difficult to refute Pequiney's contention that in these three examples (Sonnet 52, Sonnet 75, and Sonnet 87) there is a sexual innuendo in \"had,\" particularly when in Sonnet 129, which concerns heterosexual love for the Dark Lady, everyone agrees that there is such an implication. Elizabethan society feared homosexual desire, but embraced heterosexual conquests. Cox writes, \"The poems may be based on personal experience but still that doesn't actually prove that Shakespeare 'had' the youth. There's an element of playfulness in the sexual innuendoes, a delight in wit as if Shakespeare is enjoying his own virtuosity and may not have expected to be taken literally... In his poems to the youth he may be using sexual innuendo as a kind of joke, a playful but at times almost serious hint that his affection may even extend to physical desire.\"",

There have been many arguments by scholars whether or not the sonnet was written about Shakespeare's disdain with the stage and his career in the theater, or if the sonnet is a confession of love to an unknown young man. Shakespeare's use of the word motley has the mind of critics and scholars boggled as to what the sonnet could truly mean. A motley is a multi-colored gown, or costume, usually worn by a jester. Many scholars believe that the sonnet is written about Shakespeare's disdain with the theater and the actors, or even his own profession as an actor. Katherine Duncan-Jones believes that the sonnet is about Shakespeare's feelings about his own career as an actor. Scholar Henry Reed agrees with Duncan-Jones and believes that the sonnet is written about Shakespeare's own disdain with his acting career. The third line of the quatrain also suggests that the sonnet could be about the theater. Gored could be used in the sense of sewing triangular sized cloths into the motley that would be worn by the actor. However, there are other scholars that would disagree with the two. Among these scholars is Kenneth Muir who says, \"the theatrical image does not imply that he was referring to his job as an actor.\" According to Virginia Radley and David Redding, the interpretation of the sonnet being about Shakespeare's profession as an actor is wrong. Radley and Redding suggests that \"sonnet 110 has nothing to do with the stage, or the acting, or the play writing.\" Radley and Redding interpreted the first quatrain as the poets confession of promiscuity. Lines 1-2 suggests that the poet has been around and has made a fool of himself for the world to see. Here, the word motley is used as in \"I played the fool.\" Line 3 suggests that the poet put himself on display and gave away his precious love. With the use of the word gored, Radley and Redding translated the phrase \"gored mine own thoughts\" to \"wounded my best thoughts\". The last line of this quatrain uses the word offences is used in the correct term as in offending the poet's lover by this new affairs he has encountered. By the end of this quatrain, the reading of the sonnet slowly becomes clear that this a confession of love versus Shakespeare's disdain with the theater.",

            "document": "Sonnet 78 . Shakespeare likes to play with his words. This is especially evident in Sonnet 78. As Michael Schoenfeldt noted, \"the more whimsical complimentary sonnets, such as 78\u2026 such sonnets may be fanciful, but they are not frivolous\u2026 Read from the right angle, so to speak, they can be very beautiful, or at least delightful; and in them, as elsewhere Shakespeare is inventing some game or other and playing it out to its conclusion in deft and surprising ways. The words \"pen\", \"feather\", and \"style\" \u2014 used in stanza 1, 2, and 3 respectively \u2014 seem to be related. The word pen comes from the Latin word penna meaning feather. The word style is derived from the Latin stilus meaning a writing instrument. All three of these words have associations to the literary craft. The \"dumb\", \"ignorance\", \"learned\", and \"grace\" are nouns that occur in the second stanza. The words dumb and ignorance relate to the character of the poet as compared to his rivals, while \"learned\" and \"grace\" are qualities that describe his rivals. In line 7, the poet uses a \"metaphor from falconry and refers to the practice of imping, engrafting extra feathers in the wing of a bird\" in order to improve the health and flight of the bird. There are Italian allusions in Sonnet 78. For example, the phrase \"\"penna d'ingegno\"\" in Petrarch's sonnet 307, which means \u201cpen of genius\u201d, is analogous to Shakespeare's phrase \u201clearned's wing\u201d. The reference to falconry is often noted, but not the reference to Petrarch's sonnet. In line 10, where the poets speaks of something of \"whose influence is thine\" and is \"born of thee\", he uses a reproductive metaphor. Both of these refer to a parental influences on bringing up a child. In keeping with the theme for this sonnet, this child is the poem, and the parent or creator, is the fair youth. In line 12's \"grace\" and \"graced\", Shakespeare uses a stylistic device known as polyptoton \u2013 the use of two words that share the same root. He does this to emphasize the idea found in line 8 \u2013 where the word \"grace\" is used to imply the power the muse has on the poet. In line 13's phrase \"thou art all my art\" Shakespeare uses a rhetorical device known as antanaclasis, in which a word is used twice in different senses. This use of the same words reemphasizes the claim of the poem that \"the beloved's being and the speaker's art are one and the same thing\". Joel Fineman has another perspective on this well known phrase. He says, \"Instead of 'thou art all my art', writing itself stands \u2014 not subtly, but explictiy \u2014between the poet's first and second persons. Writing itself (the same writing written by \"I\" the poet and by the \"thou\" of the young man) gives the poet an ontological and poetic art of interference whose transference both is and is not what it is supposed to be\"",

His mistress, says the poet, is nothing like this conventional image, but is as lovely as any woman\". Here, Barbara Mowat offers her opinion of the meaning behind Sonnet 130; this work breaks the mold to which Sonnets had come to conform. Shakespeare composed a sonnet which seems to parody a great many sonnets of the time. Poets like Thomas Watson, Michael Drayton, and Barnabe Barnes were all part of this sonnet craze and each wrote sonnets proclaiming love for an almost unimaginable figure; Patrick Crutwell posits that Sonnet 130 could actually be a satire of the Thomas Watson poem \"Passionate Century of Love\", pointing out that the Watson poem contains all but one of the platitudes that Shakespeare is making fun of in Sonnet 130. However, E.G. Rogers points out the similarities between Watson's \"Passionate Century of Love,\" Sonnet 130, and Richard Linche's Poem collection entitled \"Diella.\" There is a great deal of similarity between sections of the Diella poem collection and Shakespeare's \"Sonnet 130\", for example in \"130\" we see, \"If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head,\" where in \"Diella\" we see \"Her hayre exceeds fold forced in the smallest wire.\" Each work uses a comparison of hairs to wires; while in modern sense this may seem unflattering, one could argue that Linche's work draws upon the beauty of weaving gold and that Shakespeare mocks this with harsh comparison. This, along with other similarities in textual content, leads, as E.G. Rogers points out, the critic to believe that Diella may have been the source of inspiration for both homage, by Watson's \"Passionate Century of Love,\" and satire by Shakespeare's \"Sonnet 130.\" The idea of Satire is further enforced by the final couplet of \"130\" in which the speaker delivers his most expositional line: \"And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare, as any she belied with false compare.\" This line projects the message behind this work, demeaning the false comparisons made by many poets of the time.",
