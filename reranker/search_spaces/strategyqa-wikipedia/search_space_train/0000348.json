Among the simple solutions, the \"combined doors solution\" comes closest to a conditional solution, as we saw in the discussion of approaches using the concept of odds and Bayes theorem.

But, knowing that the host can open one of the two unchosen doors to show a goat does not mean that opening a specific door would not affect the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen door. The point is, though we know in advance that the host will open a door and reveal a goat, we do not know \"which\" door he will open. If the host chooses uniformly at random between doors hiding a goat (as is the case in the standard interpretation), this probability indeed remains unchanged, but if the host can choose non-randomly between such doors, then the specific door that the host opens reveals additional information. The host can always open a door revealing a goat \"and\" (in the standard interpretation of the problem) the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen door does not change, but it is \"not because\" of the former that the latter is true. Solutions based on the assertion that the host's actions cannot affect the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen appear persuasive, but the assertion is simply untrue unless each of the host's two choices are equally likely, if he has a choice (Falk 1992:207,213).

The psalmist would then say that God made man that way, and because of this \u2018there is nothing wrong with it\u2019 and that \u2018everything God makes is good; therefore there is nothing wrong with it\u2019. The Greeks, as King informs us, \u2018felt the body was evil\u2019 and that the \u2018soul could never reach its full maturity until it broke loose from the prison of the body\u2019. However, Christianity raises the view that \u2018the body is not the principle of evil; it says the will is the principle of evil\u2019. He then defines that in \u2018any doctrine of man, we must be concerned with man's physical well being\u2019. To support this he brings up Jesus` quote that we need the \u201cbread\u201d to survive and also states \u2018this isn\u2019t the only part\u2019 and if we stop here we would see \u2018man merely as an animal\u2019. He then brings an example of chemists who calculated that the values of man came to \u2018about ninety-eight cents\u2019, today with our living standards it comes to \u2018a dollar ninety eight for the average man\u2019. King challenges this idea by questioning \u2018But can we explain the whole of man in terms of ninety eight cents?\u2019 and brings up examples of human genius; and again asks \u2018Can we explain the mystery of the human soul in terms of ninety eight cents?\u2019 To this he answers \u201cno\u201d and states that \u2018man is a child of God\u2019 and raises the second basic point of the doctrine \u2018that man is a being of spirit\u2019, which is the \u2018thou has crowned him with glory and honour\u2019, and because of our \u2018rational capacity, man has a mind, man can reason. This distinguishes us from the lower animals\u2019. King then defines man as \u2018God\u2019s marvellous creation. Through his mind he can leap oceans, break through walls, and transcend the categories of time and space\u2019. With this he defines what the biblical writers meant when they said \u2018man is made in the image of God\u2019, and that he has \u2018rational capacity; he has the unique ability to have a fellowship with God.

Since the argument is very long and has many parts, we shall content ourselves in this article with stating the premises for the existence of the first efficient cause, assuming that the reader will follow the citations to read the rest of the argument. The proof for the conclusion that \"some efficient cause is simply first such that neither can it be an effect nor can it, by virtue of something other than itself, cause an effect\" \"Ordinatio\" I.2.43 runs something like this:1) Something can be produced.2) It is produced either by itself, nothing, or another.3) Not by nothing, for nothing causes nothing.4) Not by itself, for an effect never causes itself.5) Therefore, by another; call it \"A\".6) If \"A\" is first, then we have reached the conclusion.7) If \"A\" is not first, but also an effect, we return to 2). \"A\" is produced either by itself, nothing, or another. 8) From 3) and 4), we say another, \"B\". The ascending series will either continue infinitely or we finally reach something which has nothing prior to it.9) An infinite ascending series is impossible.10) Therefore, etc.Scotus acknowledges two objections and deals with them accordingly. First is that he begs the question in assuming a first in the series. Here he argues that while many admit an infinite regress in an accidentally ordered series of causes, no philosopher admits infinite regress in an essentially ordered series. Scotus explains the differences between the two and offers proofs for the conclusion that an infinity of essentially ordered causes in a series is impossible. Second, it is objected that his proof is not really a demonstration since it begins with a contingent premise. That something is produced is contingent and not necessary. Therefore, the proof proceeds from a contingent and not a necessary premise. Scotus says that while that is true, it is utterly manifest that things are produced or effected. But in order to respond, Scotus makes a modal move and reworks the argument. Now he argues from the possibility of production. \"It is possible that something can be produced\" is a necessary proposition. From there he is able to conclude that it is possible that the first efficient cause exists, and if it is possible that it exists, then it does exist. He assures us that the last claim will be proved later in the argument. In the \"Lectura\" proof, Scotus argues the following way: More can and should be said about this fascinating argument, but we leave it to the reader to search out more of the argument.

We cannot measure all the people in the global population, so instead we sample only a tiny part of it, and measure that. Assume the sample is of size N; that is, we measure the heights of N individuals. From that single sample, only one estimate of the mean can be obtained. In order to reason about the population, we need some sense of the variability of the mean that we have computed. The simplest bootstrap method involves taking the original data set of N heights, and, using a computer, sampling from it to form a new sample (called a 'resample' or bootstrap sample) that is also of size N. The bootstrap sample is taken from the original by using sampling with replacement (e.g. we might 'resample' 5 times from [1,2,3,4,5] and get [2,5,4,4,1]), so, assuming N is sufficiently large, for all practical purposes there is virtually zero probability that it will be identical to the original \"real\" sample. This process is repeated a large number of times (typically 1,000 or 10,000 times), and for each of these bootstrap samples we compute its mean (each of these are called bootstrap estimates). We now can create a histogram of bootstrap means. This histogram provides an estimate of the shape of the distribution of the sample mean from which we can answer questions about how much the mean varies across samples.

This is done by taking persons A, C, & D: C+A+B+A = 8+1+5+1=15. (Here we use A because we know that using A to cross both C and D separately is the most efficient.) But, the time has elapsed and person A and B are still on the starting side of the bridge and must cross. So it is not possible for the two slowest (C & D) to cross separately. Second, we show that in order for C and D to cross together that they need to cross on the second pair-cross: i.e. not C or D, so A and B, must cross together first. Remember our assumption at the beginning states that we should minimize crosses and so we have five crosses - 3 pair-crossings and 2 single crossings. Assume that C and D cross first. But then C or D must cross back to bring the torch to the other side, and so whoever solo-crossed must cross again. Hence, they will cross separately.

So, since there are only three choices for the pair-crossings and C and D cannot cross first or last, they must cross together on the second, or middle, pair-crossing.

Then, A must cross next, since we assume we should choose the fastest to make the solo-cross. Then we are at the second, or middle, pair-crossing so C and D must go.

Man is a free being made in the image of God\u2019. Man also has the ability to \u2018choose between alternatives, so he can choose the good or the evil, the high or the low\u2019. King then admits that \u2018man has misused his freedom\u2019 and concludes that \u2018man is a sinner in need of God\u2019s divine grace\u2019. King also admits that we find excuses to avoid this reality, \u2018we say that man\u2019s misdeeds are due to a conflict between the Id and the superego\u2019. He then states the conflict is \u2018between God and man\u2019, and that we want to cry with St. Augustine, \u201cLord, make me pure, but not yet\u201d. This then leads King to argue that \u2018the \u201cisness\u201d of our present nature is out of harmony with the \u201coughtness\u201d that forever confronts us\u2019 with this \u2018we know how to love, and yet we hate. We take the precious lives that God has given us and throw them away in riotous living.' He then compares us to \u2018sheep (who) have gone astray.\u2019 With this line of thought he concludes with \u2018we are all sinners in need of God\u2019s divine grace\u2019. He then looks at history and sees \u2018how we treat each other. Races trample over other races; nations trample over other nations. We go to war and destroy the values and lives that God has given us.\u2019 With this he realises that \u2018man isn\u2019t made for that\u2019 and \u2018we were made for eternity\u2019. The example of the \u201cprodigal son\u201d is then used to describe our relationship with God, believing that God will forgive us if we ask for it, \u2018man is not made for the far country of evil\u2026decided to rise up\u2026I still love you\u2019.",

            "document": "Analysis of algorithms . Exact (not asymptotic) measures of efficiency can sometimes be computed but they usually require certain assumptions concerning the particular implementation of the algorithm, called model of computation. A model of computation may be defined in terms of an abstract computer, e.g., Turing machine, and/or by postulating that certain operations are executed in unit time. For example, if the sorted list to which we apply binary search has \"n\" elements, and we can guarantee that each lookup of an element in the list can be done in unit time, then at most log \"n\" + 1 time units are needed to return an answer. Time efficiency estimates depend on what we define to be a step. For the analysis to correspond usefully to the actual execution time, the time required to perform a step must be guaranteed to be bounded above by a constant. One must be careful here; for instance, some analyses count an addition of two numbers as one step. This assumption may not be warranted in certain contexts. For example, if the numbers involved in a computation may be arbitrarily large, the time required by a single addition can no longer be assumed to be constant.",

Eric writes that \"there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs.

As we need to perform another nested binary search through O(log \"n\") chains to actually determine the point location, the query time is O(log\u00b2 n).

If, in the above, the numbers are assumed to be measurements (and therefore probably inexact) then \"8\" above represents an inexact measurement with only one significant digit. Therefore, the result of \"8 \u00d7 8\" is rounded to a result with only one significant digit, i.e., \"6 \u00d7 10\" instead of the unrounded \"64\" that one might expect. In many cases, the rounded result is less accurate than the non-rounded result; a measurement of \"8\" has an actual underlying quantity between 7.5 and 8.5. The true square would be in the range between 56.25 and 72.25. So 6 \u00d7 10 is the best one can give, as other possible answers give a false sense of accuracy. Further, the 6 \u00d7 10 is itself confusing (as it might be considered to imply 60 \u00b15, which is over-optimistic; more accurate would be 64 \u00b18).",

But he proposes an ingenious method to tackle the question: just as we can come to know the properties and operations of something through scientific demonstration, i.e. a geometrical proof that a triangle has its interior angles equal to two right angles, since the principle of all scientific demonstration is the essence of the object, so too we can come to know the nature of a thing if we already know its properties and operations. It is like finding the middle term to a syllogism with a known conclusion. Therefore, we must seek out such operations of the soul to determine what kind of nature it has. From a consideration of the opinions of his predecessors, a soul, he concludes, will be that in virtue of which living things have life.",

At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086 the tenant-in-chief of the manor was Archbishop Lanfranc, a stern and very capable man, rivalling the King himself in statesmanship, who had been appointed to the see of Canterbury in 1070 after the Conquest. He held it by frankalmoin. Domesday Book records that the manor was assessed at 30 hides and that there was land there for 14 ploughs. Of these the lord's demesne accounted for 16 hides and 2 ploughs. There were 32 villeins and 8 cottagers and they had 12 ploughs. There were also 4 slaves. These would be only the male heads of families (except for slaves who may have been counted as individuals) and the total has to be multiplied by an arbitrary figure (4 or 5 is usual) for an estimate of the total including women and children. We can therefore assume that the total population was something less than 200 in 1086. There was meadow for 4 plough teams and woodland sufficient for 300 pigs. The value was stated to be \u00a316 in 1086 and also in the time of Edward the Confessor but only \u00a35 immediately after the conquest in 1066.
