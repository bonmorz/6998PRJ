For example, we cannot say that God \"exists\" in the usual sense of the term, because that term is human defined and God's qualities such as existence may not be accurately characterized by it. What we can safely say is that it cannot be proven empirically or otherwise that God is existent, therefore \"God is not non-existent\".

So we cannot use the word \"wise\" to describe God, because this implies God is wise in the way we usually describe humans being wise. However we can safely say that \"God is not ignorant\". We should not say that God is One, because we may not truly understand Gods nature, but we can state that there is no multiplicity in God's being.

For a casual observer the Church is just a social reality \u2013 an association of human beings who profess a common faith, who participate in a common worship and who endeavour to live by a common ethical code. But for believing Christians the Church is also a faith reality. There is a grace-filled depth to the Church. In the Apostles\u2019 Creed we profess: \"We believe in the holy Catholic Church.\" It is the faith understanding of the Church that will be articulated here.  The Church is not a purely human enterprise. God is at work in the origin and development of the Church. That is what we Christians believe. St. Paul speaks of \"the Church of God that is at Corinth\" (1 Cor. 1:2). This probably refers to the local Christian community there. In The Bible \"the Church of the living God\" most likely denotes the entire world-wide assembly of the followers of Jesus Christ. The Second Vatican Council (1962\u201365) spoke of the mystery of the Church. The Church is a mystery because it is part of God\u2019s plan of salvation. In the New Testament, particularly in the Letters of Paul, mystery refers to the divine design for the salvation of humankind. It was God\u2019s plan to offer to everyone the possibility of salvation and to assemble in the Church all those who would believe in his Son. When we say that the Church is a mystery we not only mean that the Church is part of God\u2019s plan of salvation for humankind but also that God is at all times present and active in the Church. As Pope Paul VI stated: \"The Church is a mystery. It is a reality imbued with the hidden presence of God.\". The expression, the Church of God, also signifies a Church that is rooted in the experience of God. Just as Israel originated in the experience of the liberating God in Exodus, so too the Christian Church sprang up from the experience of the saving God in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. One becomes a member of the Church by sharing this experience. Against this background we can see how significant it is that in Ecclesia in Asia Pope John Paul II exhorts the Church to be ever more deeply \"rooted in the experience of God which flows from a living faith.\" Only then can the Church fulfil its vocation to be a meeting place of God and human beings. As the Pope declares: \"The Church cannot therefore be understood merely as a social organization or agency of human welfare. Despite having sinful men and women in her midst, the Church must be seen as the privileged place of encounter between God and human beings, in which God chooses to reveal the mystery of his inner life and carry out his plan of salvation for the world.\"",

In a follow up article, \"Talking About God\", Goldblatt teases out the ramifications of his conclusion about the impossibility of an actual infinity with respect to the concept of an infinite God.

It cannot have come into existence without an efficient cause (since that would violate the law of causality, one of the basic laws of thought). That First Cause, Goldblatt states, following the Cosmological Argument of Thomas Aquinas, is what all men call God. But this realization leads to a paradox. On the one hand, it would seem God cannot be infinite either since an actual infinity is impossible. On the other hand, God cannot have come into existence since that would require a cause prior to the First Cause and lead to an infinite regress of causes . . . which, in turn, would comprise an actual infinity (which cannot be). Therefore, we must suppose an infinite God as the First Cause of the world\u2014even though an actual infinity violates the laws of thought. But whatever violates the laws of thought cannot be subject to rational language; it cannot be said to exist any more than a sentient stone (i.e. a sentient non-sentient being) can be said to exist. (At the moment a stone becomes sentient, in other words, it ceases to be a stone.)

Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.",

The issue of \"The Tablet\" (owned by the future Cardinal Vaughan) for 5 December 1874 stated \"It is true that St. PETER never used the deposing power, but that was because Christendom had not yet begun to exist ; it is equally true that neither Pius IX., nor any of his successors, are ever likely to use it, but that is because Christendom has ceased to exist ... But if Christendom should ever be restored, which does not seem likely, we profess our unhesitating conviction that the deposing power of GOD'S Vicar would revive with it.\" The issue of the same publication for 12 December 1874 contained a letter from Charles Langdale (born 1822) stating 'In common with many of my contemporaries I have, more than once, taken the Catholic oath, a portion of which runs as follows :\u2014\" And I do further declare that it is not an article of my Faith . . . that Princes excommunicated or deprived by the Pope, or any other authority of the See of Rome, may be deposed or murdered by their subjects, or by any person whatsoever ; and I do declare that I do not believe the Pope of Rome . . . hath, or ought to have, any temporal or civil jurisdiction, power, superiority, or preeminence, directly or indirectly, within this realm. . . . \" I cannot, therefore, agree with the writer of the article in question, when he says, \"we (Catholics) firmly believe that the Deposing Power . . . is manifestly included among the gifts of Peter.\" ' In the issue of the same publication for 19 December 1874, 'The Writer of the Article' wrote: 'Mr. Langdale \"regrets\" my observations on the Deposing Power because he and others have taken an oath that they do not believe it. We have, therefore, on one side, the Popes who actually used this power, the Christian nations who obeyed, and the great theologians who justified it ; and, on the other, Mr. Langdale's oath. This hardly seems to constitute an equation. It is all on one side, and nothing on the other.'",

Hegel agrees with Kierkegaard that both reality and humans are incomplete, inasmuch as we are in time, and reality develops through time. But the relation between time and eternity is outside time and this is the \"logical structure\" that Hegel thinks we can know. Kierkegaard disputes this assertion, because it eliminates the clear distinction between ontology and epistemology. Existence and thought are not identical and one cannot possibly think existence. Thought is always a form of abstraction, and thus not only is pure existence impossible to think, but all forms in existence are unthinkable; thought depends on language, which merely abstracts from experience, thus separating us from lived experience and the living essence of all beings. In addition, because we are finite beings, we cannot possibly know or understand anything that is universal or infinite such as God, so we cannot know God exists, since that which transcends time simultaneously transcends human understanding.",

            "document": "Religious views of Jos\u00e9 Rizal . Based on the letters Dr. Rizal wrote, it can be said that his concept of God could be summarized into three (3) notions. First, he believed that God existed. Second, he believed that God was \"Plus Supra\". Lastly, he believed that God was the origin of nature; that is, nature was the expression of God. As regards the first notion, Dr. Rizal made explicit that he believed that God existed. He was convinced that a supernatural power behind all of creation had to exist. He says to Fr. Pastells, \"We are entirely in accord in admitting the existence of God: how can I doubt it when I am convinced of my own existence? Who recognizes the effect recognizes the cause.\" It was clear that Dr. Rizal subscribed to the idea of \"necessary-contingent beings\" where the contingent being needed other beings for it to exist while the necessary being existed on its own. As such, the necessary being becomes the origin of contingent beings. This necessary being has been labelled by many as \"God.\" Dr. Rizal considered himself as a contingent being that needed other beings to sustain his existence. Such other beings included the origin of all; the necessary being, God. He accepted that he was part of the whole of creation. He could not deny himself. Hence, he could not deny creation. As such, he could not deny God. As regards the second notion, Dr. Rizal argued that his God was not like the God of the Catholics, as his God was far above such things. He says to Fr. Pastells, \"In the conviction that I find myself before the Supreme Problem, which confused voices desire to explain to me, I cannot but answer: 'That may be so; but the God that I surmise is much greater, much better: \"Plus Supra\"!\" He thought that a requirement to the Godliness of God was His being above all things, which meant His being incomprehensible.  Dr. Rizal was clearly not convinced that a sufficient understanding of God that was as powerful and metaphysical as the Supreme Being could be contained in the consciousness of little mortals who have no capacity to understand beyond what was in the words of Nietzsche \"divined\" to them. Mortals who were so limited could not have possibly comprehended a limitless being. As such, Dr. Rizal articulated that the only genuine faith was \"blind faith.\" In short, the more people tried to explain to him what and who God was, the more he got convinced that they did not know what they were talking about. What Dr. Rizal meant by \"blind faith\" was, since it was impossible to comprehend God as He was \"Plus Supra\", he could have only hinged his belief on the fact that \"God was God.\" As such, he did not deny nor did he accept the religious explanations of the mortals around him. Blind faith was more of a disposition of philosophy than of religion. It was a disposition where one did not accept and deny despite having a personal conviction. As regards the third notion, Dr. Rizal believed that if one was to \"understand\" God, he was going to do well to note that books which others claimed were tools of revelation were not reliable. The reason was books were too removed from actual reality as these were written by people, interpreted by others, rewritten by people, obscured by others, etc. The best way to have an idea of God was through connecting with Him personally, directly and physically through His extensions. These extensions were nature. Dr. Rizal says to Fr. Pastells, \"I believe in revelation, yes, but in that living revelation of nature which surrounds us everywhere, in that potent voice, eternal, incessant, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal like the Being from which it originates, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can reveal to us better the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom?\" Clearly, Dr. Rizal's philosophico-religious view on God was well-reflected on. It was a product of competent ratiocination by an \"Indio\" whom the Spaniards then undermined. He did not content himself with the teachings he grew up with as a student of Catholic institutions. He explored, rationalized, and argued. He asked questions about faith and the fundamental teachings of the Church. He was however careful not to offend the religious sensibilities of his countrymen. To him, ratiocination was simply a gift from God. To not use it would thus have been offensive to the Giver.",

In \"The Myth of Sisyphus\", such dualism becomes paradoxical because humans greatly value their existence while at the same time being aware of their mortality. Camus believes it is human nature to have difficulty reconciling these paradoxes; and indeed, he believed humankind must accept what he called \"the Absurd\". On the other hand, Camus is not strictly an existential atheist because the acceptance of \"the Absurd\" implies neither the existence of God nor the nonexistence of God (compare agnosticism).",
