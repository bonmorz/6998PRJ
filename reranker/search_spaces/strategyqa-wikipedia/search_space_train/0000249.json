To say this is not to deny that messages may be read into them, but it should not be assumed that patrons would necessarily have cared about or understood or been motivated by theories and statements about their power and authority that may be coded into the works of art they paid for\". \" (Gosman, 61)",

Nowadays, the term \u2018general pharmacology\u2019 is no longer used, and the ICH S7A guidelines distinguish between primary pharmacodynamics (\u201cstudies on the mode of action and/or effects of a substance in relation to its desired therapeutic target\u201d), secondary pharmacodynamics (\u201cstudies on the mode of action and/or effects of a substance not related to its desired therapeutic target\u201d) and safety pharmacology (\u201cstudies that investigate the potential undesirable pharmacodynamic effects of a substance on physiological functions in relation to exposure in the therapeutic range and above.\u201d). A major stimulus to the discipline of safety pharmacology was the release in 1996 of a draft \u2018Points to Consider\u2019 document on QT prolongation by the European Medicines Agency\u2019s Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP), issued in final form the following year. This initiative had been prompted by growing concern of sudden death caused by drug-induced torsade de pointes, a potentially lethal cardiac tachyarrhythmia. Later, in 2005, this concern was addressed by issue of the ICH S7B guidelines.",

Pharmacodynamics studies the effects of a drug on biological systems, and Pharmacokinetics studies the effects of biological systems on a drug. In broad terms, pharmacodynamics discusses the chemicals with biological receptors, and pharmacokinetics discusses the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of chemicals from the biological systems. Pharmacology is not synonymous with pharmacy and the two terms are frequently confused. Pharmacology, a biomedical science, deals with the research, discovery, and characterization of chemicals which show biological effects and the elucidation of cellular and organismal function in relation to these chemicals. In contrast, pharmacy, a health services profession, is concerned with application of the principles learned from pharmacology in its clinical settings; whether it be in a dispensing or clinical care role.

The word \u201ccaesarian\u201d possibly derives from the ancient Roman ruler Julius Caesar, because it was believed that Caesar was delivered through this procedure. However, this is probably based more on tradition and myth than historical accuracies. Another possibility for the etymology of the word \u201ccaesarian\u201d is the Latin word \"caedere\", meaning \u201cto cut\u201d. This practice is probably much older than Julius Caesar, but \"C-sections\", as performed by the Romans, were done to rescue the baby from a dying or already dead mother, and were performed post-mortem. Evidence suggests that Jews in ancient Rome successfully practiced C-sections on living mothers who were not in danger of dying. Evidence of these procedures is found in several collections of ancient Roman rabbis, the most famous of which is called the Mishnah. Greeks and Egyptians did not perform C-sections, either post-mortem or on living mothers. However, Greeks would have had at least some knowledge of the Caesarian operation and the procedure involved. The Greek god Aesclepius was fabled to have been extracted from his mother\u2019s womb through this procedure. Other than the evidence of Jews practicing C-sections in antiquity (very little in ancient Rome, even less in ancient Greece), not much more evidence exists regarding Caesarian-operation birth. One reason could have been that C-sections were not performed very often because of medical complications or superstitions surrounding C-sections. In early Christian Rome, C-sections were almost non-existent. Loss of skill is a possibility for the lack of C-sections. Infant mortality rates were high in antiquity, so C-sections certainly could have been useful. However, early Christian doctors could have disregarded C-sections as a socially acceptable operation because of religious beliefs. Disease, a perceived need for secrecy, and social discouragement could have also been factors that lead to the decline in C-sections among early Christians in Rome. Almost no evidence exists for C-sections in the Christian world until the 10th century.",

Since the Gauls came to know the elephant through the Punic commander Hannibal, it is possible that the animal was also known under the name \"caesar\" or \"caesai\" in Gaul. Caesar used the animal during his conquest of Gaul and probably of Britain, which is further supported by the inclusion of forty elephants on the first day of Caesar's Gallic triumph in Rome. Caesar displayed an elephant above the name on his first \"denarius\", which he probably had minted while still in Gallia Cisalpina. Apart from using the elephant as a claim for extraordinary political power in Rome, the coin is an unmasked allusion to this etymology of the name and directly identifies Caesar with the elephant, because the animal treads a Gallic serpent-horn, the \"carnyx\", as a symbolic depiction of Caesar's own victory.",

While chronology suggested that the tribune might be the son of the Sextus who had been praetor in 208 BC, the consul's filiation indicated that his grandfather's name was \"Lucius\". Accordingly, Drumann inferred the existence of an otherwise unknown Lucius Julius Caesar between the praetor and the military tribune, although in order to make sense chronologically, the praetor would have to have been rather elderly and the tribune very young when they held their respective offices. More recent scholarship has concluded that the military tribune and the consul were the same man, which means that his grandfather, Lucius, was the father of the praetor of 208 BC, rather than his son.",

In 'The Life of Crassus', Plutarch did not mention this repeal and, as mentioned above, he only wrote that Pompey and Crassus disagreed on everything and that as a result their consulship did not achieve anything. Yet, the restoration of tribunician powers was a highly significant measure and a turning point in the politics of the late Republic. This measure must have been opposed by the aristocracy and it would have been unlikely that it would have been passed if the two consuls had opposed each other. Crassus does not feature much in the writings of the ancient sources. Unfortunately, the books of Livy, otherwise the most detailed of the sources, which cover this period have been lost. However, the Periochae, a short summary of Livy's work, records that \"Marcus Crassus and Gnaeus Pompey were made consuls ... and reconstituted the tribunician powers.\" Suetonius wrote that when Julius Caesar was a military tribune \"he ardently supported the leaders in the attempt to re-establish the authority of the tribunes of the commons [the plebeians], the extent of which Sulla had curtailed.\" The two leaders must obviously have been the two consuls, Crassus and Pompey.",

The tribunes, insulting the crowd for their change in loyalty from Pompey to Caesar, attempt to end the festivities and break up the commoners, who return the insults. During the feast of Lupercal, Caesar holds a victory parade and a soothsayer warns him to \"Beware the ides of March\", which he ignores. Meanwhile, Cassius attempts to convince Brutus to join his conspiracy to kill Caesar. Although Brutus, friendly towards Caesar, is hesitant to kill him, he agrees that Caesar may be abusing his power. They then hear from Casca that Mark Antony has offered Caesar the crown of Rome three times and that each time Caesar refused it with increasing reluctance, in hopes that the crowd watching the exchange would beg him to accept the crown, yet the crowd applauded Caesar for denying the crown, upsetting Caesar, due to him wanting to accept the crown. On the eve of the ides of March, the conspirators meet and reveal that they have forged letters of support from the Roman people to tempt Brutus into joining. Brutus reads the letters and, after much moral debate, decides to join the conspiracy, thinking that Caesar should be killed to \"prevent\" him from doing anything against the people of Rome if he were ever to be crowned.",

            "document": "Balbi . Lucius Cornelius Balbus was another very famous Balbi. He was born to a family of nobility in Gades, now Cadiz. He and Julius Caesar became acquainted when Caesar's troops were fighting in France and Spain. Balbus assisted Caesar in this endeavor. He was granted Roman citizenship along with his brother P. Cornelius Balbus and his brother's sons. P. Cornelius Balbus died shortly thereafter. At the conclusion of the war in 72 B. C. Caesar brought Balbus back to Rome where he became a powerful ally. His reported tremendous wealth earned him the friendship of Pompey from whom he received Roman citizenship. Balbus lived in Rome as a friend of Pompey and especially Caesar, whose interests he increasingly attended, ultimately becoming the manager and steward of Caesar's affairs in Rome. In 56 B.C. he was prosecuted for receiving his citizenship illegally. Pompey and Crassus both testified upon his behalf, and Cicero delivered one of his finest speeches, resulting in full acquittal. When civil war erupted, Balbus remained outwardly neutral, although he was Caesar's representative in personal matters. After Julius Caesar's death in 44 B. C. Balbus gave his support to Octavian as Caesar's heir, and was rewarded for this by his election to the consulship, becoming Rome's first foreign-born consul in 40 BC. Wealthy beyond all others, in his will he left 25 denarii to each citizen of Rome. A coin was minted in his honor. On the front is the head of Caesar Augustus and on the reverse is the inscription BALBVS Pro. Per. Balbus was the author of a diary of the most remarkable occurrences in his and Caesar's life. Unfortunately this document has not been found.",
