Indeed, the original haiku included the theme \"oni\" (the \"it\" in Japanese is a demon, though in some parts a very young child forced to play \"it\" was called a \"sea slug\" (namako)). To him, seeing a game of hide-and-seek, or recalling it as it grew cold would be a chilling experience. Terayama might also have recalled opening his eyes and finding himself all alone, feeling the cold more intensely than he did a minute before among other children. Either way, any genuinely personal experience would be haiku and not senry\u016b in the classic sense. If you think Terayama's poem uses a child's game to express in hyperbolic metaphor how, in retrospect, life is short, and nothing more, then this would indeed work as a senry\u016b. Otherwise, it is a bona-fide haiku. There is also the possibility that it is a joke about playing hide and seek, only to realize (winter having arrived during the months spent hiding) that no one wants to find you.",

All of the traditions above would be appropriate to include in haiku as \"kigo\" (season words). There are also haiku that celebrate many of the \"first\" of the New Year, such as the \"first sun\" (\"hatsuhi\") or \"first sunrise\", \"first laughter\" (\"waraizome\"\u2014starting the New Year with a smile is considered a good sign), and first dream (\"hatsuyume\"). Since the traditional New Year was later in the year than the current date, many of these mention the beginning of spring.",

The book includes both translations from Japanese and original poems of his own in English, which had previously appeared in his book titled \"A Pepper-Pod: Classic Japanese Poems together with Original Haiku\". In these books Yasuda presented a critical theory about haiku, to which he added comments on haiku poetry by early 20th-century poets and critics. His translations apply a 5\u20137\u20135 syllable count in English, with the first and third lines end-rhymed. Yasuda considered that haiku translated into English should utilize all of the poetic resources of the language. Yasuda's theory also includes the concept of a \"haiku moment\" based in personal experience, and provides the motive for writing a haiku (' an aesthestic moment' of a timeless feeling of enlightened harmony as the poet's nature and the environment are unified'). This notion of the haiku moment has resonated with haiku writers in English, even though the notion is not widely promoted in Japanese haiku.(See however, 'Shiki's Haiku Moments for Us Today'",

He is quoted by haiku author and book editor Cor van den Heuvel as saying he wrote haiku \"to get in touch with the real\". Virgilio experimented with the haiku form, trying several innovations that other American haiku poets were exploring, including dropping the traditional 5-7-5 syllable count in favor of shorter forms. He sometimes included rhyme in his haiku along with the gritty reality of urban America. A collection of his selected haiku was published in 1985.
