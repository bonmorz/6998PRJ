After Matilda was widowed in 1125, she returned to her father in England, who then secured her marriage to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but after Henry I's death in 1135 Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned, before Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France.

He notices first that \u2018man is a biological being with a physical body\u2019, which is the \u2018less than God\u2019, as we think of \u2018God as a being of pure spirit, lifted above the categories of time and space\u2019. The psalmist would then say that God made man that way, and because of this \u2018there is nothing wrong with it\u2019 and that \u2018everything God makes is good; therefore there is nothing wrong with it\u2019. The Greeks, as King informs us, \u2018felt the body was evil\u2019 and that the \u2018soul could never reach its full maturity until it broke loose from the prison of the body\u2019. However, Christianity raises the view that \u2018the body is not the principle of evil; it says the will is the principle of evil\u2019. He then defines that in \u2018any doctrine of man, we must be concerned with man's physical well being\u2019. To support this he brings up Jesus` quote that we need the \u201cbread\u201d to survive and also states \u2018this isn\u2019t the only part\u2019 and if we stop here we would see \u2018man merely as an animal\u2019. He then brings an example of chemists who calculated that the values of man came to \u2018about ninety-eight cents\u2019, today with our living standards it comes to \u2018a dollar ninety eight for the average man\u2019. King challenges this idea by questioning \u2018But can we explain the whole of man in terms of ninety eight cents?\u2019 and brings up examples of human genius; and again asks \u2018Can we explain the mystery of the human soul in terms of ninety eight cents?\u2019 To this he answers \u201cno\u201d and states that \u2018man is a child of God\u2019 and raises the second basic point of the doctrine \u2018that man is a being of spirit\u2019, which is the \u2018thou has crowned him with glory and honour\u2019, and because of our \u2018rational capacity, man has a mind, man can reason. This distinguishes us from the lower animals\u2019. King then defines man as \u2018God\u2019s marvellous creation. Through his mind he can leap oceans, break through walls, and transcend the categories of time and space\u2019. With this he defines what the biblical writers meant when they said \u2018man is made in the image of God\u2019, and that he has \u2018rational capacity; he has the unique ability to have a fellowship with God. Man is a being of spirit\u2019.",

When only the minimum (or maximum) is needed, a good approach is to use a heap, which is able to find the minimum (or maximum) element in constant time, while all other operations, including insertion, are O(log \"n\") or better. More generally, a self-balancing binary search tree can easily be augmented to make it possible to both insert an element and find the \"k\"th largest element in O(log \"n\") time; this is called an \"order statistic tree.\" We simply store in each node a count of how many descendants it has, and use this to determine which path to follow. The information can be updated efficiently since adding a node only affects the counts of its O(log \"n\") ancestors, and tree rotations only affect the counts of the nodes involved in the rotation.",

Hirschman described the concept of the Hiding Hand principle in the second section of his essay \"The Principle of the Hiding Hand\" where he states: We may be dealing here with a general principle of action. Creativity always comes as a surprise to us; therefore we can never count on it and we dare not believe in it until it has happened. In other words, we would not consciously engage upon tasks whose success clearly requires that creativity be forthcoming. Hence, the only way in which we can bring our creative resources fully into play is by misjudging the nature of the task, by presenting it to ourselves as more routine, simple, undemanding of genuine creativity than it will turn out to be.  Or, put differently: since we necessarily underestimate our creativity it is desirable that we underestimate to a roughly similar extent the difficulties of the tasks we face, so as to be tricked by these two offsetting underestimates into undertaking tasks which we can, but otherwise would not dare, tackle. The principle is important enough to deserve a name: since we are apparently on the trail here of some sort of Invisible or Hidden Hand that beneficially hides difficulties from us, I propose \"The Hiding Hand.\"",

King Evan of England goes to war with King Begon of Norway; to resolve matters they arrange a marriage between Evan and Begon\u2019s daughter, Eufeme. Later, two Counts marry twin girls. Both Counts dispute over the twins\u2019 inheritance and settle things by fighting, but end up killing each other. Evan, upset that two men died fighting because of women, proclaims that women can no longer inherit as long as he rules. Evan then goes to Winchester, where he and his men encounter a dragon in the woods. The King announces that if any of them are able to slaughter the dragon, he will give them a county and his pick of any woman in the kingdom. Cador, a knight who is in love with a woman named Eufemie who serves the Queen, successfully faces the dragon. Back home, Cador is welcomed warmly because of his bravery. Eufemie, who also loves Cador, is eager to marry him, but Cador falls ill from the venom and fumes encountered while fighting the dragon. Evan promises Eufemie that he will grant her marriage to any available man in the kingdom if she can cure Cador. Eufemie cures Cador, each of them falling more in love with the other. When they finally admit their feelings for each other, they ask the King to make good on his promises. The King gives his consent, along with 1,000 pounds a year and the territory of Cornwall once Eufemie\u2019s father, Count Renald, passes away. Count Renald dies a year after Cador and Eufemie get married. Cador inherits the county of Cornwall, and he and Eufemie conceive a child. If it is a girl, Cador has the idea to lie to everybody and tell them that it is a boy, that way their child will be able to inherit no matter what.",

This rule can be seen in the examples \"there is less flour in this canister\" and \"there are fewer cups (grains, pounds, bags, etc.) of flour in this canister\", which are based on the reasoning that flour is uncountable whereas the unit used to measure the flour (cup etc.) is countable. Nevertheless, even most prescriptivists accept the most common usage \"there are less cups of flour in this canister\" and prescribe the rule addition that \"less\" should be used with units of measurement (other examples: \"less than 10 pounds/dollars\"). Prescriptivists would however consider \"fewer cups of coffee\" to be correct in a sentence such as \"there are fewer cups of coffee on the table now\", where the cups are countable separate objects. In addition, \"less\" is recommended in front of counting nouns that denote distance, amount, or time.
