Maura Johnston of \"The Guardian\" wrote a negative review of the song, faulting the \"sloppy\" lyrics and blaming Swift for not giving a clear context in the lyrics. Lindsay Zolad of The Ringer said \"Unleashed on a deeply confused public late Thursday night, the song is a strange collage of retro reference points: mid-aughts Gossip Girl placement pop, the soundtrack to Disney's live-action Maleficent, and \u2014 yes, really \u2014 Right Said Fred's I'm Too Sexy, except devoid of the self-effacing humor and wit. Yes, the new Taylor Swift song just made me compliment Right Said Fred.\" Brittany Spanos of \"Rolling Stone\" believed that the song marked a continuation of the feud between Swift and rapper Kanye West; the latter had previously name-dropped Swift in his song \"Famous\" by using the line, \"I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? / I made that bitch famous\". The single was noted as being a darker, angrier work than what Swift had done before. Hugh McIntye of \"Forbes\" was critical of the change in style, saying that it \"didn't sound like [Swift]\" and that it \"may have some kinks to work out\". Meaghan Garvey from \"Pitchfork\" referred to it in a review as \"a hardcore self-own\" track.",

            "document": "Inscrutability of reference . In his indeterminacy of translation theory Quine claims that, if one is to translate a language, there are always several alternative translations, of which none is more correct than the other. A radical translation is therefore impossible. As a special part of this theory the inscrutability of reference indicates that, in trying to find out to which object a certain word (also sentence, sign etc.) of a language refers, there is never only one single possibility. That is even the case, if the possibilities that come into consideration lie very close together. Quine's example of the word \"gavagai\" is used to illustrate this. Note that it is also applied at the indeterminacy of translation, but has traditionally been introduced to point up referential inscrutability. The \"gavagai\" thought experiment tells about a linguist, who tries to find out, what the expression \"gavagai\" means, when uttered by a speaker of a yet unknown, native language upon seeing a rabbit. At first glance, it seems that \"gavagai\" simply translates with \"rabbit\". Now, Quine points out that the background language and its referring devices might fool the linguist here, because he is misled in a sense that he always makes direct comparisons between the foreign language and his own. However, when shouting \"gavagai\", and pointing at a rabbit, the natives could as well refer to something like \"undetached rabbit-parts\", or \"rabbit-tropes\" and it would not make any observable difference. The behavioural data the linguist could collect from the native speaker would be the same in every case, or to reword it, several translation hypotheses could be built on the same sensoric stimuli. Hence, the reference between the term \"gavagai\" and its referring object is language- or framework-dependent, and therefore inscrutable. Quine regards this discovery as trivial, because it is already a widely accepted fact that all the different things one word might refer to can be switched out, because of their proxy functions. Quine does not want to show that those native speakers might speak in interestingly different ways and we cannot know about it, but rather that there is nothing to be known. Not only is it impossible to discern, by any method, the correct translation and referential relation of \"gavagai\", but, in fact, there is not even a correct answer to this question. To make sense of the word \"gavagai\" either way, the linguist simply has to assume that the native speaker does not refer to complicated terms like \"rabbits-tropes\". The finding, then, that \"gavagai\" means \"rabbit\" is not really a translation, but merely a common sense interpretation. It is important to note that indeterminacy and inscrutability not only occur in the course of translating something from a native, unknown language into a familiar one, but among every language. This holds also for languages which are quite similar, like German and Dutch, and even for speakers of the same language. One cannot with certainty say, what exactly his/her conversational partner refers to, when that person is talking about a rabbit. We commonly use the homophonic rule in those cases, i.e., if one utters \"rabbit\", we assume s/he uses it in the same way we do. But, as has been shown, there are multiple possibilities which can be indistinguishable from one another. This also applies in our own case. We ourselves do not know what it is we are referring to in using the word \"rabbit\", that is because there is, in Quine's word, \"no fact of the matter\" at all. One must not, however, use different possible referential objects in the same translation, because they are incommensurable and the resulting translation hypothesis would contain logical fallacies.",

What are the motives that lead a society, and individuals within that society, to rationally calculate a benevolent formula for mutual existence? For utilitarians and also followers of Kant, provide an answer to these questions in terms of how we calculate the outcome of our acts and (for Kantians) the motives behind our actions.

To aid her in choosing the songs, Swift performed various new tracks \u2013 \"Permanent Marker\", \"Missing You\", \"I'd Lie\", \"Sparks Fly\", and \"Fearless\" \u2013 at the Gold Country Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada on May 29 and 30, 2007; only the latter song was chosen for the album. By January 2008, Swift had recorded approximately half of the songs that would remain on the final cut of \"Fearless\". The remainder of the songs resulted from the last two recording sessions: one held in March 2008, the other held sometime in the summer of 2008. When asked to describe the album, Swift commented, \"It's the same kind of album I made (in 2006) \u2013 just two years older. Sound-wise, it's the kind of songs I like to write, which are country songs, but I guess because of the subject matter and because of some of the melodies I love to use, I guess they have crossover appeal.\"",

            "document": "1989 (Taylor Swift album) . \"Out of the Woods\" is a synthpop song, and the first song for which Swift wrote lyrics to a pre-existing track. Martin produced Swift's vocals for the song. Featuring heavy synths and percussion, Antonoff described that the song is given an arrangement that combines both 1980s and modern elements. A Yamaha DX7 is used for the 1980s-tinged sounds apparent on most parts of the song, but they are countered with the Minimoog Voyager during the chorus sections. \"All You Had to Do Was Stay\" was inspired by a dream of Swift's rather than a real-life romance. Swift recalled: \"I was trying to talk to someone important ... And that's all that would come out of my mouth. I woke up so weirded out!\" \"Shake It Off\" is an uptempo pop song with a sound that is in stark contrast to Swift's previous releases, and consists of a central saxophone line. Jason Lipshutz from \"Billboard\" compared the song's melody to that of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis' song \"Thrift Shop\" (2012). Lyrically, the song is dedicated to Swift's detractors. Swift explained that, \"I've learned a pretty tough lesson that people can say whatever they want about us at any time, and we cannot control that. The only thing we can control is our reaction to that.\"",

Swift explained, \"When it came out, I fell in love with the way that she makes music.\" Swift later contacted her management and asked if she could write a song with Caillat. They confirmed Caillat would be available due to a then upcoming concert in Nashville, Tennessee and, coincidentally, on the same day, Swift had a vacation day. According to Swift, \"Breathe\" is about having to depart from a someone, however, not blaming anyone. Swift believed the scenario was one of the most difficult goodbyes, \"when it's nobody's fault. It just has to end.\" Swift explained, \"It was total therapy because I came in and I was like look, 'One of my best friends, I'm gonna have to not see anymore and it's not gonna be part of what I do. It's the hardest thing to go through. It's crazy listening to the song because you would think it's about a relationship and it's really about losing a friend and having a fallout.\" Caillat and Swift said one of the beauties of the song was that many people would be able to relate to it because it is never specific as why the departure is occurring or whose fault it was.",

Over the course of that period, Swift composed over 250 songs, either alone or collaborating with other songwriters, mostly with Liz Rose or Robert Ellis Orrall, and refused to give them away to already established acts with intentions of someday singing them herself. When later signed to Big Machine Records, Swift compiled her \"Taylor Swift\" album of material written during her publishing contract, and expected to do the same for her second album. She said, \"I've been very selfish about my songs. I had this dream of this project [\"Taylor Swift\"] coming out for so many years now that I just stockpiled. I'm so happy that I did because now we have a second album full of songs and a third album full of songs, and I don't have to lift a finger.\" However, when embarking on her first and second tour as opening act for Rascal Flatts and George Strait, respectively, Swift continued to compose numerous songs. \"I've written a lot of songs by myself lately, especially since I've been alone so much on the road,\" she said. \"I do love writing on the road \u2013 I usually write at the concert venue.

Writing for NPR, Viviane Rutabingwa and James Kassaga Arinaitwe criticized the video for \"present[ing] a glamorous version of the white colonial fantasy of Africa\" and ignoring the brutality of colonialism. \"[...] We don't totally blame Taylor Swift, but the people behind the video should have done a little more research. They should have wondered how Africans would react. This nostalgia that privileged white people have for colonial Africa is awkwardly confusing to say the least and offensive to say the most.\" Lauren Duca of \"The Huffington Post\" criticized the video for bringing back \"white colonialism\" despite the fact that both its producer and its editor are African-American. Duca opined that \"Instead of the cultural appropriation that has become almost status quo in today's pop music, Swift has opted for the bolder option of actually just embodying the political exploitation of a region and its people. It's brave, really. Almost as brave as moving sensuously in the vicintiy [\"sic\"] of a real-life lion.\" Lauretta Charlton of Vulture.com responded to these criticisms, writing \"I am a black woman, and this week the internet says I should be angry because Taylor Swift's \"Wildest Dreams\" video is set in an Africa full of white people...Racists are very real. Colonialism is very real. But Taylor Swift is not a racist, and her \"Wildest Dreams\" video is not a boon for colonialism. Take a deep breath, exhale, and direct our rage toward something that matters.\" Joseph Kahn, who directed the video, responded to accusations that the video glorified colonialism, saying: \u201cWe collectively decided it would have been historically inaccurate to load the crew with more black actors as the video would have been accused of rewriting history. This video is set in the past by a crew set in the present. This is not a video about colonialism but a love story on the set of a period film crew in Africa, 1950.\u201d",

It commences with Swift and her best friend in a grey 2009 Ford Mustang GT 45th Anniversary Edition, parked behind a tree. Swift reminiscences, looking at a photograph of her and her ex-boyfriend together, and states, \"Would you look at how happy we were back then? I can't believe he turned out to be such a jerk.\" Anderson is then seen ogling outside the window with binoculars, and spots Swift's ex-boyfriend and another woman arriving in a black late 90s Ford F-150 pick-up truck. She notes the other woman is driving the truck, and Swift states angrily he never allowed her to drive it. As Swift's ex-boyfriend and the woman start frolicking inside the truck, the music begins and the video transcends to a concrete room where the singer (clothed in a grey, one-shoulder mini-dress and black leather, thigh-length boots) is playing an electric guitar, alongside her backup band. During the song's chorus, fire ignites behind them. Afterwards, the band is depicted entering a house furtively, using flashlights. Swift is sitting on a brown couch, sporting a black tank top, black leather pants and a beehive hairdo, as the band ransacks the house. They throw darts at photographs of Swift's ex, envelop all of his furniture with toilet paper, mess his mirror with the word \"loser\", lick his utensils and spit into his mouthwash. Suddenly, the ex-boyfriend and the woman are shown approaching the house, and, seeing this, Anderson informs Swift and the band via handheld transceiver. He enters the house and discovers it was ransacked, and repeats the name \"Taylor\". The video then transitions to Anderson and Swift inside the Ford Mustang, with Anderson also repeating \"Taylor\". She then suggests leaving, and Swift says, \"You know what? I'm over it.\" The video concludes with the photograph of Swift and her ex-boyfriend in flames, thrown in the sidewalk. Cut-scenes feature Swift and her band performing in the concrete room, Swift singing on the couch, or Swift dancing affront a shower of sparks. To date, the video has 98 million views on YouTube.",
