Wodehouse believed that one of the factors that made his stories humorous was his view of life, and he stated that \"If you take life fairly easily, then you take a humorous view of things. It's probably because you were born that way.\" He carried this view through into his writing, describing the approach as \"making the thing a sort of musical comedy without music, and ignoring real life altogether\". The literary critic Edward L. Galligan considers Wodehouse's stories to show his mastery in adapting the form of the American musical comedy for his writings. Wodehouse would ensure that his first draft was as carefully and accurately done as possible, correcting and refining the prose as he wrote, and would then make another good copy, before proof reading again and then making a final copy for his publisher. Most of Wodehouse's canon is set in an undated period around the 1920s and 1930s. The critic Anthony Lejeune describes the settings of Wodehouse's novels, such as the Drones Club and Blandings Castle, as \"a fairyland\". Although some critics thought Wodehouse's fiction was based on a world that had never existed, Wodehouse affirmed that \"it did. It was going strong between the wars\", although he agreed that his version was to some extent \"a sort of artificial world of my own creation\". The novels showed a largely unchanging world, regardless of when they were written, and only rarely\u2014and mistakenly in McCrum's view\u2014did Wodehouse allow modernity to intrude, as he did in the 1966 story \"Bingo Bans the Bomb\".",

Linguistic confusion is another humorous mechanism, such as in \"Uncle Dynamite\" when Constable Potter says he has been \"assaulted by the duck pond.\" In reply, Sir Aylmer, confusing the two meanings of the word \"by\", asks: \"How the devil can you be assaulted by a duck pond?\" Wodehouse also uses metaphor and mixed metaphor to add humour. Some come through exaggeration, such as Bingo Little's infant child who \"not only has the aspect of a mass murderer, but that of a mass murderer suffering from an ingrown toenail\", or Wooster's complaint that \"the rumpuses that Bobbie Wickham is already starting may be amusing to her, but not to the unfortunate toads beneath the harrow whom she ruthlessly plunges into the soup.\" Bertie Wooster's half-forgotten vocabulary also provides a further humorous device. In \"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit\" Bertie asks Jeeves \"Let a plugugly like young Thos loose in the community with a cosh, and you are inviting disaster and\u00a0... what's the word?

Born in Guildford, the son of a British magistrate based in Hong Kong, Wodehouse spent happy teenage years at Dulwich College, to which he remained devoted all his life. After leaving school, he was employed by a bank but disliked the work and turned to writing in his spare time. His early novels were mostly school stories, but he later switched to comic fiction, creating several regular characters who became familiar to the public over the years. They include the jolly gentleman of leisure Bertie Wooster and his sagacious valet Jeeves; the immaculate and loquacious Psmith; Lord Emsworth and the Blandings Castle set; the Oldest Member, with stories about golf; and Mr Mulliner, with tall tales on subjects ranging from bibulous bishops to megalomaniac movie moguls.",

Ineligible for military service because of his poor eyesight, he remained in the US throughout the war, detached from the conflict in Europe and absorbed in his theatrical and literary concerns. In September 1914 he married Ethel May Wayman, \"n\u00e9e\" Newton (1885\u20131984), an English widow. The marriage proved happy and lifelong. Ethel's personality was in contrast with her husband's: he was shy and impractical; she was gregarious, decisive and well organised. In Sproat's phrase, she \"took charge of Wodehouse's life and made certain that he had the peace and quiet he needed to write\". There were no children of the marriage, but Wodehouse came to love Ethel's daughter Leonora (1905\u20131944) and legally adopted her. Wodehouse experimented with different genres of fiction in these years; his \"Psmith, Journalist\", mixing comedy with social comment on slum landlords and racketeers, was published in 1915. In the same year \"The Saturday Evening Post\" paid $3,500 to serialise \"Something New\", the first of what became a series of novels set at Blandings Castle. It was published in hardback in the US and the UK in the same year (the British edition being retitled \"Something Fresh\"). It was Wodehouse's first farcical novel; it was also his first best-seller, and although his later books included some gentler, lightly sentimental stories, it was as a farceur that he became known. Later in the same year \"Extricating Young Gussie\", the first story about Bertie and Jeeves, was published. These stories introduced two sets of characters about whom Wodehouse wrote for the rest of his life. The Blandings Castle stories, set in an English stately home, depict the attempts of the placid Lord Emsworth to evade the many distractions around him, which include successive pairs of young lovers, the machinations of his exuberant brother Galahad, the demands of his domineering sisters and super-efficient secretaries, and anything detrimental to his prize sow, the Empress of Blandings. The Bertie and Jeeves stories feature an amiable young man-about-town, regularly rescued from the consequences of his idiocy by the benign interference of his valet.",

Originally, he was to work with his then-partner, Andrew Lloyd Webber, but Rice backed out of the project. Eventually Lloyd Webber teamed up with famed British playwright Alan Ayckbourn, and the two of them began work with the personal blessing of Wodehouse. Ayckbourn utilized characters and plot lines from several Jeeves and Wooster stories, notably \"The Code of the Woosters\". The action takes place at the East London Club for Unmanageable Boys, where Bertie Wooster is playing a banjo concert; his banjo keeps breaking down, so he is forced to tell stories to pass the time while Jeeves is sent off to fetch new strings.
