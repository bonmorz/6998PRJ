His early novels were mostly school stories, but he later switched to comic fiction, creating several regular characters who became familiar to the public over the years.

Wodehouse said that he based Psmith on the hotelier and impresario Rupert D'Oyly Carte\u2014\"the only thing in my literary career which was handed to me on a silver plate with watercress around it\". Wodehouse wrote in the 1970s that a cousin of his who had been at school with Carte told him of the latter's monocle, studied suavity, and stateliness of speech, all of which Wodehouse adopted for his new character. Psmith featured in three more novels: \"Psmith in the City\" (1910), a burlesque of banking; \"Psmith, Journalist\" (1915) set in New York; and \"Leave It to Psmith\" (1923), set at Blandings Castle.",

Wodehouse believed that one of the factors that made his stories humorous was his view of life, and he stated that \"If you take life fairly easily, then you take a humorous view of things. It's probably because you were born that way.\" He carried this view through into his writing, describing the approach as \"making the thing a sort of musical comedy without music, and ignoring real life altogether\". The literary critic Edward L. Galligan considers Wodehouse's stories to show his mastery in adapting the form of the American musical comedy for his writings. Wodehouse would ensure that his first draft was as carefully and accurately done as possible, correcting and refining the prose as he wrote, and would then make another good copy, before proof reading again and then making a final copy for his publisher. Most of Wodehouse's canon is set in an undated period around the 1920s and 1930s. The critic Anthony Lejeune describes the settings of Wodehouse's novels, such as the Drones Club and Blandings Castle, as \"a fairyland\". Although some critics thought Wodehouse's fiction was based on a world that had never existed, Wodehouse affirmed that \"it did. It was going strong between the wars\", although he agreed that his version was to some extent \"a sort of artificial world of my own creation\". The novels showed a largely unchanging world, regardless of when they were written, and only rarely\u2014and mistakenly in McCrum's view\u2014did Wodehouse allow modernity to intrude, as he did in the 1966 story \"Bingo Bans the Bomb\".",

A minimal number of Literacy Skill Quizzes in Accelerated Reader claim to assess higher order thinking skills. Eight Literacy Skill Quizzes have an ATOS level of 1.0-3.0, which provides limited support for higher order thinking skills for developing readers. Renaissance Place includes recognizing setting and understanding sequence as examples of higher order thinking. Turner and Paris's study on the role of classroom literacy tasks is particularly relevant. Their vignettes describing open versus closed tasks may inform how we consider Accelerated Reader. In this program, students usually take end-of-book tests called Reading Practice Quizzes that are composed of literal-recall questions to which there is only one answer. Turner and Paris would classify these quizzes as \"closed tasks.\". Turner and Paris ultimately concluded that open-ended tasks are more supportive of literacy growth in the future. This research prompts some educators to refrain from using Accelerated Reader quizzes out of fear that students will begin to perceive the purpose of reading as answering literal-recall questions and possibly lose the desire to read.",

Examples can be seen in \"Joy in the Morning\", Chapter 29: \"There was a sound in the background like a distant sheep coughing gently on a mountainside. Jeeves sailing into action\", or \"Psmith\", Chapter 7: \"A sound like two or three pigs feeding rather noisily in the middle of a thunderstorm interrupted his meditation.\" Hall also identifies that periodically Wodehouse used the stylistic device of a transferred epithet, with an adjective that properly belongs to a person applied instead to some inanimate object.

Ineligible for military service because of his poor eyesight, he remained in the US throughout the war, detached from the conflict in Europe and absorbed in his theatrical and literary concerns. In September 1914 he married Ethel May Wayman, \"n\u00e9e\" Newton (1885\u20131984), an English widow. The marriage proved happy and lifelong. Ethel's personality was in contrast with her husband's: he was shy and impractical; she was gregarious, decisive and well organised. In Sproat's phrase, she \"took charge of Wodehouse's life and made certain that he had the peace and quiet he needed to write\". There were no children of the marriage, but Wodehouse came to love Ethel's daughter Leonora (1905\u20131944) and legally adopted her. Wodehouse experimented with different genres of fiction in these years; his \"Psmith, Journalist\", mixing comedy with social comment on slum landlords and racketeers, was published in 1915. In the same year \"The Saturday Evening Post\" paid $3,500 to serialise \"Something New\", the first of what became a series of novels set at Blandings Castle. It was published in hardback in the US and the UK in the same year (the British edition being retitled \"Something Fresh\"). It was Wodehouse's first farcical novel; it was also his first best-seller, and although his later books included some gentler, lightly sentimental stories, it was as a farceur that he became known. Later in the same year \"Extricating Young Gussie\", the first story about Bertie and Jeeves, was published. These stories introduced two sets of characters about whom Wodehouse wrote for the rest of his life. The Blandings Castle stories, set in an English stately home, depict the attempts of the placid Lord Emsworth to evade the many distractions around him, which include successive pairs of young lovers, the machinations of his exuberant brother Galahad, the demands of his domineering sisters and super-efficient secretaries, and anything detrimental to his prize sow, the Empress of Blandings. The Bertie and Jeeves stories feature an amiable young man-about-town, regularly rescued from the consequences of his idiocy by the benign interference of his valet.",

In this stage the reader builds up a substantial background of knowledge of spelling. It is during this time in a reader's development that teachers and parents can be tricked by fluent-sounding reading into thinking that a child understands everything that he or she is reading.

This will assist them to understand the meaning of what they are reading beyond what is written on the page. While learning to read, one of the most powerful moments is when fluent comprehending readers learn to enter into the lives of imagined heroes and heroines. Examples of books where these imagined heroes and heroines could be found in include Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Huckleberry Finn. The comprehension process grows while reading books like these, where children learn how to connect prior knowledge, predict good or bad consequences, draw inferences from every danger-filled corner, monitor gaps in their understanding, and interpret how each new clue, revelation, or added piece of knowledge changes what they know.

Wodehouse's early career as a lyricist and playwright was profitable, and his work with Bolton, according to \"The Guardian\", \"was one of the most successful in the history of musical comedy\". At the outbreak of the Second World War he was earning \u00a340,000 a year from his work, which had broadened to include novels and short stories. Following the furore ensuing from the wartime broadcasts, he suffered a downturn in his popularity and book sales; \"The Saturday Evening Post\" stopped publishing his short stories, a stance they reversed in 1965, although his popularity\u2014and the sales figures\u2014slowly recovered over time. Wodehouse received great praise from many of his contemporaries, including Max Beerbohm, Rudyard Kipling, A.E. Housman and Evelyn Waugh\u2014the last of whom opines: \"One has to regard a man as a Master who can produce on average three uniquely brilliant and entirely original similes on each page.\" There are dissenters to the praise. The writer Alan Bennett thinks that \"inspired though his language is, I can never take more than ten pages of the novels at a time, their relentless flippancy wearing and tedious\", while the literary critic F. R. Leavis writes that Wodehouse had a \"stereotyped humour\u00a0... of ingenious variations on a laugh in one place\". In a 2010 study of Wodehouse's few relatively serious novels, such as \"The Coming of Bill\" (1919), \"Jill the Reckless\" (1920) and \"The Adventures of Sally\" (1922), David Heddendorf concludes that though their literary quality does not match that of the farcical novels, they show a range of empathy and interests that in real life\u2014and in his most comic works\u2014the author seemed to lack. \"Never oblivious to grief and despair, he opts in clear-eyed awareness for his timeless world of spats and woolly-headed peers. It's an austere, almost bloodless preference for pristine artifice over the pain and messy outcomes of actual existence, but it's a case of Wodehouse keeping faith with his own unique art.\"",
