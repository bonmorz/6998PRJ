The \"qi\u00e1np\u00f9\" would receive payment for their services in the form of taking a few cash coins from every string they composed, because of this a \"chu\u00e0n\" was more likely to consist of 990 coins rather than 1000 coins and because the profession of \"qi\u00e1np\u00f9\" had become a universally accepted practice these \"chu\u00e0ns\" were often still nominally valued at 1000 cash coins. The number of coins in a single string was locally determined as in one district a string could consist of 980 cash coins, while in another district this could only be 965 cash coins, these numbers were based on the local salaries of the \"qi\u00e1np\u00f9\". During the Qing dynasty the \"qi\u00e1np\u00f9\" would often search for older and rarer coins to sell these to coin collectors at a higher price.",

This system had been used in ancient India since the time of the Mahajanapadas. The exact ratio in value of the three metals varied greatly in different eras and places; for example, the opening of silver mines in the Harz mountains of central Europe made silver relatively less valuable, as did the flood of New World silver after the Spanish conquests.

            "document": "Chinese numismatic charm . Some Chinese cash coins were known to display features commonly seen in Chinese numismatic charms, Chinese coins with charm features have been created over two thousand years ago with the early Ban Liang and Wu Zhu cash coins, and when the first Chinese charms started appearing during the Han dynasty these coins were already commonplace. Many government issued cash coins and other currencies such as Spade and Knife money that did not have any extra charm-like features were considered to also have \u201ccharm-like qualities\u201d and were treated as charms by some people. The Wang Mang era Knife coin with a nominal value of 5,000 cash coins was often seen as a charm by the people because the character (or 1000) is written very similar to the character which means \"son\" so the inscription of the Knife coin could be read as \"worth five sons\" as this was very much desired in ancient Chinese society. A coin from Shu Han with the nominal value of 100 Wu Zhu cash coins featured a fish on the reverse of the inscription which symbolises \"abundance\" and \"perseverance\" in Chinese culture. Another Shu Han era coin contained the inscription of Tai Ping Bai Qian which was taken as an omen of peace and this coin is often considered to be a peace charm. During the Jin dynasty a coin was issued with the inscription \"f\u0113ng hu\u00f2\" (\u8c50\u8ca8) which could be translated as \"(the) coin of abundance\" and it was believed by the people at the time that if someone would possess this coin that this would be economically beneficial for them which is why this coin is commonly referred to as the \"cash of riches\" in popular tongue. During the Tang dynasty period images of clouds, crescents, and stars were often added on coins which the Chinese continued to use in subsequent dynasties. During the Jurchen Jin dynasty coins were cast with reverse inscriptions that featured characters from the twelve earthly branches and ten heavenly stems. During the Ming dynasty stars were sometimes used decoratively on some official government produced cash coins. Under the Manchu Qing dynasty \"y\u014dng zh\u00e8ng t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" (\u96cd\u6b63\u901a\u5bf6) cash coins cast by the Lanzhou Mint were considered to be charms or amulets capable of warding off evil spirits and demons because the Manchu word \"gung\" looked similar to the broadsword used by the Chinese God of War, Emperor Guan. The commemorative \"k\u0101ng x\u012b t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" (\u5eb7\u7199\u901a\u5bf6) cast for the Kangxi Emperor's 60th birthday in the year 1713 was believed to have \"the powers of a charm\" immediately when it entered circulation, this commemorative coin vontains a slightly different version of the Hanzi symbol \"\", at the bottom of the cash, as this character would most commonly have a vertical line at the left part of it but did not have it, and the part of this symbol which was usually inscripted as \"\" has the middle part written as a \"\" instead. Notably, the upper left area of the symbol \"\" only contains a single dot as opposed of the usual two dots used during this era. Several myths were attributed to this coin over the following three-hundred years since it has been cast such as the myth that the coin was cast from molten down golden statues of the 18 disciples of the Buddha which earned this coin the nicknames \"the Lohan coin\" and \"Arhat money\". These commemorative \"k\u0101ng x\u012b t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" cash coins were given to children as \"y\u0101 su\u00ec qi\u00e1n\" (\u58d3\u6b72\u9322) during Chinese new year, some women wore them akin to how an engagement ring is worn today, and in rural Shanxi young men wore this special \"k\u0101ng x\u012b t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" cash coin between their teeth like men from cities had golden teeth.

The mints outside of Rome stamped the coins with the arms of their respective cities, or with those of the cardinal legate, of the vice-legate, or of the governor; thus, Cardinal Scipione Borghese in 1612 struck coins at Avignon with his own name and arms, omitting the name of the pope, an example that was followed a year later by the pro-legate Cardinal Filonardi. The city very often placed the image of its patron saint on its coins. The date came to be stamped on coins that were struck during the vacancies of the Holy See, occasionally at first, and later as a rule; it rarely appears on other coins before 1550; the practice became general in the seventeenth century, the year of the Christian era or that of the pontificate being used; and Gregory XVI established it by law, as also the requirement that each coin should bear upon it an expression of its value. At Bologna as early as the seventeenth century, the value of gold or silver coins was usually indicated with the figures 20, 40, 80, etc., i.e. so many bolognini or baiocchi; at Rome, in the eighteenth century, nearly all the copper coins bore an indication of their value. The rim of papal coins rarely bore an inscription; at most, the monogram of the city in which the coin was struck was stamped upon it. From the sixteenth century, the engravers, also, put their ciphers on the coins; among these engravers may be named Benvenuto Cellini, Francesco Raibolini, called il Francia (Bologna), the four Hamerani, Giulio Romano (trident), Cavaliere Lucenti, Andrea Perpenti etc. Until the time of Pius VI, the dies for the mint remained the property of the engravers.",

The T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao or \"\u0110\u1ed3ng Sao\" (\u9285\u9214, billets of copper) were introduced by the Ministry of Finance in the year T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c 14 (1961) for large transactions and taxes on behalf of stores of the government of \u0110\u1ea1i Nam, the introduction of the T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao marked the redefinition of the ti\u1ec1n or m\u1ea1ch denominations and the qu\u00e0n (strings of cash coins) where the qu\u00e0n was made equal to 10 m\u1ea1ch and the m\u1ea1ch was made the equivalent of 60 zinc cash coins, under these exchange rates 1 qu\u00e0n was worth a string of 600 zinc cash coins. The \"\u0110\u1ed3ng Sao\" series of cash coins was introduced as zinc cash coins were heavy in quantity to carry around for the payment of larger sums of money, to this end the government introduced a system of monetary units determined by their nominal value in zinc cash coins as opposed to their intrinsic market value, it is possible that this might have been inspired by contemporary Chinese coinage of the Xianfeng era in the Qing dynasty where large denomination coins from 4 up to 1000 v\u0103n circulated alongside each other with little to no difference in intrinsic value in a fiduciary system, this system was also used by the Vietnamese. When the T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao was first proposed the Mandarins of the imperial court of \u0110\u1ea1i Nam suggested to simply increase the weight of the brass T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u00f4ng B\u1ea3o to make them worth more relative to the zinc T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u00f4ng B\u1ea3o cash coins as 1 brass cash coin with a weight of 9 ph\u1ea7n was worth four zinc cash coins. The value of the \"\u0110\u1ed3ng Sao\" cash coins was indicated on the reverses of the coins expressed in their worth in zinc cash coins preceded by the character (chu\u1ea9n, regarded as equal to), despite the fact that Sao (\u9214) means \"paper money\", though imperfectly the denominations of these coins attempted to take the respective value of brass and zinc cash coins into account which means that they can\u2019t be fully qualified as a fiat currency. The Ministry of Finances of \u0110\u1ea1i Nam originally set the exchange rate between the brass T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao and zinc cash coins heavily in favour of the larger denominations which wasn't accepted by the market which resulted in the imperial court attempting to adjust the exchange rate more to the contemporary exchange values of brass and zinc cash coins that were in circulation. In January 1868 by decree the exchange rate between brass 9 ph\u1ea7n cash and zinc cash coins was fixed 1:4 replacing the early ratio of 1:2.67 that had been in place since 1858. The T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao was generally well received by the population of \u0110\u1ea1i Nam despite the fact that their circulation was reduced due to their high purchasing power relative to their intrinsic value until their weight was decreased, which was done by the government to conform to the new official exchange between brass and zinc cash coins.",

Various official coin inscriptions already have very auspicious meanings which is also why these inscriptions were selected to be used on Chinese numismatic charms and amulets, during times of crisis and disunity such as under the reign of Wang Mang the number of charms with coin inscriptions seem to increase enormously. Meanwhile, other Chinese cash coin inscriptions were selected due to a perceived force in the metal used in the casting of these contemporary cash coins, an example would be the Later Zhou dynasty era \"zh\u014du yu\u00e1n t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" (\u5468\u5143\u901a\u5bf6) charm based on cash coins with the same inscription. Even long after the fall of the Xin dynasty charms with inscriptions from Wang Mang era coinage, and charms were produced with inscriptions like the Northern Zhou era \"w\u01d4 x\u00edng d\u00e0 b\u00f9\" (\u4e94\u884c\u5927\u5e03) because it could be translated as \"5 elements coin\", the Later Zhou dynasty's \"zh\u014du yu\u00e1n t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" (\u5468\u5143\u901a\u5bf6), the Song dynasty era \"t\u00e0i p\u00edng t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" (\u592a\u5e73\u901a\u5bf6), the Khitan Liao dynasty era \"qi\u0101n qi\u016b w\u00e0n su\u00ec\" (\u5343\u79cb\u842c\u6b72, \"thousand autumns and ten thousand years\"), as well as the Jurchen Jin dynasty era \"t\u00e0i h\u00e9 zh\u00f2ng b\u01ceo\" (\u6cf0\u548c\u91cd\u5bf6). Northern Song dynasty era charms may have been based on actual Mother coins that were used to produce the official cash coins produced by the government but were given different reverses to make them into charms. During the Ming dynasty there were Chinese charms based on the \"h\u00f3ng w\u01d4 t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" (\u6d2a\u6b66\u901a\u5bf6) with an image of a boy (or possible the Emperor) riding either an ox or water buffalo, this charm became very popular as the first Emperor of the Ming dynasty was born as a peasant and spent his early life as one and eventually attained the title of Emperor which inspired many people that they could also do great things despite their lowly birth. There were also a large number of Chinese numismatic charms cast with the reign title Zheng De (\u6b63\u5fb7\u901a\u5bf6), despite the government having deprecated cash coins for paper money at the time and these charms were often given to children as gifts. During the Manchu Qing dynasty a charm was cast with the inscription \"qi\u00e1n l\u00f3ng t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" (\u4e7e\u9686\u901a\u5bf6), but was fairly larger and had the \"t\u014dng b\u01ceo\" (\u901a\u5bf6) part of the cash coin written in a slightly different style as well as had the Manchu characters on its reverse indicating its place of origin rotated 90 degrees.

Beginning in 1180 coins cast by the Southern Song government started to cast the reign year on the reverses of coins as well as mint marks in order to stop forgeries from circulated, this was because the technology to cast inscriptions on both sides of the coins hasn't been adopted yet by private mints at the time. From 1180 until the end of the Song dynasty very few bronze coins were produced by the government as the preference went to iron, this was because bronze cash coins needed to have a specific typeface which was more intricate to produce.",

The motto disappeared from the five-cent coin in 1883, and did not reappear until production of the Jefferson nickel began in 1938. However, at least two other coins minted in every year in the interim still bore the motto, including the Morgan dollar and the Seated Liberty half dollar. The omission of the motto \"In God We Trust\" on the Indian Head eagle coin caused public outrage, and prompted Congress to pass a bill mandating its inclusion. Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber added the words and made minor modifications to the design. In 1908, Congress made it mandatory that the phrase be printed on all coins upon which it had previously appeared. This decision was motivated after a public outcry following the release of a $20 coin which did not bear the motto. The motto has been in continuous use on the one-cent coin since 1909, and on the ten-cent coin since 1916. It also has appeared on all gold coins and silver dollar coins, half-dollar coins, and quarter-dollar coins struck since July 1, 1908. Since 1938, all US coins have borne the motto. During the Cold War era, the government of the United States sought to distinguish itself from the Soviet Union, which promoted state atheism and thus implemented antireligious legislation. The 84th Congress passed a joint resolution \"declaring IN GOD WE TRUST the national motto of the United States\". The resolution passed both the House and the Senate unanimously and without debate. The law was signed by President Eisenhower on July 30, 1956. The United States Code at , now states: \"'In God we trust' is the national motto.\"",

            "document": "Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar . Sparked by low-mintage issues which appreciated in value, the market for United States commemorative coins spiked in 1936. Until 1954, the entire mintage of such issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market, and in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the coin collecting hobby, where they sought to purchase the new issues. Among the pieces which had recently been struck and had appreciated in value was the 1935 Old Spanish Trail half dollar. This piece had been issued at the behest of L. W. Hoffecker, a Texas entrepreneur and coin dealer, who put aside a fifth of the 10,000 mintage for himself and sold them well into the 1940s, by which time he had served as president of the American Numismatic Association (ANA). Congress authorized an explosion of commemorative coins in 1936; no fewer than fifteen were issued for the first time. At the request of the groups authorized to purchase them, several coins minted in prior years were produced again, dated 1936, senior among them the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar, first struck in 1926. Thomas G. Melish, a coin collector and entrepreneur from Cincinnati, came up with an idea for a commemorative coin that he would control and from which he could profit. Melish was a prominent businessman who had inherited the Bromwell Wire Company. He formed the Cincinnati Musical Center Commemorative Coin Association, and secured the introduction of H.R. 10264 on January 31, 1936. This bill would have provided for 10,000 coins from the Philadelphia Mint, 2,000 coins from Denver, and 3,000 from the San Francisco Mint. Such a low mintage would have made the Denver coin a significant rarity, increasing Melish's profit. On February 17, the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures recommended that it be amended to provide for a total of 15,000 coins without dictating at what mint or mints they should be struck. That committee, in its report accompanying the bill, noted that the piece was \"in commemoration of the fiftieth (golden) anniversary of Cincinnati, Ohio, as a center of music, and its contribution of the annual May festival to the art of music for the past 50 years.\" Melish, through political influence, was able to retain the provision that they should be struck \"at the mints\", allowing coinage at all three mints. This marked the last time that a coinage bill would pass Congress in the 1930s with that phrasing\u2014later issues were limited to a single mint.",

Assuming the probability of heads is the same as the probability of tails, then the entropy of the coin toss is as high as it could be. This is because there is no way to predict the outcome of the coin toss ahead of time: if we have to choose, the best we can do is predict that the coin will come up heads, and this prediction will be correct with probability 1/2. Such a coin toss has one bit of entropy since there are two possible outcomes that occur with equal probability, and learning the actual outcome contains one bit of information. In contrast, a coin toss using a coin that has two heads and no tails has zero entropy since the coin will always come up heads, and the outcome can be predicted perfectly. Analogously, one binary-outcome with equiprobable values has a Shannon entropy of formula_1 bit. Similarly, one trit with equiprobable values contains formula_2 (about 1.58496) bits of information because it can have one of three values.",
