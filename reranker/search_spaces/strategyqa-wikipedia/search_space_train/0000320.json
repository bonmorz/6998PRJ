Ballad of Easy Rider is the eighth album by the American rock band the Byrds and was released in November 1969 on Columbia Records (\"see\" 1969 in music). The album was named after the song \"Ballad of Easy Rider\", which had been written by the Byrds' guitarist and singer, Roger McGuinn (with help from Bob Dylan), as the theme song for the 1969 film, \"Easy Rider\". The title was also chosen in an attempt to capitalize on the commercial success of the film, although the majority of the music on the album had no connection with it. Nonetheless, the association with \"Easy Rider\" heightened the Byrds' public profile and resulted in \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" becoming the band's highest charting album for two years in the U.S.",

Recording sessions for \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" were produced by Terry Melcher, who had also worked as the Byrds' producer during 1965, on their \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" albums. The band decided to work with Melcher again as a result of their dissatisfaction with Bob Johnston's production on their previous album, \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\", and on their recent single, \"Lay Lady Lay\". Melcher was happy to accept the band's invitation to produce the album but his one stipulation was that he would also take on management duties for the Byrds, not wishing for a repeat of the conflict he had experienced with Jim Dickson, the group's original manager, in 1965. Melcher's return to the producer's chair began an association with the band that would last until \"Byrdmaniax\" in 1971, much longer than his first tenure as the Byrds' producer. In early 1969, the script writer and leading actor of \"Easy Rider\", Peter Fonda, asked Bob Dylan to compose a theme song for the film. Dylan declined but as a consolation he offered the lines - \"The river flows, it flows to the sea/Wherever that river goes, that's where I want to be/Flow, river, flow\" - which he hurriedly scribbled onto a napkin, before telling Fonda to \"give that to McGuinn.\" The fragment was dutifully passed on to the Byrds' guitarist, Roger McGuinn, who added his own lyrical and musical contributions to fashion a completed song, which he titled \"Ballad of Easy Rider\". After seeing a private screening of \"Easy Rider\" and realizing that he had been named as co-writer of the film's theme song, Dylan demanded that his writing credit be removed, leading McGuinn to theorize in later years that Dylan had disliked the film's ending and anti-hero motif. In 2000 McGuinn recounted to Jud Cost the story of how Dylan disowned credit for the song: \"I got a call from Dylan at three o'clock in the morning going 'What's this? I don't want this credit. Take it off.'\" Another possible reason for Dylan insisting that his name be removed from the song's credits may have been a suspicion that his name was being exploited to boost the film's credibility. Two versions of the song \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" were released. The first was the version included on the \"Easy Rider\" soundtrack album, which was listed as a solo performance by Roger McGuinn, although it also featured fellow Byrd Gene Parsons on harmonica. The second was the recording by the Byrds, which was included on the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album and released as a single. The version of the song found on the soundtrack album and used in the film is a completely different take to the version released by the Byrds.",

Musically the album consolidated and streamlined the band's country rock sound, consisting mostly of cover versions and traditional material, with three self-penned original songs. The first single to be released from the album was the title track, issued in October 1969 in America and reaching number 65 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. Composed primarily by McGuinn, with some input from Bob Dylan (although not credited), \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" was written as the theme tune for the 1969 countercultural film \"Easy Rider\". However the Byrds' recording of the song does not appear in the film, instead an acoustic version credited to McGuinn alone was used. However the Byrds' song \"Wasn't Born to Follow\" from \"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\" album was featured in \"Easy Rider\" and also included on the \"Easy Rider\" soundtrack album in August 1969. The Byrds' association with the film heightened their public profile and when the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album was released in November 1969, it peaked at number 36 in the U.S. and number 41 in the UK, becoming the band's highest charting album for two years in America. A second single taken from the album, \"Jesus Is Just Alright\", was released in December 1969 but it only managed to reach number 97. Despite this lack of commercial success, the Doobie Brothers' later hit version of \"Jesus Is Just Alright\" features an arrangement that was heavily influenced by the Byrds' recording. Just prior to the release of \"Ballad of Easy Rider\", the Byrds underwent yet another change in personnel when bassist John York was asked to leave the band in September 1969. York had become disenchanted with his role in the Byrds and had voiced his reluctance to perform material that had been written and recorded by the group before he had joined. The rest of the band had begun to doubt his commitment and so, a consensus was reached among the other three members that York should be fired. He was replaced, at the suggestion of Parsons and White, by Skip Battin, a freelance session musician and one-time member of the duo Skip & Flip. Battin's recruitment marked the last personnel change to the group for almost three years and as a result, the McGuinn\u2013White\u2013Parsons\u2013Battin line-up became the most stable and longest-lived of any configuration of the Byrds.",

Upon its release, the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album revived the Byrds' commercial fortunes, giving the band their first U.S. Top 40 album since \"Younger Than Yesterday\" in 1967. This renewed success was, in part, due to the band's public profile having been increased as a result of their involvement with \"Easy Rider\" and the inclusion of three Byrds-related songs on the film's soundtrack album. Columbia Records' was eager to capitalize on this new-found popularity and launched an advertising campaign for the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album, proclaiming \"The movie gave you the facts, the Ballad interprets them.\" However, with the exception of the title track, none of the songs on the album had much to do with the film. In fact, the album cover's sepia-toned photograph of Lemuel Parsons (Gene Parsons' father) sitting astride an archaic 1928 Harley-Davidson could almost be seen as a parody of the film's biker ethos.",

And while I wouldn't give up the time I spent in this band for anything, at this point it does not make sense for us to keep the band going any longer. The girls have become very busy with their other bands: Rachel full time w/Most Precious Blood, Vanessa w/Infidel (formerly Rebel Alliance), and Laura w/All for Nothing. Laura is also currently getting her Masters and working part-time, Vanessa is working, and I am currently working and traveling as a TV producer. Needless to say this has left us with very little time to dedicate to The Wage of Sin. We have so many amazing, dedicated fans asking us to play shows, do interviews, and be on compilations-anything to help our band out. While we are completely grateful and flattered that people are going out of their way to support us, I feel it is unfair for us to continue the band when the fans are currently dedicating more time than the actual members. There are so many other bands working their asses off, making huge sacrifices to write and play music to as many people as possible which deserve and need your support so much more than we do at this point. While we do have so much fun when we do play shows, unfortunately those moments are very few and far between lately. We have been lucky to have shared some wonderful experiences and are happy about the things we have accomplished together- releasing two CDs, touring the US and Europe, having a video on Headbangers Ball and Much Music, and most importantly having built friendships with the people we have met along the way. But being that we have all committed to touring with other bands or working for the rest of the year, we feel we would just be dragging on if we continued to go out this rate of trying to squeeze in shows on those rare occasions when our four worlds happen to collide and allow us to do so. To all of our fans, friends, anyone who has booked us, played with us, shared equipment with us, given us a place to stay, or cooked for us, and to the labels that have put out our music (Immigrant Sun, Beniihana, Burial, Elephant Eye, Kablio Muzika), and all our fill-ins (Bryan, Nick, Jerry, Chino) - we thank you so much for making our time in this band so amazing and for affording us so many great opportunities! Because this band is more than just the 4 people in it, we all felt it would be very unappreciative to NOT play some final shows. We want these shows to be THANK YOUs to everyone who has supported us, and final celebrations of the fun times we have had together these past few years. There are no bad feelings between us- we just all have our hearts in different places and support each other in each of our endeavors.

The Spekkens toy model is based on the knowledge balance principle: \"the number of questions about the physical state of a system that are answered must always be equal to the number that are unanswered in a state of maximal knowledge.\" However, the \"knowledge\" one can possess about a system must be carefully defined for this principle to have any meaning. To do this, the concept of a \"canonical\" set of yes or no questions is defined as the minimum number of questions needed. For example, for a system with 4 states, one can ask \"Is the system in state 1?\", \"Is the system in state 2?\" and \"Is the system in state 3?\" which would determine the state of the system (state 4 being the case if all three questions were answered \"No.\"). However, one could also ask \"Is the system in either state 1 or state 2?\" and \"Is the system in either state 1 or state 3?\", which would also uniquely determine the state, and has only two questions in the set. This set of questions is not unique, however it is clear that at least two questions (bits) are required to exactly represent one of four states. We say that for a system with 4 states, the number of questions in a canonical set is two. As such, in this case, the knowledge balance principle insists that the maximum number of questions in a canonical set that one can have answered at any given time is one, such that the amount of knowledge is equal to the amount of ignorance.",

Assume that annuities on 10,000 lives each ten years of age, which satisfy the Hm mortality table, have been purchased. Of these nominees 79 will die before attaining the age of 11, and no annuity payment will be made in respect of them; none will die between the ages of 11 and 12, so that annuities will be paid for one year on 9921 lives; 40 attain the age of 12 and die before 13, so that two payments will be made with respect to these lives. Reasoning in this way we see that the annuities on 35 of the nominees will be payable for three years; on 40 for four years, and so on. Proceeding thus to the end of the table, 15 nominees attain the age of 95, 5 of whom die before the age of 96, so that 85 payments will be paid in respect of these 5 lives. Of the survivors all die before attaining the age of 97, so that the annuities on these lives will be payable for 86 years. Having previously calculated a table of the values of annuities certain for every number of years up to 86, the value of all the annuities on the 10,000 nominees will be found by taking 40 times the value of an annuity for 2 years, 35 times the value of an annuity for 3 years, and so on\u2014the last term being the value of 10 annuities for 86 years\u2014and adding them together; and the value of an annuity on one of the nominees will then be found by dividing by 10,000. Before leaving the subject of De Witt, we may mention that we find in the correspondence a distinct suggestion of the law of mortality that bears the name of Demoivre. In De Witt's letter, dated 27 October 1671 (\"Ass.

We believe this brilliant series can and should continue, but we cannot produce future seasons under its current financial model. We are hopeful that we can reach an agreement with the voice cast that allows \"The Simpsons\" to go on entertaining audiences with original episodes for many years to come.\" One of the problems was that \"The Simpsons\" was possibly worth more cancelled than on the air. A 17-year-old syndication deal with local TV stations prohibits Fox from selling the show to cable networks. As long as \"The Simpsons\" still produces new episodes, Fox cannot break this deal. In the meantime, cable networks have grown to become just as big a market as the local TV stations. Another consideration was that Fox's parent company News Corporation was having meetings discussing the possibility of a cable channel that would only air \"The Simpsons\" episodes. Analysts consider a cancellation and subsequent second-run deal that includes cable networks to be worth $750 million. On this issue, Al Jean commented in an interview with \"TV Guide\" that \"It's a big company, and there are definitely people whose interests would have been better served by ending it.

The Piepers concluded that prevailing theories of child development did not offer adequate answers to the perennial questions posed by parents and mental health professionals. In their research, they addressed these questions, such as: What is a baby\u2019s basic nature at birth? How much happiness can humans rightfully expect? How and why does happiness transform itself into unhappiness? In the Piepers\u2019 words: \u201c\u2026 [W]e set out on our own to find answers that would allow us to be better parents and more effective professionals. We learned from the insights and dilemmas of the many parents we counseled, from our own clients, and from supervising the caseloads of other mental health professionals. We evaluated the results of the counsel we gave to parents and to foster care and adoption agencies. As another way of testing our ideas, we created and ran a successful treatment program for adolescent wards of the state who had been designated \u2018untreatable\u2019. Our research* and experience taught us that the emotional problems of children and adolescents couldn\u2019t be treated piecemeal or solely as individual behaviors that need to be modified. We found that troubled children are difficult to help because they have learned to need unhappiness. We saw that the real goal is to help troubled children turn away from needs for unhappiness as they rediscover the desires for positive relationship pleasure with which they were born,\". Intrapsychic Humanism was the result of this process.",

The first resolution of the Rota was that at any given debate a topic must be presented in printed form so that all could read it. From Samuel Pepys' diary we can see that these debates need not end at the first reading, but rather could and did spill over into other nights of debate. From the same journal entry we can also see evidence of the other resolutions being that the initially proposed topic was produced, given a full days time to consider, upon which Pepys says he \"heard [a] very good discourse; it was in answer to Mr. Harrington's answer.\" Further Pepys states that \"it was carried by ballot that it was a steady government; though, it is true by the voices, it had been carried before that it was an unsteady government. So tomorrow it is to be proved by the opponents...\" The cycle of the Rota Club then was sober consideration followed by debate and lastly voting.",

In which of the next five years it would be more fruitful to start a venture is a question many people ask. This question is generally answered on the basis of the birth horoscope, the dasha periods and transits. The question is, whether such pinpointed guidance and counselling can be further refined and put in sharp focus astrologically? ... The Tajika takes care of all those areas that are covered by the natal horoscopy. Thus it can reveal about health and disease, marriage, childbirth, income, expenditure, promotions, transfer, travel, rise and fall in career, imprisonment, death, etc. It is true to say that the Tajika cannot give what the birth horoscope does not promise. It is truer to say that the Tajika reveals, with greater clarity, the year in which the promise of the birth horoscope will be fulfilled.

The purpose of control at the strategic level is not to answer the question:' 'Have we made the right strategic choices at some time in the past?\" but rather \"How well are we doing now and how well will we be doing in the immediate future for which reliable information is available?\" The point is not to bring to light past errors but to identify needed corrections to steer the corporation in the desired direction. And this determination must be made with respect to currently desirable long-range goals and not against the goals or plans that were established at some time in the past. As with other control processes, strategic control processes are at their core cybernetic in nature: using one or more 'closed loop' controls to ensure that any observed deviations from expected activity or outcomes are highlighted to managers who can then intervene to correct / adjust the organisation's future activities. John Preble noted the need for these controls to be 'forward looking' when used to control strategy, to give controls that are \"future-directed and anticipatory\". Strategic control systems cannot \"...wait for a strategy to be executed before getting any feedback on how well it is working. Since this might take several years...\" A related concern for strategic control processes is the amount of time and effort required for the process to work: if either is too great the process will either be ineffective or be ignored by the organisation.",

What if we could reach a thousand people by doing this with audio? Oh my gosh that would be so wonderful... We are extreamly grateful to our audience... and are looking to bigger things from here\".

They were happy when they hit 200 listeners, but were ecstatic when they hit a thousand \"that was a huge psychological barrier for us\". The first big jump came after interviewing James Randi on the show, whom promoted the interview on the JREF website, which brought them up to about four thousand listeners. \"Now (year) our show is rebroadcast on XM and a few other stations, we are getting... over 200-250 thousand downloads a week.\" The first few months the podcast was not weekly, until they got more organized Steve decided that they were going to produce a show every week. \"The fact that I haven't missed a week in over six years is quite an incentive not to miss a week.\" Each live show is about 90 to 120 minutes long. Steve has to cut that down to about one hour 15 minutes for the broadcast show, and then get it down to exactly one hour for the XM show. He wonders what version people like more, the one hour version is much tighter but he has to cut out a lot of the banter and humor, while the 80 minute podcast show has much more personality.",

This question may seem trivial; however, think of a human like a computer. The question would then become: How does a computer take in any factual information without previous programming? Plato answered his own question by stating that knowledge is present at birth and all information learned by a person is merely a recollection of something the soul has already learned previously, which is called the Theory of Recollection or Platonic epistemology. This answer could be further justified by a paradox: If a person knows something, they don't need to question it, and if a person does not know something, they don't know to question it. Plato says that if one did not previously know something, then they cannot learn it. He describes learning as a passive process, where information and knowledge are ironed into the soul over time. However, Plato's theory elicits even more questions about knowledge: If we can only learn something when we already had the knowledge impressed onto our souls, then how did our souls gain that knowledge in the first place? Plato's theory can seem convoluted; however, his classical theory can still help us understand knowledge today.",

One of the largest problems facing the young Earth creationist theory is the starlight problem, which runs as follows: (1) there are galaxies billions of light-years from Earth, meaning it would take light from their stars billions of years to reach us; (2) we can see these galaxies, so their starlight has already arrived; (3) therefore the universe must be billions of years old. Alternative explanations are advanced by young Earth supporters. One is that God created starlight when he created the universe six thousand years ago and the age of distant starlight is skewed because the Bible refers to God stretching the universe (e.g. Isaiah 51:13.) Those who do not accept the biblical explanation of God stretching the universe consider the age of distant starlight as deceptive and the explanation is not entirely satisfactory, as the first implies a God who deceives. A second, posed by Barry Setterfield, states that the speed of light was faster in the past than it is now (the theory is called C-decay, from the cosmological symbol C representing the speed of light). Setterfield's theory, however, would produce consequences which have not been observed, and has been refuted by other creationists such as Russell Humphreys.",
