As the cinematic universe moves forward, you may start to see the cinematic universe adopt that same pattern, as the publishing has, where there's closure with some characters and new beginnings with other characters.\" He added that, for directors to \"fit\" in at Marvel, they must understand how to \"take a larger story and wrangle it into a moment\", yet keep it connected. On allowing directors and writers to work within Marvel's shared universe concept, Joe Russo said that Feige has \"big pieces that he knows he wants to build towards, but the way that you get there is open to interpretation and improv a little bit.\" For the Russos in \"The Winter Soldier\", they had to deal with the idea of S.H.I.E.L.D. being infiltrated by Hydra, with Joe saying, \"how we get there is all up to us. And I think why Marvel has been so successful is because it's been such a clear plan, that everything is interconnected and they're building emotional capital with each movie that you can then trade off of in the next film.\" Joe later elaborated that once each film's creative team \"come up with conceptually what we want to do\" for a film, then we will ask questions about whether this would interfere with a storyline in another movie. Or, what's going on in that film, can we pull some of that into this film? That's where you start looking for the interconnectedness, but it's very important early on that the concept be created in a bubble because you have to protect the idea, it has to be driven by storytelling.
