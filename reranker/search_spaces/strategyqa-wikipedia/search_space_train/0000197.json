To illustrate the absolute search for identity, the series writers created Adam, who is more truly alone than is anyone else. He is a creature assembled from a man, vampires, demons, and cutting edge cybernetic technology. Adam was not the first re-animated corpse to be presented in the series. \"Some Assembly Required\" in the second season also had a Frankenstein monster-like creation and \"Beauty and the Beasts\" in the third includes references to \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\"; both touch on the misuse or abuse of science. Adam is a clear reference to Frankenstein's monster, who in the novel \"Frankenstein\" (1818) tells his creator that he is the \"Adam of your labours\". Mary Shelley wrote the novel to highlight the problems progress, science, and industry create for humanity. Throughout the action, the monster constantly asks what he is and why he was created. Likewise, Adam escapes from 314 and makes his way out into the world, and much like Frankenstein's monster, he finds a little boy and asks the boy who and what he (Adam) is, then murders and dissects him. Adam is a curious character, seeking the truth and pontificating on what he has learned, even if he gained the knowledge through heartless violence. Whedon wanted Adam to be inquisitive and introspective, directing George Hertzberg to \"find the stillness\" in the character. Roz Kaveney notes that Hertzberg's \"flawed but impressive performance\" includes Adam's interesting idiosyncrasy of pausing each time he speaks, as if he is creating meaning with his own words and must consider the implications of what he is saying. Author Nikki Stafford connects Adam's need to learn about the world around him to Frankenstein's monster: Adam must understand why other people are here and why he has emotions, a peculiarity of his creation as Dr. Walsh never encouraged others to question her. One Buffy studies writer draws comparisons between Dr. Walsh and Victor Frankenstein, both of whom build monsters out of body parts \"to compensate for human vulnerability\". The moral of Shelley's novel is that what science can accomplish is not necessarily what it should.",

After the change of directors to James Whale, along with a major script and conceptual revision, the virtually unknown Boris Karloff was then cast in his star-making role.

The monster breaks down the door, throws her around, and stomps off with her body as well as carrying the red-headed female doll earlier found in the yurt.",

Although Frankenstein's hunchbacked assistant is often referred to as \"Igor\" in descriptions of the films, he is not so called in the earliest films. In both \"Frankenstein\" and \"Bride of Frankenstein\", Frankenstein has an assistant who is played both times by Dwight Frye who is crippled. In the original 1931 film the character is named \"Fritz\" who is hunchbacked and walks with the aid of a small cane. In \"Bride of Frankenstein\", Frye plays \"Karl\" a murderer who stands upright but has a lumbering metal brace on both legs that can be heard clicking loudly with every step. Both characters would be killed by Karloff's monster in their respective films. It was not until \"Son of Frankenstein\" (1939) that a character called \"Ygor\" first appears (here played by Bela Lugosi and revived by Lugosi in \"The Ghost of Frankenstein\" (1942) after his apparent murder in the earlier film). This character \u2014 a deranged blacksmith whose neck was broken and twisted due to a botched hanging \u2014 befriends the monster and later helps Dr. Wolf Frankenstein, leading to the \"hunchbacked assistant\" called \"Igor\" commonly associated with \"Frankenstein\" in popular culture. Frye also appears in later films in the series, such as in \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man\" (1943).",

Buffy was created to subvert the media trope of a young, petite girl who easily falls prey to a male monster. Resisting patriarchy is exhibited in Buffy's opposing the first season's Master (Mark Metcalf), the leader of a cult determined to cause the apocalypse, and again in the third season where exploring the issues of power and its abuse is a primary theme. Buffy opposes Sunnydale's secretly evil Mayor (Harry Groener), who is planning to transform into a giant demon and feed on the graduating class of Sunnydale High School. The military-industrial complex is at the heart of the authority question in season four, again drawing comparisons to \"Frankenstein\". Where Frankenstein's monster had no parental love, Adam has a \"design flaw\". Unlike Frankenstein's monster, who needs his creator to make him a mate, Adam supplants Dr. Walsh's existence with technology, finding her unnecessary and thus he kills her. Adam is the embodiment of the lack of moral guidance in pursuing scientific and technological advancement. He represents the cannibalistic nature of relentless and unchecked power: what that power wreaks comes back to devour its source. \"Buffy\", however, subverts Shelley's novel in the way Adam is defeated. Both Frankenstein and the monster must suffer alone. \"Frankenstein\" itself is an inversion of the Romantic era ideal of a solitary hero who must endure struggles, by portraying the monster and its creator as isolated and miserable. Buffy, as the embodiment of the postfeminist Romantic hero, further subverts this because the source of her success, according to Anita Rose, is that she fights with friends. Only then is she able to defeat Adam.",

He also wrote a version of what was essentially a previously-known thought experiment, the experience machine, in an attempt to show that ethical hedonism was false. Nozick asked us to imagine that \"superduper neuropsychologists\" have figured out a way to stimulate a person's brain to induce pleasurable experiences. We would not be able to tell that these experiences were not real. He asks us, if we were given the choice, would we choose a machine-induced experience of a wonderful life over real life? Nozick says no, then asks whether we have reasons not to plug into the machine and concludes that since it does not seem to be rational to plug in, ethical hedonism must be false.",
