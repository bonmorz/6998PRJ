His name is not revealed in the series until the Season 8 finale when, upon J.D.'s first time asking about it, he simply says his name is Glenn Matthews. This is also speculated to be false for two reasons: first, after J.D. leaves the shot, an orderly addresses the Janitor as \"Tommy\"; and second, while watching \"The Fugitive\" with Carla and Danni (Dr. Cox's sister-in-law, played by Tara Reid) in the Season 3 episode 'My Friend The Doctor', J.D. notices the real-life Flynn's character in the train scene. When the Janitor confirms he was in the movie at the end of the episode, some speculated the Janitor's real name in \"Scrubs\" is actually Neil Flynn. Flynn was a series regular with \"Scrubs\" through the first eight seasons.

            "document": "Ground sloth . Radiocarbon dating places the disappearance of ground sloths in the United States at around 11,000 years ago. The Shasta ground sloth visited Rampart Cave in the Grand Canyon seasonally, leaving behind a massive stratified dung deposit, and seemed to be flourishing during the period of 13,000 to 11,000 BP, when the deposition suddenly stopped. Steadman \"et al.\" argue that it is no coincidence that studies have shown that ground sloths disappeared from an area a few years after the arrival of humans. Trackways preserved in New Mexico (probably dating from between 10 to 15.6 thousand years ago) that appear to show a group of humans chasing or harassing three \"Nothrotheriops\" or \"Paramylodon\" ground sloths may record the scene of a hunt. The tracks are interpreted as showing seven instances of a sloth turning and rearing up on its hind legs to confront its pursuers, while the humans approach from multiple directions, possibly in an attempt to distract it.",

            "document": "Ice Age (2002 film) . Originally, Sid the sloth was supposed to be a con-artist and a hustler, and there was even finished scene of the character conning some aardvark kids. His character was later changed to a talkative-clumsy sloth because the team felt the audience would have hated him. There was also an alternate scene of Sid in the hottub with the ladies which shows him saying to them \"Let's jump in the gene pool and see what happens.\" One of the female sloths then kicks him in the groin. This was cut because it was not suitable for children and may have gotten the film a PG-13 rating. Other innuendos with Sid were also cut from the film. Sid was also supposed to have a female sloth named Sylvia (voiced by Kristen Johnston) chasing after him, whom he despised and kept ditching. All the removed scenes can be seen on the DVD.",
