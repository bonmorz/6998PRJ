Susan, who grows to be 49 feet 11 inches tall, was inspired by \"Attack of the 50 Foot Woman\".

Insectosaurus, a 350-foot-tall monster, is a nod to the 1961 Japanese film \"Mothra\". According to Vernon, the Missing Link has no direct inspiration. He \"just represents anything prehistoric that comes back to life and terrorizes people.\" For the San Francisco sequence, the producers researched lots of films and photographs for an accurate depiction of the city, and filmed animator Line Andersen, who had a similar body type to Ginormica\u2014tall, thin, and athletic-looking\u2014walking alongside a scale model of San Francisco, to capture better how a person not comfortable with being too big with an environment would walk around it.",

Lugosi suffered exhaustion at some point during the filming, and his absence from the set, combined with his physical limitations at age sixty, required the liberal use of stand-ins. Stuntman Gil Perkins allegedly portrayed the Monster in the character's first scene (thirty-five minutes into the film) and during much of the monsters' fight (conclusive documentation needed). Although a still exists of Lugosi in the ice, when viewers see the Monster for the first time (including closeups), it is actually the stunt double Perkins. Stuntman Eddie Parker is usually credited as Lugosi's sole double, but his primary stunt role was thought to be that of the Wolf Man. However, he does appear as the Monster in at least one shot, and yet a possible third stuntman also stands in for Lugosi in two brief sequences. The edited result unfairly suggests that Lugosi had to be doubled even in non-strenuous scenes, and the multiple use of alternating stuntmen in both closeups and medium shots damages the continuity of Lugosi's characterization. As an example, the doubles in the fight scene stiffen their arms, even though that was a cautious habit of the previously-blind Monster; for instance, a medium shot shows Lugosi pulling down a cabinet with his arms naturally bent at the elbows, but the next shot is of a double completing the task with straightened arms.",

The east face shows two wrestling beak-headed monsters with tails and prominent genitals, above which is a hooded rider astride an oversized horse, and then a large monster gripping a snake in its jaws and linked by its tail and crest to a cruciform group of four animals at the top of the shaft. The decoration on the west face is damaged, but two squatting beasts can be seen with interpenetrating necks and large heads.",

            "document": "Dr. Black, Mr. Hyde . Grunzke also argues that \"Dr. Black, Mr. Hyde\" provides commentary on evolutionary arguments for slavery by depicting Pride-as-Hyde with \"ape-like features, body hair and the like.\" Being more akin to a Frankenstein monster than a Mr. Hyde, Pride is capitalizing on \"the ways that the Frankenstein narrative was embraced by the African American community to turn the tables on this misguided Darwinist argument\" - that misguided argument being that African Americans were inferior and thus should be enslaved. By appearing as a white man to the other characters, it appears that Crain is attempting to depict the white man in a black world as being bestial By being more Frankenstein-esque, Pride gains sympathy from the audience as he struggles with being in an unknown world - despite being white when he is Mr. Hyde. Grunzke's argument stems from Elizabeth Young's argument in her book, \"Black Frankenstein: The Making of an American Metaphor\". In Young's book, she argues that the Frankenstein monster \"refuses to accept his placelessness\". The idea of the Frankenstein monster can be appropriated to African Americans as an idea where the monster is placed in an unknown land and society, and he must react violently to escape the treachery of that society. That metaphor is embraced by the African American community because of how they were forced into a society where they were treated as monsters. In the case of this film,however, the monster is a white man navigating a black world in Watts. The metaphor of the film is complicated further as it is a monster who changes from being black to white.",

            "document": "Adam (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) . Buffy studies scholar Roz Kaveney states that estrangement from the self and others is the primary theme of the fourth season. To illustrate the absolute search for identity, the series writers created Adam, who is more truly alone than is anyone else. He is a creature assembled from a man, vampires, demons, and cutting edge cybernetic technology. Adam was not the first re-animated corpse to be presented in the series. \"Some Assembly Required\" in the second season also had a Frankenstein monster-like creation and \"Beauty and the Beasts\" in the third includes references to \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\"; both touch on the misuse or abuse of science. Adam is a clear reference to Frankenstein's monster, who in the novel \"Frankenstein\" (1818) tells his creator that he is the \"Adam of your labours\". Mary Shelley wrote the novel to highlight the problems progress, science, and industry create for humanity. Throughout the action, the monster constantly asks what he is and why he was created. Likewise, Adam escapes from 314 and makes his way out into the world, and much like Frankenstein's monster, he finds a little boy and asks the boy who and what he (Adam) is, then murders and dissects him. Adam is a curious character, seeking the truth and pontificating on what he has learned, even if he gained the knowledge through heartless violence. Whedon wanted Adam to be inquisitive and introspective, directing George Hertzberg to \"find the stillness\" in the character. Roz Kaveney notes that Hertzberg's \"flawed but impressive performance\" includes Adam's interesting idiosyncrasy of pausing each time he speaks, as if he is creating meaning with his own words and must consider the implications of what he is saying. Author Nikki Stafford connects Adam's need to learn about the world around him to Frankenstein's monster: Adam must understand why other people are here and why he has emotions, a peculiarity of his creation as Dr. Walsh never encouraged others to question her. One Buffy studies writer draws comparisons between Dr. Walsh and Victor Frankenstein, both of whom build monsters out of body parts \"to compensate for human vulnerability\". The moral of Shelley's novel is that what science can accomplish is not necessarily what it should.",

            "document": "Adam (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) . Questioning tradition and authority, specifically institutional authority, is a repeated theme on the show. Buffy was created to subvert the media trope of a young, petite girl who easily falls prey to a male monster. Resisting patriarchy is exhibited in Buffy's opposing the first season's Master (Mark Metcalf), the leader of a cult determined to cause the apocalypse, and again in the third season where exploring the issues of power and its abuse is a primary theme. Buffy opposes Sunnydale's secretly evil Mayor (Harry Groener), who is planning to transform into a giant demon and feed on the graduating class of Sunnydale High School. The military-industrial complex is at the heart of the authority question in season four, again drawing comparisons to \"Frankenstein\". Where Frankenstein's monster had no parental love, Adam has a \"design flaw\". Unlike Frankenstein's monster, who needs his creator to make him a mate, Adam supplants Dr. Walsh's existence with technology, finding her unnecessary and thus he kills her. Adam is the embodiment of the lack of moral guidance in pursuing scientific and technological advancement. He represents the cannibalistic nature of relentless and unchecked power: what that power wreaks comes back to devour its source. \"Buffy\", however, subverts Shelley's novel in the way Adam is defeated. Both Frankenstein and the monster must suffer alone. \"Frankenstein\" itself is an inversion of the Romantic era ideal of a solitary hero who must endure struggles, by portraying the monster and its creator as isolated and miserable. Buffy, as the embodiment of the postfeminist Romantic hero, further subverts this because the source of her success, according to Anita Rose, is that she fights with friends. Only then is she able to defeat Adam.",
