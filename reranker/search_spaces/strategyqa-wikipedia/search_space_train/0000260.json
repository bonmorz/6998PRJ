He sculpted the creature's body using plasticine, incorporating pieces such as vertebrae from snakes and cooling tubes from a Rolls-Royce. The creature's head was manufactured separately by Carlo Rambaldi, who had worked on the aliens in \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". Rambaldi followed Giger's designs closely, making some modifications in order to incorporate the moving parts which would animate the jaw and inner mouth. A system of hinges and cables was used to operate the creature's rigid tongue, which protruded from its mouth and featured a second mouth at its tip with its own set of movable teeth. The final head had about 900 moving parts and points of articulation. Part of a human skull was used as the \"face\", and was hidden under the smooth, translucent cover of the head. Rambaldi's original Alien jaw is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution, while in April 2007 the original Alien suit was sold at auction. Copious amounts of K-Y Jelly were used to simulate saliva and to give the Alien an overall slimy appearance. The creature's vocalizations were provided by Percy Edwards, a voice artist famous for providing bird sounds for British television throughout the 1960s and 1970s as well as the whale sounds for \"Orca: Killer Whale\" (1977).",

Giger also gave the Alien's mouth a second inner set of pharyngeal jaws located at the tip of a long, tongue-like proboscis which could extend rapidly for use as a weapon. His design for the creature was heavily influenced by an aesthetic he had created and termed \"biomechanical\", a fusion of the organic and the mechanic. His mock-up of the Alien was created using parts from an old Rolls Royce car, rib bones and the vertebrae from a snake, molded with plasticine. The Alien's animatronic head, which contained 900 moving parts, was designed and constructed by special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. Giger and Rambaldi together would win the 1980 Academy Award for Visual Effects for their design of the Alien. Scott decided on the man-in-suit approach for creating the creature onscreen. Initially circus performers were tried, then multiple actors together in the same costume, but neither proved scary. Deciding that the creature would be scarier the closer it appeared to a human, Scott decided that a single, very tall, very thin man be used. Scott was inspired by a photograph of Leni Riefenstahl standing next to a 6'4\" (1.93 m) Nubian. The casting director found 6'10\" (2.08 m), rail-thin graphic designer Bolaji Badejo in a local pub.

As animals, we are genetically almost identical to our Stone Age ancestors. We live in advanced societies, with supermarkets and cars and lifts, but we are built to be hunter-gatherers. We are programmed to seek out fat, sugar, starch and salt, because, in the Stone Age, these things were hard to come by. When they turn up in abundance, our bodies, for the most part, can't say no.  . . . to put it simply, human beings are evolving much more slowly than the food we eat. And the food is tricking us. We think it's what we need, but it's just what we want. What can we do? Eat sensibly and exercise, of course. One thing we have to do, though, is not to \u201clisten to your body\" \u2013 because it craves food that, in abundance, is bad for it. . .

Happiness in life then, includes the virtues, and Aristotle adds that it would include self-sufficiency (\"autarkeia\"), not the self-sufficiency of a hermit, but of someone with a family, friends and community. By itself this would make life choiceworthy and lacking nothing. To describe more clearly what happiness is like, Aristotle next asks what the work (\"ergon\") of a human is. All living things have nutrition and growth as a work, all animals (according to the definition of animal Aristotle used) would have perceiving as part of their work, but what is more particularly human? The answer according to Aristotle is that it must involve articulate speech (logos), including both being open to persuasion by reasoning, and thinking things through. Not only will human happiness involve reason, but it will also be an active being-at-work (energeia), not just potential happiness. And it will be over a lifetime, because \"one swallow does not make a spring\". The definition given is therefore: And because happiness is being described as a work or function of humans, we can say that just as we contrast harpists with serious harpists, the person who lives well and beautifully in this actively rational and virtuous way will be a \"serious\" (\"spoudaios\") human.",

He notices first that \u2018man is a biological being with a physical body\u2019, which is the \u2018less than God\u2019, as we think of \u2018God as a being of pure spirit, lifted above the categories of time and space\u2019. The psalmist would then say that God made man that way, and because of this \u2018there is nothing wrong with it\u2019 and that \u2018everything God makes is good; therefore there is nothing wrong with it\u2019. The Greeks, as King informs us, \u2018felt the body was evil\u2019 and that the \u2018soul could never reach its full maturity until it broke loose from the prison of the body\u2019. However, Christianity raises the view that \u2018the body is not the principle of evil; it says the will is the principle of evil\u2019. He then defines that in \u2018any doctrine of man, we must be concerned with man's physical well being\u2019. To support this he brings up Jesus` quote that we need the \u201cbread\u201d to survive and also states \u2018this isn\u2019t the only part\u2019 and if we stop here we would see \u2018man merely as an animal\u2019. He then brings an example of chemists who calculated that the values of man came to \u2018about ninety-eight cents\u2019, today with our living standards it comes to \u2018a dollar ninety eight for the average man\u2019. King challenges this idea by questioning \u2018But can we explain the whole of man in terms of ninety eight cents?\u2019 and brings up examples of human genius; and again asks \u2018Can we explain the mystery of the human soul in terms of ninety eight cents?\u2019 To this he answers \u201cno\u201d and states that \u2018man is a child of God\u2019 and raises the second basic point of the doctrine \u2018that man is a being of spirit\u2019, which is the \u2018thou has crowned him with glory and honour\u2019, and because of our \u2018rational capacity, man has a mind, man can reason. This distinguishes us from the lower animals\u2019. King then defines man as \u2018God\u2019s marvellous creation. Through his mind he can leap oceans, break through walls, and transcend the categories of time and space\u2019. With this he defines what the biblical writers meant when they said \u2018man is made in the image of God\u2019, and that he has \u2018rational capacity; he has the unique ability to have a fellowship with God. Man is a being of spirit\u2019.",

He is considered the 'heart and tongue' of Ra, and the means by which Ra's will is translated into speech. An Augur, or priest of Ancient Rome, was said to be able to interpret 'the will of the Gods' by reading the behaviour of birds. While Native Americans, renowned for their understanding of the natural world and their reverence for it, relied upon the eagle, to take their prayers to the Great Spirit. We need only remind ourselves of the recent devastation caused by avian influenza to gain an appreciation what is at stake in our relationship with these small garden birds. It is symptomatic of our relationship with the natural world itself. As Mark Cocker in his review of these pieces, writes: It may seem absurd today. But perhaps we should reflect that in 1997 the Labour government offered a series of indices to measure the quality of life in this country. One of those yardsticks for the good life in Britain was bird populations. We are all now familiar how birds act as indicators for the quality of our environment. The owl, whose cry pierces the darkness, or the kestrel which wrestles the wind to a standstill at the motorway verge, will only survive if the trees, the insects, the other animals, the flowers and the countryside itself are all present and correct. In \"An Exchange of Information\" the distinct nature of the materials used for the different parts of the sculpture, appears to underpin the distance between human beings and birds in modern life.",

What our forebears lacked was a full understanding of the extent to which our welfare depends upon the health of the global ecosystem and the extent to which our evolutionary cousins can be hurt, harmed and injured in ways analogous to ourselves. The question before us is not simply \"how may we produce the greatest ratio of pleasure to pain\" (a wholly vacuous program), nor yet \"what rights do creatures have before the community formulates them,\" but how may we best order the communities (social and global) of which we are parts? The answer, I believe, must lie in our taking seriously what we already know, that more matters even to animals than their own plain or pleasure, and that our survival even as a species depends upon being able to maintain or create substantial and civil ecosystems at household, civil, national and global levels.",

Because of these two modes of knowing, we can appear to be very knowledgeable about the grammar of a particular language or grammar in general and yet be very poor users of that language. Or, like many native speakers, we can make metalinguistic assertions about the rules of our language which are not at all borne out by the way we actually speak and comprehend our mother tongue. Knowledge of a language, in this metalinguistic sense of the word, can also be \"right\" or \"wrong\". We can have misconceptions about language, or we can have a view of grammar that accords with the facts. By way of contrast, the system operated subconsciously within our language module can never be right or wrong: it is just the way it is, the way it as has developed in us over time. Metalinguistic knowledge is not useless, however. An essential part of education in many cultures is acquiring such consciously-accessible knowledge about language, and especially about the mother tongue. In MOGUL, however, this should not be confused with the implicit knowledge of language that drives language performance.",

            "document": "Trace (deconstruction) . However, now that we are done discussing this Derridian strategy, let us get back to the concept of sous rature. To understand it properly, we need to learn about Heidegger's existentialist theories. In doing so, we will also explore the link between existentialism and structuralism. Heidegger said that the possibility of 'being', or what he called \"Dasein\" (meaning being-there), is the presupposition behind any definition, any defined entity. He comes to this decision through the general problem of definition: if anything is to be defined as an entity, then the question of Being, in general, have to be answered affirmatively at first. Before we can think and decide that something exists, we must acknowledge the fact that anything can be. This Being is not an answer to a question, as it predates any thought, or possibility of thought: if the subject of your thought \"exists\", then the Being is always-already there. Yet, Heidegger refuses the metaphysicality of the word \"Being\", and tries to keep it to the human realm by crossing it out. When Heidegger puts \"Being\" before all concepts, he is trying to put an end to a certain trend of Western philosophy that is obsessed about the origin, and by the same token, the end. Putting \"Being\" under erasure is an attempt by Heidegger to save his concept of \"Being\" from becoming the metaphysical origin and the eschatological end of all entities. Yet, by making \"Dasein\" or \"Being\" his master-word, his function-word, Heidegger, nonetheless, fails to do so. Heidegger's concept of \"Dasein\" is similar to the Structuralist concept of the 'signified'. To put it simply, in Structuralism, all signifiers are directly connected to an extra-linguistic signified, the invariable ones. To 'mean' anything, a signifier must presuppose a signified already-always outside it. This is what Derrida terms as the \"transcendental signified\": as a signified, it belongs to the realm of language, but by being invariable, and by refusing any movement, it remains outside it [A word, if immovable, can mean nothing, or even exist. Only when an endless chain of other signifiers, other words, hints, get associated with it, it finally acquires meaning ('Camel' is understandable only when it is thinly associated with many related words, such as 'animal', 'desert', 'cigarette', 'long neck etc). In other words, language is this movement]. Dasein, by being under the erasure, claims to remain in the realm of physicality, but by being prior and anterior to any entity, and any thought, it remains outside them. In short, Heidegger's idea of \"Dasein\" fails to overcome the metaphysical trap. Derrida takes almost a similar strategy. But in his case, he puts the concept of \"trace\" under erasure. Trace, unlike \"Dasein\", is the absence of the presence, never itself the Master-word; it is the radically \"other\", it plays within a certain structure of difference. To Derrida, sign is the play of identity and difference; half of the sign is always \"not there\", and another half \"not that\" [We define everything negatively, a chair is 'not' a table, 'not' five-legged, one-legged, 'not' animate, 'not' of flesh. For detailed discussion, check Ferdinand de Saussure. The sign never leads to the extra-linguistic thing, it leads to another sign, one substituting the other playfully inside the structure of language. We do not feel the presence of a thing through a sign, but through the absence of other presences, we guess what it is. To Derrida, trace and not \"being-there\", difference and not-identity, create meaning inside language. This is the main difference between Heideggerian Dasein and Derridian trace.",

We ask ourselves if Thomas, who has recently been betrayed by his girlfriend Ffion, believes that it is possible that the relationship can continue. The way we can find out the answer to this question is simply by asking Thomas if he believes it is possible. Thomas says no. Does this authorize us to attribute to Thomas the belief that the relationship cannot continue? Of course not, since Thomas is probably angry and confuses his desire to break up with Ffion with his beliefs. So we ask him if he is angry with Ffion. He says that he is, but we cannot attribute to him the belief that the relationship \"can\" continue, because we don't really know if he's confusing his desires with his beliefs or vice versa. So now we ask Thomas if he will still retain the same opinion next month. Thomas pauses for a while and then says yes. At this point, we think we have a definitive confirmation of the fact that Thomas believes that the relation must be interrupted, since he reflected on the matter before answering. Just to be sure, we ask him what came to mind during that interval of reflection. Thomas answers that he thought of all the unhappy incidents between that took place between him and Ffion. So we return to our original hypothesis on the basis that Thomas is angry and therefore confuses his desires and his beliefs.",
