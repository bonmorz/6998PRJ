Before becoming the current host of the show, Alfonso Ribeiro made his first (and final) guest appearance in the studio on a season 25 episode of AFV playing one of the show's audience participation games with then-host Tom Bergeron called \"Who's Makin' That Racket?\". While some of the Tom Bergeron-era clip segments, the in-studio audience, and background parts of the Tom Bergeron-era set props remained intact and/or continued to air for Alfonso Ribeiro's first three seasons, the stage featured a floor layout and stairway connected to a rubics-like cube with flat-screen TVs and new segments (especially for Alfonso Ribiero's run) continued to be added and aired on the show. The Assignment America and musical montage segments that started in the Bob Saget-era and the honorable mentions segments and Disney Grand Prize Vacation Sweepstakes Contests that started in the Tom Bergeron-era also continued.",

His early roles at the station included being a contributor on \"Evening Magazine\" (1982\u201387), and hosting brief informational and show preview segments known as \"4 Today\", every 30 minutes during WBZ's daytime lineup (1983\u201387).

In the final six seasons of Tom Bergeron's run as host, the show started its \"Funny Since 1989\" campaign in 2009 and had two anniversary seasons. Season 20, in 2009, had a special 20th anniversary episode that aired on November 29, 2009. The special brought back Bob Saget to AFV for the first time in 12 years as a guest. Both Saget and Bergeron ended that episode with a pinata party skit and a nod to the Star Wars lightsaber fight scenes when the credits started rolling. The pinatas resembled the looks of the two hosts. Five years later, on March 7, 2014, Bergeron announced on his Twitter account that season 25 would be his last. AFV aired a 25th Anniversary Celebrity Celebration special in February 2015. Bergeron's final new episode from his in-studio stage home of 15 years (which was really his second to final episode) aired on May 10, 2015 (and for the final time in rerun form on ABC on September 13, 2015), and was the final (and season 25's second) $100,000 show of his tenure and featured at different times of the episode a look back at classic and modern funny home videos that defined the show's then-25-year run. Bergeron's \"real\" final new episode aired on May 17, 2015, the season finale, ending his run as host after fifteen seasons (the longest hosting tenure for the series to date). The episode \u2013 taped on-location at Disneyland for that season's edition of the annual \"Grand Prize Spectacular\", AFV's 25th anniversary, and the Disneyland Resort's 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration that began on May 22, 2015 (which has appeared in various formats since 2005, in which one of the two (formerly three) $100,000 winners from the current season wins a Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, or in earlier seasons, an Adventures by Disney vacation package) \u2013 featured an auto-tuned montage of clips and outtakes from Bergeron's run as host and closed with him being escorted after walking off the outdoor stage near Sleeping Beauty Castle following the grand prize presentation on a cart driven by original host Bob Saget in a special cameo appearance. ABC aired encores of this episode on two different occasions.

They traveled around England as drama was the most entertaining art at the time. As a boy player, many skills had to be implemented such as voice and athleticism (fencing was one). Stronger female roles in tragedies were acted by older boy players because they had the experience. Elizabethan actors never played the same show on successive days and added a new play to their repertoire every other week. These actors were getting paid within these troupes so for their job, they would constantly learn new plays as they toured different cities in England. In these plays, there were bookkeepers that acted as the narrators of these plays and they would introduce the actors and the different roles they played. At some points, the bookkeeper wouldn\u2019t state the narrative of the scene, so the audience could find out for themselves. In Elizabethan and Jacobean plays, the plays often exceeded the number of characters/roles and didn\u2019t have enough actors to fulfill them, thus the idea of doubling roles came to be. Doubling roles is used to reinforce a plays theme by having the actor act out the different roles simultaneously. The reason for this was for the acting companies to control salary costs, or to be able to perform under conditions where resources such as other actor companies lending actors were not present. There are two acting styles implemented. Formal and natural. Formal acting is objective and traditional, natural acting attempts to create an illusion for the audience by remaining in character and imitating the fictional circumstances. The formal actor symbolizes while the natural actor interprets. The natural actor impersonates while the formal actor represents the role. Natural and formal are opposites of each other, where natural acting is subjective. Overall, the use of these acting styles and the doubled roles dramatic device made Elizabethan plays very popular.",

In his system the doctrine of duty is the description of the method of the attainment of ethical ends, the conception of duty as an imperative, or obligation, being excluded, as we have seen. No action fulfills the conditions of duty except as it combines the three following antitheses: reference to the moral idea in its whole extent and likewise to a definite moral sphere; connection with existing conditions and at the same time absolute personal production; the fulfillment of the entire moral vocation every moment though it can only be done in a definite sphere. Duties are divided with reference to the principle that every man make his own the entire moral problem and act at the same time in an existing moral society. This condition gives four general classes of duty: duties of general association or duties with reference to the community (\"Rechtspflicht\"), and duties of vocation (\"Berufspflicht\") \u2014 both with a universal reference, duties of the conscience (in which the individual is sole judge), and duties of love or of personal association.",

Since 1999, she has appeared on the show in a recurring capacity, often doing double duty between \"Days\" and \"Y&R\", in one case appearing on both shows on the very same day, a feat possible because of their different shooting and airing schedules.",

            "document": "Granite State Challenge . High schools from around the state compete against each other to win \"brainy bragging rights\" and grant money for their school. The first season of the program was hosted by Tom Bergeron (now of America's Funniest Home Videos and Dancing with the Stars fame), one of Bergeron's first jobs appearing on television. Starting in the second season and continuing to today, Jim Jeannotte took over hosting duties. Co-host Lori Warriner interviews the team members, coaches, and school administration. Prior co-hosts include Tim Estiloz, John Herman, and Alison MacNair (former host of NHPTV's NH Outlook). The competition features 16 teams in a single elimination tournament competing in half-hour shows that are pretaped over a few weeks and air through the broadcast season. The program previously selected 32 teams to compete on the televised rounds based on state geography and recent appearances; however, after a year-long hiatus, the program required interested teams to complete a written test, with the top-scoring sixteen teams earning spots. The championship game is called the Superchallenge. Since 1995, part of the funding for Granite State Challenge comes from proceeds of the New Hampshire Lottery Commission. Unitil_Corporation is also one of the show's primary sponsors. Beginning in 2008, each episode is available to view on YouTube and to download at no charge on iTunes. Since 2012/2013, the winners of the NHPTV Granite State Challenge faces off against the WGBH High School Quiz Show Champions for a trophy called the \"Governors Cup\". Since the Governor's Cup started, New Hampshire (NHPTV) has 2 wins and Massachusetts (WGBH) has three wins.",

Optical doubles are so called because the two stars appear close together in the sky as seen from the Earth; they are almost on the same . Nevertheless, their \"doubleness\" depends only on this optical effect; the stars themselves are distant from one another and share no physical connection. A double star can be revealed as optical by means of differences in their parallax measurements, proper motions, or radial velocities. Most known double stars have not been studied sufficiently closely to determine whether they are optical doubles or they are doubles physically bound through gravitation into a multiple star system.",

The Court of Appeal rejected the High Court's textual interpretation of Article 49(1) because it failed to see how the presence of absence of the word \"an\" could resolve the questions. The Court believed that even if the word \"election\" was describing a process, this interpretation on its own would not answer the question of whether the Prime Minister had unfettered discretion. As such, the omission or inclusion of the word \"an\" did not add value to the understanding of Article 49(1), given that the phrase \"shall be filled by election\" was not any clearer than \"shall be filled by an election\" in determining the issue. Further, the phrase \"shall be filled by election\" is capable of being read in a \"double-barrelled sense\", meaning that it could in fact refer to both an event and process at the same time.",
