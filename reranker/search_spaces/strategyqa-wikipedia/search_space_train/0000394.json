Whitehurst wanted to study the shape of the earth by measuring differences in gravitation. For this, he studied heavy pendulums in different locations. He measured the length of the pendulum, the frequency of its oscillation and the length of the path its head was moving. He compared these to theoretical values he calculated assuming the globe is spherical. Starting on the assumption that the length of a second pendulum in the latitude of London was 39.2\u00a0inches, he deduced that the length of one oscillating 42 times a minute is 80 inches, while that of one oscillating twice as many times is 20 inches. The difference between these two lengths would therefore be exactly 5 feet. He found upon experiment that the actual difference was only 59.892\u00a0inches owing to the real length of the pendulum, oscillating once a second, being 39.125\u00a0inches. He obtained rough data, from which the true lengths of pendulums, the spaces through which heavy bodies fall in a given time, and many other particulars relating to the force of gravitation and the true figure of the earth could be deduced.",

Instead, they are covered by tough skin and a layer of coarse hair. The vertebrae attach to the carapace. The claws on the middle toes of the forefeet are elongated for digging, though not to the same degree as those of the much larger giant armadillo of South America. Their low metabolic rate and poor thermoregulation make them best suited for semitropical environments. Unlike the South American three-banded armadillos, the nine-banded armadillo cannot roll itself into a ball. It is, however, capable of floating across rivers by inflating its intestines, or by sinking and running across riverbeds.

Based on a 40-year data set of more than 50 giant squid specimens, Roper & Shea (2013:114) suggest an average total length at maturity of and a \"rarely encountered maximum length\" of . Of the nearly 100 specimens examined by Clyde Roper, the largest was \"46 feet (14\u00a0m) long\" (Cerullo & Roper, 2012:22). O'Shea & Bolstad (2008) give a maximum total length of for females based on the examination of more than 130 specimens, measured \"post mortem\" and relaxed, as well as beaks recovered from sperm whales (which do not exceed the size of those found in the largest complete specimens). Steve O'Shea estimated the maximum total length for males at (O'Shea, 2003a). Older records of or more were likely exaggerated by stretching of the long feeding tentacles or resulted from inadequate measurement methods such as pacing (O'Shea & Bolstad, 2008; Roper & Shea, 2013:113). Charles G. M. Paxton performed a statistical analysis using literature records of giant squid specimens and concluded that \"squid with a conservative TL of would seem likely based on current data\" (Paxton, 2016a, b), but the study has been heavily criticised by experts in the field (Greshko, 2016). O'Shea has stated that, given the available evidence, the highest upper bound he would consider plausible for the giant squid's total length would be , and that the likelihood that there exist 20-metre giant squid is \"so exceedingly remote that you couldn't justify the effort in writing about it\" (Bittel, 2016). O'Shea contends that Paxton's estimates are skewed because his data set included unreliable (and exaggerated) records from the nineteenth century. Paxton has responded that even when these questionable records are excluded the analysis gives \"a maximum length of just over 20 metres with a 99.9% prediction interval\" (Bittel, 2016).",

They usually measure 8 feet (2.4 m) in length, usually have a shoulder height of about 4-4-1/2 feet (1.2-1.4 m), and a hindfoot length of 11 in (28\u00a0cm). One study found that the average weight for a coastal male was around 408\u00a0kilograms (900\u00a0lb). For a female, this average weight would be 227\u00a0kilograms (500\u00a0lb). On the other hand, an occasional huge male brown has been recorded which greatly exceeds ordinary size, with weights reported up to . A large coastal male of this size may stand up to tall on its hind legs and be up to at the shoulder. The biggest individual on record was shot in 1948 near Cold Bay. Its weight was estimated at to . This bear just came out of hibernation and carried little or no fat; that means the animal would have weighed around at the end of the summer. Although variable from blonde to nearly black, grizzly bear fur is typically brown in color with white tips. A pronounced hump appears on their shoulders; the hump is a good way to distinguish a black bear from a grizzly bear, as black bears do not have this hump.",

Streptanthus longisiliquus (orth. var. \"S. longisiliqus\") is a species of flowering plant in the mustard family known by the common name long-fruit jewelflower. It was first described to science in 2007. It is endemic to northern California, where it is known from Butte, Tehama, and Shasta Counties. It can be found in forest and woodland habitat in mountains and foothills. It is a short-lived perennial herb producing a few-branched stem up to 1.2 to 1.5 meters in maximum height. It is mostly hairless except for some light hairs on the inflorescences and sometimes the leaf petioles. The basal leaves have oval or spoon-shaped blades up to 10 centimeters long, usually with smooth edges. Leaves higher on the stem are oval or oblong and lack petioles, their bases often clasping the stem. Flowers occur at intervals along the upper stem. Each flower has a bell-shaped calyx of sepals which yellow-green at the base and purplish at the tip, measuring under a centimeter in length. The petals emerging from the end are brownish or purplish with greenish bases. The fruit is a flattened, curving silique that can be quite long even for the genus, measuring up to 15 centimeters in length.",

            "document": "Principal Triangulation of Great Britain . The process of measurement was exceedingly precise. Since the ground was undulating and falling about 370\u00a0ft. along the length of the base, the measurement was carried out over 26 stages with varying slopes, the chains for any one stage being constrained to a perfectly straight line by many intermediate supports. These hypotenuse measurements were then projected to the horizontal. Furthermore, the temperature varied from day to day and each measurement was corrected to the length that a chain would take at 62\u00a0\u00b0F. Finally, the length of the base was reduced to its projection at sea level using the height of the south base above the Thames and the fall in the Thames down to its estuary. The final result was approximately 3\u00a0inches less than that of Roy and the mean value of 27404.2\u00a0ft. was taken of the baseline. The difference of the two values meant that the accuracy of the measurement could be claimed to be 1\u00a0inch in 27,404\u00a0ft, which is 3 parts per million.",

The longest crocodilian skull belonging to an extant species was of this species and measured in length, with a mandibular length of . Most of the owners of these enormous skulls surprisingly had no confirmed (or even anecdotal) total measurements, but based on the known skull-to-total length ratio for the species, they would measure approximately in length.",
