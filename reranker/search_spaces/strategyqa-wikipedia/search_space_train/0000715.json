Based on this account, some modern scholars say he is of Turkic origin. Dimitri Gutas, an American Arabist of Greek origin, criticizes this, saying that Ibn Khallik\u0101n's account is aimed at the earlier historical accounts by Ibn Ab\u012b U\u1e63aibi\u02bfa, and serves the purpose to \"prove\" a Turkic origin for al-Farabi, for instance by mentioning the additional nisba (surname) \"\"al-Turk\"\" (arab. \"the Turk\")\u2014a nisba Farabi never had. However, Abu al-Fed\u0101', who copied Ibn \u1e34hallek\u0101n, corrected this and changed \"al-Tork\u012b\" to the phrase \"wa-k\u0101na rajolan tork\u012byan\", meaning \"he was a Turkish man.\" In this regard, Oxford professor C.E.

The collection of classical works and their translation into the Arabian language initiated a period which is known today as the Islamic Golden Age. According to Hourani (1991), the works of the classical scholars of antiquity were met with considerable intellectual curiosity by Islamic scholars. Hourani quotes al-Kindi (c. 801\u2013873 AD), \"the father of Islamic philosophy\", as follows: \"We should not be ashamed to acknowledge truth from whatever source it comes to us, even if it is brought to us by former generations and foreign peoples. For him who seeks the truth there is nothing of higher value than truth itself.\" The works of Aristotle, in particular his \"Nicomachean Ethics\", had a profound influence on the Islamic scholars of the Golden Age like Al-Farabi (870\u2013950 AD), Abu al-Hassan al-Amiri (d. 992 AD) and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (ca. 980\u20131037 AD). In general, the Islamic philosophers saw no contradiction between philosophy and the religion of Islam. However, according to Hourani, al-Farabi also wrote that philosophy in its pure form was reserved for an intellectual elite, and that ordinary people should rely for guidance on the \"sharia\". The distinction between a scholarly elite and the less educated masses \"was to become a commonplace of Islamic thought\". As exemplified by the works of al-Razi (854\u2013925 AD), during later times, philosophy \"was carried on as a private activity, largely by medical men, pursued with discretion, and often met with suspicion\".",

He says that it cannot be known by intellectual means, such as dialectical division or definition, because the terms used in these processes to define a thing constitute its substance. Therefore if one was to define the First Cause, each of the terms used would actually constitute a \"part\" of its substance and therefore behave as a \"cause\" for its existence, which is impossible as the First Cause is uncaused; it exists without being caused. Equally, he says it cannot be known according to genus and differentia, as its substance and existence are different from all others, and therefore it has no category to which it belongs. If this were the case, then it would not be the First Cause, because something would be prior in existence to it, which is also impossible. This would suggest that the more philosophically simple a thing is, the more perfect it is. And based on this observation, Adamson says it is possible to see the entire hierarchy of al-Farabi's cosmology according to classification into genus and species.

Through active intellect we could know that what the reality of things in nature is.According to Avicenna those who could separate their souls from earthly distractions, at the same time could united with the active intellect during a journey. in Islamic philosophy the active intellect has to do with Neoplatonic cosmology. this intelligence is associates with moon and Angel Jibril or Holy Spirit (Islam). peripatetic philosophers in Islamic world try to show a Platonized version of active intellect on the basis of which human soul and sensible world united with intelligence and intelligibility.

The exact precedents of Al Farabi's influential philosophical scheme, in which \"nous\" (Arabic \"\u02bfaql\") plays an important role, are no longer perfectly clear because of the great loss of texts in the Middle Ages which he would have had access to. He was apparently innovative in at least some points. He was clearly influenced by the same late classical world as neoplatonism, neopythagoreanism, but exactly how is less clear. Plotinus, Themistius and Alexander of Aphrodisias are generally accepted to have been influences. However while these three all placed the active intellect \"at or near the top of the hierarchy of being\", Al Farabi was clear in making it the lowest ranking in a series of distinct transcendental intelligences. He is the first known person to have done this in a clear way. He was also the first philosopher known to have assumed the existence of a causal hierarchy of celestial spheres, and the incorporeal intelligences parallel to those spheres. Al Farabi also fitted an explanation of prophecy into this scheme, in two levels. According to Davidson (p.\u00a059):The lower of the two levels, labeled specifically as \"prophecy\" (\"nubuwwa\"), is enjoyed by men who have not yet perfected their intellect, whereas the higher, which Alfarabi sometimes specifically names \"revelation\" (\"w-\u1e25-y\"), comes exclusively to those who stand at the stage of acquired intellect. This happens in the imagination (Arabic \"mutakhayyila\"; Greek \"phantasia\"), a faculty of the mind already described by Aristotle, which al Farabi described as serving the rational part of the soul (Arabic \"\u02bfaql\"; Greek \"nous\"). This faculty of imagination stores sense perceptions (\"ma\u1e25s\u016bs\u0101t\"), disassembles or recombines them, creates figurative or symbolic images (\"mu\u1e25\u0101k\u0101t\") of them which then appear in dreams, visualizes present and predicted events in a way different from conscious deliberation (\"rawiyya\"). This is under the influence, according to Al Farabi, of the active intellect. Theoretical truth can only be received by this faculty in a figurative or symbolic form, because the imagination is a physical capability and can not receive theoretical information in a proper abstract form. This rarely comes in a waking state, but more often in dreams. The lower type of prophecy is the best possible for the imaginative faculty, but the higher type of prophecy requires not only a receptive imagination, but also the condition of an \"acquired intellect\", where the human \"nous\" is in \"conjunction\" with the active intellect in the sense of God. Such a prophet is also a philosopher. When a philosopher-prophet has the necessary leadership qualities, he becomes philosopher-king.",

However, in the Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: al-Kindi (Alkindus), al-Farabi (Abunaser), \u0130bn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Bajjah (Avempace), Ibn Rushd (Averroes), and Ibn Khaldun. The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), sultan, ummah, cemaa (obligation)-and even the \"core\" terms of the Qur'an\u2014i.e., ibadah (worship), din (religion), rab (master) and ilah (deity)\u2014is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other jurists and ulama posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the Khawarij in the very early years of Islamic history on Khilafa and Ummah, or that of Shia Islam on the concept of Imamah are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the Ehl-i Sunna and Shia in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character. Political thought was not purely rooted in theism, however. Aristotleanism flourished as the Islamic Golden Age saw rise to a continuation of the peripaetic philosophers who implemented the ideas of Aristotle in the context of the Islamic world. Abunaser, Avicenna, Ibn Rushd and Ibn Khaldun where part of this philosophical school who claimed that human reason surpassed mere coincidence and revelation. They believed, for example, that natural phenomena occurs because of certain rules (made by god), not because god interfered directly (unlike Al-Ghazali and his followers).",

            "document": "Anomalous monism . How can all this be formalized? At the beginning, we attributed the predicate \"no\" to Thomas as a direct response to our question. This is a physical predicate \"F\". We can call the attribution of Thomas' belief that the relationship cannot continue \"m\". From \"Fx\", we cannot deduce \"mx\". On the basis of the hypothesis that a person who is angry is not capable of examining their own opinions clearly, we asked Thomas if he was angry. We ascribed to him the mental predicate \"m1\" and the physical predicate \"F1\" (the answer \"yes\" to the question whether he is angry). Now, we can deduce \"m1\" (the fact that he is angry) from \"F1\". But from \"m1\" and \"F1\", we can deduce neither \"m\" (the fact that Thomas believes the relationship cannot continue) nor \"not m\". So we continue by attributing the next physical predicate \"F2\" (the positive answer to our question whether he will be of the same opinion in one month).",

The \"Treatise on Logic\" (Arabic: \"Maqala Fi-Sinat Al-Mantiq\") has been printed 17 times, including editions in Latin (1527), German (1805, 1822, 1833, 1828), French (1935), and English (1938), and in an abridged Hebrew form. The work illustrates the essentials of Aristotelian logic to be found in the teachings of the great Arabic philosophers such as Avicenna and, above all, Al-Farabi, \"the Second Master,\" the \"First Master\" being Aristotle. In his work devoted to the Treatise, R\u00e9mi Brague stresses the fact that Al-Farabi is the only philosopher mentioned therein. This indicates a line of conduct for the reader, who must read the text keeping in mind Al-Farabi's works on logic. In the Hebrew versions, the Treatise is called \"The words of Logic\" which describes the bulk of the work. The author explains the technical meaning of the words used by logicians. The Treatise duly inventories the terms used by the logician and indicates what they refer to. The work proceeds rationally through a lexicon of philosophical terms to a summary of higher philosophical topics, in 14 chapters corresponding to Maimonides's birthdate of 14 Nissan. The number 14 recurs in many of Maimonides's works. Each chapter offers a cluster of associated notions. The meaning of the words is explained and illustrated with examples. At the end of each chapter, the author carefully draws up the list of words studied.",

He combines his ideas with Plato's and with Islamic tradition; he considers the ideal state to be one based on the Islamic law (\"shariah\"). His interpretation of Plato's philosopher-king followed that of Al-Farabi, which equates the philosopher-king with the imam, caliph and lawgiver of the state. Averroes' description of the characteristics of a philosopher-king are similar to those given by Al-Farabi; they include love of knowledge, good memory, love of learning, love of truth, dislike for sensual pleasures, dislike for amassing wealth, magnanimity, courage, steadfastness, eloquence and the ability to \"light quickly on the middle term\". Averroes writes that if philosophers cannot rule\u2014as was the case in the Almoravid and Almohad empires around his lifetime\u2014philosophers must still try to influence the rulers towards implementing the ideal state.",

Al-Kindi's view was, however, a common misconception regarding Greek philosophy amongst Muslim intellectuals at the time, and it was for this reason that Avicenna remarked that he did not understand Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\" properly until he had read a prolegomenon written by al-Farabi.",
