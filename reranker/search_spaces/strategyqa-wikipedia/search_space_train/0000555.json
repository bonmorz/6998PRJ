Indeed, the original haiku included the theme \"oni\" (the \"it\" in Japanese is a demon, though in some parts a very young child forced to play \"it\" was called a \"sea slug\" (namako)). To him, seeing a game of hide-and-seek, or recalling it as it grew cold would be a chilling experience. Terayama might also have recalled opening his eyes and finding himself all alone, feeling the cold more intensely than he did a minute before among other children. Either way, any genuinely personal experience would be haiku and not senry\u016b in the classic sense. If you think Terayama's poem uses a child's game to express in hyperbolic metaphor how, in retrospect, life is short, and nothing more, then this would indeed work as a senry\u016b. Otherwise, it is a bona-fide haiku. There is also the possibility that it is a joke about playing hide and seek, only to realize (winter having arrived during the months spent hiding) that no one wants to find you.",

His translations apply a 5\u20137\u20135 syllable count in English, with the first and third lines end-rhymed. Yasuda considered that haiku translated into English should utilize all of the poetic resources of the language. Yasuda's theory also includes the concept of a \"haiku moment\" based in personal experience, and provides the motive for writing a haiku (' an aesthestic moment' of a timeless feeling of enlightened harmony as the poet's nature and the environment are unified').

Next, the biggest bit of luck of all, Zen, through the books of Suzuki Daisetz ... Last but not least there appeared senryu, which might well be dignified by the term Senryu no Michi, the Way of Senryu, for it is an understanding of all things by laughing and smiling at them, and this means forgiving all things, ourselves and God included\". Blyth wrote six books on haiku and four books on humour and senryu, the genre sister of haiku: 'In haiku things speak for themselves with the voice of a man, in senryu things do not speak; we speak and speak for ourselves', in senryu the world is 'not seen as God made it' but 'as man sees it'; 'to haiku, sex hardly exists; to senryu, it is all pervading ... a great many deal with the subject of the Yoshiwara...'",

Present-day attitudes to Blyth's work vary: On the one hand, he is appreciated as a populariser of Japanese culture; on the other, his portrayals of haiku and Zen have sometimes been criticised as one-dimensional. Many contemporary Western writers of haiku were introduced to the genre through his Zen-based haiku explanations. These include the San Francisco and Beat Generation writers, Gary Snyder, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg as well as J. D. Salinger and E. E. Cummings. Many members of the international \"haiku community\" also got their first views of haiku from Blyth's books, including American author James W. Hackett (born 1929), Eric Amann, William J. Higginson, Anita Virgil, Jane Reichhold, and Lee Gurga. Some noted Blyth's distaste for haiku on more modern themes and his strong bias regarding a direct connection between haiku and Zen, a connection largely ignored by modern Japanese poets. (Bash\u014d, in fact, felt that his devotion to haiku prevented him from realising enlightenment. In addition, many classic Japanese haiku poets, including Chiyo-ni, Buson, and Issa were Pure Land (Jodo) rather than Zen Buddhists.) Blyth also did not view haiku by Japanese women favourably, downplaying their substantial contributions to the genre, especially during the Bash\u014d era and the twentieth century. In just over 800 pages of text in his two volume \"History of Haiku\", Blyth devotes a total of 16 pages to haiku by women, and even these pages are run through with negative comments about women as writers of haiku. \"Women are said to be intuitive, and as they cannot think, we may hope this is so, but intuition, like patriotism, is not enough.\" With respect to a verse ostensibly by Chi-yo he wrote, \"Chiyo's authorship of this verse is doubtful, but so is whether women can write haiku.\"",

The death of his youngest brother Larry in the Vietnam War inspired some poignant and powerful haiku, and made his reputation as a haiku elegist. He is quoted by haiku author and book editor Cor van den Heuvel as saying he wrote haiku \"to get in touch with the real\". Virgilio experimented with the haiku form, trying several innovations that other American haiku poets were exploring, including dropping the traditional 5-7-5 syllable count in favor of shorter forms. He sometimes included rhyme in his haiku along with the gritty reality of urban America. A collection of his selected haiku was published in 1985.
