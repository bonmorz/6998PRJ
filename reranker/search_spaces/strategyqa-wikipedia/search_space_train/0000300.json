He focused his jiu-jitsu training without the traditional gi; becoming one of the first jiu-jitsu schools to do so. The idea behind this was to try to implement as many of the techniques as possible in mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions. Bravo worked for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) during this time and felt high-level jiu-jitsu practitioners weren't winning as much they should have, mainly attributing this to them wearing a gi when training jiu-jitsu but competing in MMA without one. 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu has been controversial since it's inception.
