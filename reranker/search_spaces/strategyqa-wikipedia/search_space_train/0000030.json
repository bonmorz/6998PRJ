He was selected as an All-American in 1894 and 1895 while playing for the University of Pennsylvania. Penn was undefeated and won the national championship of football in the two seasons that Brooke was named an All-American. All-American selector, Caspar Whitney called Brooke a \"very hard man to stop. He strikes the line with almost irresistible force.\" He was regarded as a ferocious fullback and a top notch punter. He is credited with coining the phrase \"coffin corner\" when describing his long punts deep into the opposing end of the field. Brooke was barred from playing for Pennsylvania after the 1895 season because of an agreement between Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania that limited players to four seasons. After finishing a bachelor's degree from Pennsylvania, Brooke was the subject of an allegation of being an ineligible player in an October 24, 1896 game in New Orleans, LA. In the game, Brooke played only one down for Tulane University before LSU protested to the game's referee. Tulane claimed that Brooke planned on enrolling there as a graduate student. During the debate between team captains, Brooke refused to sign an affidavit stating his intention to enroll at Tulane, as he was already enrolled in law school at the University of Pennsylvania. The referee ruled him ineligible to play. The Tulane football team refused to continue playing the game without Brooke, so the referee ruled the game to be a forfeit in favor of LSU.",

Hansen has commented on the relationship between the liberal arts and the U.S. business sector in letters to the editor, opinion editorials and articles. She has dismissed arguments brought forward by academics issuing that liberal arts colleges tend to disparage and undermine students who wish to participate in fields such as finance, business, and accounting. Author and 27th president of Dickinson College, William G. Durden charged liberal arts leaders with creating an elitist, \u201cseparatist\u201d perspective. Hansen rejected this charge citing the \"intellectual and ethical virtues fostered by their undergraduate experience\" as a key to their success. She was quoted as saying:Rather than faulting liberal education for failing to prevent greed and corruption in corporate America, we need to do a better job of communicating what the CEOs who prefer to hire liberal arts graduates already know: Although our expertise rests in academic disciplines and our worth to society has much to do with the intrinsic human need to learn, we have many \u201cpractical\u201d programs, and access to the broad learning achieved through a liberal education gives our graduates a realistic understanding of the complexity of the world and prepares them for lives satisfying to themselves and useful to others.Hansen has at times criticized collegiate admission practices stating that although restructuring the admissions platforms most universities use are generally agreed upon, how one is to do this is highly debatable. The shift from de-emphasizing individual performance and achievement, to general \u201cauthentically chosen\u201d activities generating \u201cemotional and ethical awareness and skills,\" is, according to Hansen, \"doing more harm than good.\" She refuted a report issued by the Harvard School of Education which asserted that colleges and universities will have a better pool of students should they choose to admit students based on group activities, putting less value on individual contribution. Hansen asserts that implementing admission standards that focus on these metrics \"invites only skepticism and confusion.\" She notes that admission officers can't reasonably deduce whether a student has an appropriate level of gratitude from a supplementary essay. To implement these subjective metrics would mean dramatic changes to the culture and pedagogy of universities. Hansen states that low-income students can't easily find the specific jobs and work experience required of them to fill subjective and speculative metrics. She goes on to state that \"we know too little about how and when to identify, characterize, measure and develop the so-called noncognitive aspects of learning that this report asks colleges to evaluate. And I disagree that the gateway to college is the time or place to subject young people to the full impact of our ignorance about how to fairly assess things they should still be questioning and exploring -- like character, feelings, motives and values.\"",

            "document": "College admissions in the United States . There are numerous reports that colleges use proprietary mathematical algorithms as part of their process for evaluating applications. Some colleges hire statistical experts known as \"enrollment consultants\" to help them predict enrollment by developing computer models to select applicants in such a way as to maximize yield and acceptance rates. Some of these models take into account factors such as an applicant's \"zip code, religion, first-choice major and extracurricular interests, as well as academic performance\". Colleges have been reported to have mathematical algorithms that recalculate an applicant's high school grade point average by weighing different course grades by factors such as perceived course difficulty and strength of high school curriculum. This helps the college come up with a revised GPA number for a student to compare against applicants from other schools. Furthermore, many colleges track how well other students from the same high school have done\u2014that is, applicants from the same high school who attended or are attending the college\u2014by comparing their high school grades against their college grades, and admissions officers use this data to try to estimate the likely college grade performance of a given applicant. Generally admissions departments do not reveal the particulars of such mathematical analyses. According to Michele Hernandez, Ivy League admissions departments compile an \"academic index\" based on three main factors: In her view, two-thirds of this evaluation is based on tests, while only one third is based on grades, leading her to conclude at one point that grades were less important overall as a factor than test scores, while in a different chapter she also suggested that the high school transcript information described roughly 60% of the college's perception of a student's academic performance. Next, the composite \"academic index\" score was combined with an analysis of personal factors such as extracurricular activity or the essay, such that the academic factor was weighted 70% to 85% while the personal evaluation was weighted only 30% to 15%. Generally the particulars of the mathematical formulas are not revealed to the public, and different colleges have different formulas. Part of the purpose of algorithms is to expedite the handling of thousands of applications in a short amount of time. For example, at Dartmouth College, data goes into a \"master card\" for each application, which leads to a \"ready sheet\", where readers summarize applications; then, an initial screening is done: top applications go directly to the director of admissions for approval while lackluster ones go to another director. Dartmouth uses \"A\" for accept, \"R\" for reject, \"P\" for possible, with \"P+\" and \"P-\" being variants. A committee might spend a week with the \"P\" ones, of which they only accept about a sixth, according to Hernandez.",

            "document": "College admissions in the United States . There are conflicting views about student participation in extracurricular activities. A predominant position is that colleges were after \"well-rounded bodies of individual specialists\", suggesting that it is better for a student to be deeply involved in one or two activities rather than nine or ten superficially, such as a \"violin-playing quarterback\" or a \"math-medalist poet,\" and that students should not \"overdo it\" and that parents should not become overconcerned about their child's extracurricular activities. Applicants who achieve a leadership position in an extracurricular activity are regarded more highly than applicants who merely participate in a bunch of activities. Advisors recommend that a student should choose which extracurricular activities they genuinely care about, pursue them with \"gusto\" and \"joyful commitment\" that demonstrates integrity and commitment. And, consistent with this view, is that too many extracurricular activities may look suspect to admissions officers, particularly if it seems unreasonable that any person could be as active and succeed scholastically at the same time. Jobs are generally viewed favorably by admissions committees, including even part-time service jobs such as flipping hamburgers, since it suggests that a student has learned to handle time management, to accept responsibility, and develop people skills. A less dominant position was that it is helpful to be involved in a \"variety of activities\", including jobs, internships, and community service. Some universities, such as the University of California, have formal programs for spot-checking applications for accuracy, such as sending a follow-up letter to the student asking for proof about an extracurricular activity or summer job. Advisors recommend that extracurricular activities should never interfere with a student's overall academic performance. A student with many extracurricular activities in twelfth grade, but few in preceding years, particularly when the essays focus on the extracurricular activities, is suspect; this suggests an applicant is being coached, and may reflect negatively on an application (see the section on consultants). Advisors warn against \"overscheduling\" students with too many activities or courses.",

Half of admissions officers at both public universities and a third of officers at four-year colleges were actively seeking students who could \"pay full price\" and did not need financial aid, according to one survey of 462 admissions directors and managers in 2011. The report suggested that full-pay students tended to have lower high school grades and test scores than other students, compared to other applicants, on average. Two other reports confirmed that public university admissions officers were actively seeking out-of-state and international students since they paid higher rates for tuition. Another report found that one in ten admissions officers had said that their college admitted full-pay students despite their having lower average grades and test scores. Reports vary about whether the financial neediness of applicants impacts admissions chances; one suggested that applicants with strong academic credentials or talents are more likely to get financial aid, but that depending on the college, \"borderline admits\" needing money were most vulnerable; a second report was that \"colleges like rich students\".

Maintaining high grades is particularly important for the fall semester of twelfth grade, as well as winter grades if applying by regular admission, and there is a report that colleges are paying greater attention to a student's grades throughout twelfth grade. Particularly important is academic performance in core courses, and having a high grade point average based on good grades in AP-level or honors courses. Colleges evaluate applicants often by examining how a student has successfully exploited what a high school has had to offer. High school guidance counselor Erin Day of Summit High School in New Jersey suggested that of the top five criteria for getting into college, having good grades were first, second, and third most important overall (test scores were fourth, extracurricular activities and essay were fifth). An ideal academic record is one of increasingly better grades in courses of progressive difficulty. Hernandez wrote that colleges looked for patterns with both grades and test scores; high grades with low test scores suggested a hard-working student, but high test scores with low grades suggested a picture of a lazy student. Ninth grade grades generally do not count much, but trends are important\u2014an upward trend in grades was a positive factor, a decline a negative one.

The medical schools sold medical degrees to whoever paid the tuition fee. No preliminary education was required for admission. When Harvard University and University of Pennsylvania raised the academic standards earlier, they faced a revenue drop as fewer students were qualified for admission. The precarious financial situation of Hopkins worried Gilman; he could not afford a new financial dilemma. He tried to convince Garrett to lower her standards, but failed. Through negotiations, Garret finally agreed to modify two paragraphs of her terms, emphasizing that her terms of gift \"would not interfere with the operation of the university.\" She also added that the university could modify the admission requirement, but the standard should remain the same. On February 20, 1893, she approved the statement and terms and signed the Requirements of Admission.

SBMPTN is a university admission where you take two or three tests (aptitude test, natural science test, and/or social science test), applicants will also be required to submit into a practical session if the chosen major is art, music, or physical education. You also choose 3 different majors and/or universities. This examination is held nationwide once a year and unlike SNMPTN, is open to high school graduates of the last 3 years. Many students repeat or take gap years to retake the SBMPTN to get into their wanted university. According to the Ministry of Higher Education, minimum 30% of the entire public university quota should admit from SBMPTN. However, most public universities allocate 60% and above for SBMPTN due to the constantly high success rate of students who were accepted from this scheme. SBMPTN is known for its very difficult questions and challenging time-management difficulties. The exam is also held CBT (Computer-Based) starting of last year. Most universities are conducting independent selection mechanism on their own beside SNMPTN and SBMPTN such as SIMAK or PPKB from Universitas Indonesia or UTUL from Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM). These are called special programs as they tend to be more expensive due to the incentive that these programs are not under government subsidies. Meanwhile, Private Universities usually do their admission before and after Public Universities Admission. They sometimes do several admissions. Governmental Agency Institutions does their admission independently (not included in Unified National Public Universities Admission) and will usually have their own scheme for selection.",

The Central Applications Office processes applications from Irish, British and European Union applicants for undergraduate courses on behalf of Trinity College. Decisions on admissions to undergraduate courses are made by Trinity College who instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates. In order to be considered for admission, all applicants must first reach the university's minimal matriculation requirements, which typically involves holding sufficient recognised qualifications in English, Mathematics and a second language. Furthermore, applicants for certain courses may be required to achieve more specific qualifications than those prescribed for minimum matriculation requirements. Eligible applicants must then compete for places based on the results of their school leaving examinations, however, applicants can additionally take matriculation examinations which are held in the university in April, in which each subject is considered equivalent to that of the Irish Leaving Certificate. Applications for restricted courses require further assessment considered in the admissions process, such as the Health Professions Admissions Test (HPAT) for medicine or entrance tests for music and drama courses. As applications for most courses far exceeds available places, admission is highly selective, demanding excellent grades in the aforementioned examinations. Through the CAO, candidates may list several courses at Trinity College and at other third-level institutions in Ireland in order of preference. Places are awarded in mid-August every year by the CAO after matching the number of places available to the academic attainments of the applicants. Qualifications are measured as \"points\", with specific scales for the Irish Leaving Certificate, UK GCE A-level, the International Baccalaureate and all other European Union school leaving examinations.",
