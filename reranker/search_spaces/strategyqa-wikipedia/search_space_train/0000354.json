After Matilda was widowed in 1125, she returned to her father in England, who then secured her marriage to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but after Henry I's death in 1135 Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned, before Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was less patient: she secured the support of the king of Scotland, David I, her maternal uncle, and the support of her half-brother Robert, Earl of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of Henry\u00a0I, in 1138.",

In a special entitled \"Last Man Standing\", a Mob consisting largely of former top Mob members and game show champions, including Brad Rutter, Ken Jennings, Nancy Christy, Kevin Olmstead, and Annie Duke among others, competed only against each other; the winner earned a guaranteed $250,000. The rules were a modified in that there were no helps, no money for each question, and one person, in this case, Annie Duke, was randomly selected to act as the \"1\". Thus, this game was actually 1 vs. 99. Given the nature of this episode, Duke was not allowed to walk away from the game. Duke and Jennings were among two of the final five aiming for the prize. The question was \"Who has been married the most times? \u2013 King Henry VIII, Larry King, or 'King of Pop', Michael Jackson.\" Duke, Jennings, and two of the other remaining contestants incorrectly guessed King Henry VIII. Ultimately, the winner was entertainment lawyer and former actor Larry Zerner, as he was the only one who answered Larry King.",

It was written by Mike Bullen, directed by Ciaran Donnelly, and was first broadcast on the ITV network on 10 December 2001. The plot follows on directly from the previous episode, as Adam and Rachel (James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale), and Karen and David (Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst) travel to Sydney, Australia for Pete and Jo's (John Thomson and Kimberley Joseph) impromptu wedding. Adam is sceptical that Pete is truly in love with Jo, and Jo's rich father Rod (Gary Sweet) suspects that Pete is only marrying her to get access to his money. Under pressure from Rod, Pete gets cold feet and he and Jo call off the wedding. The couple soon reconcile and marry with Rod's blessing. Meanwhile, David discovers that Karen has been having an affair with her colleague Mark (Sean Pertwee) and ends their marriage, and Rachel gives birth prematurely in a Sydney hospital.",

While prostitution is illegal in Iran, the Shiah institution of Nikah mut\u2018ah (temporary marriage, usually called \"Sigheh\" in Iran) allows contractual short-term relations between both sexes. Usually, a dowry is given to the temporary wife. Sigheh can last from 3days to 99 years (although some Islamic scholars (mujtahids), say that it is impossible to marry a person, as temporary marriage, for a period of time that is usually longer than the average life-time of a person); it expires automatically without divorce. According to a number of scholars and Iranians, Sigheh is being misused as a legal cover for prostitution in Iran. Religious people argue that Islamic temporary marriage is different from prostitution for a couple of reasons, including the necessity of iddah in case the couple have sexual intercourse. It means that if a woman marries a man in this way and has sex, she has to wait for a certain period of time before marrying again and therefore, a woman cannot marry more than a limited number of times in a year. It has been reported that the number of temporary marriages entered into is on the increase.",

When he is about to leave and head back home, he asks his friend Bob to stem the tide of admiring ladies rushing his hotel door by pretending to be him. Larry takes off, and Bob does his best to pretend he is Larry. But Colette, an actress who inadvertently causes Bob to miss the boat train, finds that she gets more than she bargained for by befriending \"Larry\". While looking for a room for the night, the inebriated Mayor accidentally marries them as Mr. and Mrs. Charters. Undeterred, the couple meet up with the real Larry in London the next day.  Larry has more girl-trouble with two women admirers nearly meeting in the hallway, one of whom is Lulu, who is nearly psychotically jealous of any other woman. Bertie Bird, who seems to do nothing more than sleep, is one of Larry's friends, and who asks for a key to his guest room so he can get a good night's sleep, after his napping all day. When Bob and Colette arrive, it's apparent that Larry and she fall in love instantly, but are too embarrassed to admit it, especially as she is married to Bob, although under Larry's name. Things get even more complex when Colette goes to bed in the guest bedroom, and is joined under the covers by Bertie. Suddenly Colette is branded as the Female Bluebeard, since she is \"married\" three times, albeit by three very tenuous means.",
