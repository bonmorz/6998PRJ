Sanja has managed to bring to life moments of Tesla's life that the public had yet to see and displayed important moments and sequences of Tesla's life, which for mysterious reasons have remained a well kept secret to date. Tesla whom we might have referred to as holy, sacred, died before he was recognized as someone who truly marked the history of mankind. Sanja's play was supported by the Office for Cooperation with Diaspora and Serbs in the Region, Consulate General of the Republic of Serbia in New York, Vuk Jeremi\u0107 - Serbian physicist, politician and President of the 67th session of United Nations General Assembly, the Tesla Science Foundation, the Nikola Tesla Club, and the Nikola Tesla Inventors Club in the US.",

Anthony Russo expanded, \"in a lot of ways [superhero registration] can be a political issue, and we didn't want the conflict of the movie to solely exist on that level. We wanted to figure out very personal reasons why everyone's relationship to this idea of registration is going to become complicated. That's what the relationship between Steve and Bucky allowed us to do, to get very personal in terms of why people would lean one way or the other.\" Executive producer Nate Moore added that \"it felt like it was kind of the right time\" to adapt \"Civil War\" given \"The Avengers\", plus many of the Phase Two films (\"\", \"The Winter Soldier\", and \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\"), all dealt with \"world-ending experiences.
