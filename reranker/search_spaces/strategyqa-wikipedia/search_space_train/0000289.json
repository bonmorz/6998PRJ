As thirteen years had passed since the last 2D \"Metroid\" game\u20142004's \"\"\u2014was released, Sakamoto had a desire to create a new game in this style. He was also aware of the growing demand from fans for a new 2D \"Metroid\" game. Sakamoto had heard that MercurySteam were interested in taking on the challenge of remaking a \"Metroid\" game, so he visited their studio to organise a collaboration. Although Sakamoto did not work on \"Metroid II\", he believed it to be an important game within the series and so he was enthusiastic about remaking the title. Enric \u00c1lvarez, the head of MercurySteam, described their collaboration with Nintendo as an \"incredible\" achievement for the developer. The development on \"Samus Returns\" began in 2015. Sakamoto noted that the potential for 2D games in the \"Metroid\" franchise had opened up for Nintendo following the announcement of the game. He expressed that he was keen to evolve some of the traditions in 2D \"Metroid\" games. As a remake, he wanted to preserve some of the originality and wanted to avoid changing things without good reason. Their approach was to add to aspects which improved upon the game's core concept. These ideas led to some control enhancements, such as the addition of free aiming for more precise firing. The idea of a melee counterattack came from MercurySteam, who had implemented a similar parry mechanic in their 2013 game, \"\". Sakamoto felt that the inclusion of the melee counterattack offered players an alternative combat style, in contrast to previous games where the player had to rely on dodging charge attacks from enemies and then defeating them from afar. The decision to transition from the 2D pixel art of previous \"Metroid\" titles to 3D polygonal graphics was made so that the development team could incorporate a lot of varied animation and use different angles to enhance the cutscenes. The music was composed by Daisuke Matsuoka and directed by Kenji Yamamoto, with the latter previously co-composing the music for the 1994 Super Nintendo Entertainment System game \"Super Metroid\".",

Yoshio Sakamoto, executive officer of Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development division, served as the game's producer, while Takehiko Hosokawa of the same studio was the co-director, along with Jose Luis M\u00e1rquez of MercurySteam. As thirteen years had passed since the last 2D \"Metroid\" game\u20142004's \"\"\u2014was released, Sakamoto had a desire to create a new game in this style. He was also aware of the growing demand from fans for a new 2D \"Metroid\" game. Sakamoto had heard that MercurySteam were interested in taking on the challenge of remaking a \"Metroid\" game, so he visited their studio to organise a collaboration. Although Sakamoto did not work on \"Metroid II\", he believed it to be an important game within the series and so he was enthusiastic about remaking the title. Enric \u00c1lvarez, the head of MercurySteam, described their collaboration with Nintendo as an \"incredible\" achievement for the developer. The development on \"Samus Returns\" began in 2015. Sakamoto noted that the potential for 2D games in the \"Metroid\" franchise had opened up for Nintendo following the announcement of the game. He expressed that he was keen to evolve some of the traditions in 2D \"Metroid\" games. As a remake, he wanted to preserve some of the originality and wanted to avoid changing things without good reason. Their approach was to add to aspects which improved upon the game's core concept. These ideas led to some control enhancements, such as the addition of free aiming for more precise firing. The idea of a melee counterattack came from MercurySteam, who had implemented a similar parry mechanic in their 2013 game, \"\". Sakamoto felt that the inclusion of the melee counterattack offered players an alternative combat style, in contrast to previous games where the player had to rely on dodging charge attacks from enemies and then defeating them from afar. The decision to transition from the 2D pixel art of previous \"Metroid\" titles to 3D polygonal graphics was made so that the development team could incorporate a lot of varied animation and use different angles to enhance the cutscenes.
