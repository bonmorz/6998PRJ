Ineligible for military service because of his poor eyesight, he remained in the US throughout the war, detached from the conflict in Europe and absorbed in his theatrical and literary concerns. In September 1914 he married Ethel May Wayman, \"n\u00e9e\" Newton (1885\u20131984), an English widow. The marriage proved happy and lifelong. Ethel's personality was in contrast with her husband's: he was shy and impractical; she was gregarious, decisive and well organised. In Sproat's phrase, she \"took charge of Wodehouse's life and made certain that he had the peace and quiet he needed to write\". There were no children of the marriage, but Wodehouse came to love Ethel's daughter Leonora (1905\u20131944) and legally adopted her. Wodehouse experimented with different genres of fiction in these years; his \"Psmith, Journalist\", mixing comedy with social comment on slum landlords and racketeers, was published in 1915. In the same year \"The Saturday Evening Post\" paid $3,500 to serialise \"Something New\", the first of what became a series of novels set at Blandings Castle. It was published in hardback in the US and the UK in the same year (the British edition being retitled \"Something Fresh\"). It was Wodehouse's first farcical novel; it was also his first best-seller, and although his later books included some gentler, lightly sentimental stories, it was as a farceur that he became known. Later in the same year \"Extricating Young Gussie\", the first story about Bertie and Jeeves, was published. These stories introduced two sets of characters about whom Wodehouse wrote for the rest of his life. The Blandings Castle stories, set in an English stately home, depict the attempts of the placid Lord Emsworth to evade the many distractions around him, which include successive pairs of young lovers, the machinations of his exuberant brother Galahad, the demands of his domineering sisters and super-efficient secretaries, and anything detrimental to his prize sow, the Empress of Blandings. The Bertie and Jeeves stories feature an amiable young man-about-town, regularly rescued from the consequences of his idiocy by the benign interference of his valet.",

The proposed nominations of Wodehouse for a knighthood in 1967 and 1971 were blocked for fear that such an award would \"revive the controversy of his wartime behaviour and give currency to a Bertie Wooster image of the British character which the embassy was doing its best to eradicate\". When Wodehouse was awarded the knighthood, only four years later, the journalist Dennis Barker wrote in \"The Guardian\" that the writer was \"the solitary surviving English literary comic genius\". After his death six weeks later, the journalist Michael Davie, writing in the same paper, observed that \"Many people regarded\u00a0... [Wodehouse] as he regarded Beachcomber, as 'one, if not more than one, of England's greatest men'\", while in the view of the obituarist for \"The Times\" Wodehouse \"was a comic genius recognized in his lifetime as a classic and an old master of farce\".",
