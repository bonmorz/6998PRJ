And of course we wanted to see the cool weapons in all of their glory.\" The major problem that the writers faced was attempting to build-out Samus's back-story, Nintendo had \"creative\" and \"licensing\" walls that the writers ran into. Foxhoven stated that these questions came up: \"What are they doing when they are NOT fighting? What is their daily existence and relationships? What are Samus's aspirations, history, and fears?\" and further stated that \"Nintendo appreciated the questions, but had never thought about them before, and ultimately didn't have a lot of answers\" and at the end, Nintendo \"felt uncomfortable with our team [Hollywood] being the ones to propose those answers\" which basically caused the \"Metroid\" movie project to be ultimately canceled sometime in 2007. Foxhoven however foresees \"Metroid\" becoming a movie, stating at the end of the IGN interview that \"for Nintendo, they walked away appreciating the process and how much further they needed to explore the franchise so that it has a chance for a feature film at some point\" and he revealed that \"there are quite a few Hollywood executives in town who grew up playing \"Metroid\", and who would be willing to take the time needed to bring Nintendo along in the process.\"",

In preparation for the movie, the script writers, Al Reinart and Bill Broyles, came down to Clear Lake to interview me on \"What are the people in Mission Control really like?\" One of their questions was \"Weren't there times when everybody, or at least a few people, just panicked?\" My answer was \"No, when bad things happened, we just calmly laid out all the options, and failure was not one of them. We never panicked, and we never gave up on finding a solution.\" I immediately sensed that Bill Broyles wanted to leave and assumed that he was bored with the interview. Only months later did I learn that when they got in their car to leave, he started screaming, \"That's it! That's the tag line for the whole movie, Failure is not an option. Now we just have to figure out who to have say it.\" Of course, they gave it to the Kranz character, and the rest is history.",

But this movie is all about support from the internet, and support from fans. This is not a movie where you'll see billboards or bus stop ads or trailers on TV.\" It was additionally expected that Hilton would return in her role as Amber Sweet. However, in a video posted on YouTube, it was revealed that they \"no longer control the answer to the question [of a future sequel]\" since they no longer have ownership of the franchise, thus driving Bousman and Zdunich to make \"The Devil's Carnival\".",

The rules themselves are merely inert marks on paper until a \"human being\" reads, understands and uses them. But what about the 'rules' that are, allegedly, inside our head (brain)? Who reads, understands and uses them? Again, the implicit answer is (and, some would argue, must be) a 'homunculus': a little man who reads the rules of the world and then gives orders to the body to act on them. But again we are in a situation of infinite regress, because this implies that the homunculus utilizes cognitive processes that are also rule bound, which presupposes another homunculus inside \"its\" head, and so on and so forth. Therefore, so the argument goes, theories of mind that imply or state explicitly that cognition is rule bound cannot be correct unless some way is found to 'ground' the regress.",
