Maura Johnston of \"The Guardian\" wrote a negative review of the song, faulting the \"sloppy\" lyrics and blaming Swift for not giving a clear context in the lyrics. Lindsay Zolad of The Ringer said \"Unleashed on a deeply confused public late Thursday night, the song is a strange collage of retro reference points: mid-aughts Gossip Girl placement pop, the soundtrack to Disney's live-action Maleficent, and \u2014 yes, really \u2014 Right Said Fred's I'm Too Sexy, except devoid of the self-effacing humor and wit. Yes, the new Taylor Swift song just made me compliment Right Said Fred.\" Brittany Spanos of \"Rolling Stone\" believed that the song marked a continuation of the feud between Swift and rapper Kanye West; the latter had previously name-dropped Swift in his song \"Famous\" by using the line, \"I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? / I made that bitch famous\". The single was noted as being a darker, angrier work than what Swift had done before. Hugh McIntye of \"Forbes\" was critical of the change in style, saying that it \"didn't sound like [Swift]\" and that it \"may have some kinks to work out\". Meaghan Garvey from \"Pitchfork\" referred to it in a review as \"a hardcore self-own\" track.",

            "document": "Pelagius of Asturias . At some point Pelagius is said to have rebelled, but for what reasons is unknown; such rebellions by local authorities against their superiors formed a common theme in Visigothic Spain. A Muslim army was sent against him under the command of Alkama and the Christian bishop of Seville, Oppa. That Alkama was the general and that there was a bishop of Seville named Oppa among his ranks is generally accepted. A battle was fought near Covadonga (\"in monte Auseva\" or \"in monte Libana\") in which Alkama was killed and Oppa captured. Moorish chronicles of the event describe Pelagius and his small force as \"thirty wild donkeys\", as reported by al-Maqqari in the 17th century. The battle is usually dated to 718 or 719, between the governorships of al-Hurr and as-Sham, though some have dated it as late as 722 and the \"Chronica Albeldensia\" dates it in the 740s.",

            "document": "Our Song (Taylor Swift song) . Swift self-penned \"Our Song\" for the talent show of her freshman year in high school with no intentions of including it on her debut album. She thought to herself that to be appropriate for the talent show, the song she would write needed to be upbeat and relatable to her classmates. \"I wrote it about this guy I was dating, and how we didn't have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one\", she said. The writing process, as with her lead single \"Tim McGraw\", took place in approximately 20 minutes. Several months after performing it at the talent show, some of her peers approached her to inform her that they enjoyed the song she played at the talent show, singing a few lines. \"They'd only heard it once, so I thought, 'There must be something here!'\", Swift recalled. When choosing tracks to record for \"Taylor Swift\", Swift \"stood by\" \"Our Song\", repeatedly insisting album producers to record it with her. She claimed she \"knew there was something about it.\" She concluded, \"I think there's just some sort of magic in the way the track sounds like it's bouncing.\" Swift said she desired for the song to be placed as the closing track on \"Taylor Swift\" due to its last lyrics repeating the phrase \"Play it again\", which she thought would subliminally request audiences to replay the album. Big Machine Records executives chose \"Our Song\" to be the third single from \"Taylor Swift\", which Swift was surprised yet glad about.",
