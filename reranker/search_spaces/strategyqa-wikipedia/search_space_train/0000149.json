On September 23, 2009, during his opening monologue, O'Brien told a very brief joke about Newark, and a supposed health care program for the city's citizens that would involve Newark giving them a bus ticket out of the city. Newark mayor Cory Booker responded in a satirical YouTube video calling for O'Brien to apologize, and that Conan would be banned from ever entering Newark Liberty International Airport until doing so. Conan responded by further making fun of Newark, however, saying the only way he could get to Newark now would be like everyone else, \"through a series of poor decisions.\" He also called out Cory Booker to come on the show to air out their grievances, deciding to then ban Booker from Burbank airport, adding later that he had absolutely no power to do so. Booker subsequently banned Conan from the state of New Jersey as well as all the sister cities of Newark. In response, O'Brien read a letter on air from Elizabeth, New Jersey mayor Chris Bollwage, declaring that he will temporarily rename Terminal A of Newark Liberty (which lies in Elizabeth) the Conan O'Brien Terminal. Conan continued, saying he had created a \"geographic toilet seat\" around Newark. The mayors of Bayonne, East Orange, Kearny, Jersey City, and Elizabeth have publicly sided with Conan O'Brien. He ended this by saying, \"Your move, Mayor Booker.\" The feud was unofficially ended when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for it to end during a prepared comedy bit, telling Booker to \"chalk it up\" to Conan. The following week Conan announced that Cory Booker would be a guest on the October 16, 2009 show to mend the feud. That night, O'Brien and his wife donated $50,000 to the Newark Now Organization, and NBC Universal matched Conan's donation to total a $100,000 gift. Booker also admitted that he is a big Conan fan and often tapes shows to watch the next day or watches them on the website Hulu.",

O'Brien's successful hosting job at the 2002 54th Primetime Emmy Awards \"sent out the most resounding message yet about his growing strength as a performer\", and a year later, NBC broadcast O'Brien's tenth anniversary special in primetime. By the time Leno's contract again came up for renewal, a discussion would be needed regarding the future of \"The Tonight Show\".

On Thursday, January 7, 2010, NBC executive Jeff Zucker met with Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien to discuss how to get Leno out of prime time, where his ratings were lackluster, and back into late night, where O'Brien's ratings had collapsed before Leno's prime time series began. A proposal was made that would see O'Brien remain as host of \"The Tonight Show\", which would be moved to 12:05\u00a0am with Leno hosting a 30-minute show at 11:35\u00a0pm On January 10, NBC Universal Television Entertainment chairman Jeff Gaspin confirmed that \"The Jay Leno Show\" would indeed end at the start of the Winter Olympics on February 12, 2010, and be moved to 11:35\u00a0pm following the Olympics coverage. Sources familiar with the situation told the \"New York Post\" that O'Brien was unhappy with NBC's plan. On January 12, O'Brien released this statement: \"I sincerely believe that delaying \"The Tonight Show\" into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. \"The Tonight Show\" at 12:05 simply isn\u2019t \"The Tonight Show.\"\" On January 21, 2010, it was announced that Conan had reached a deal with NBC that would see him exit \"The Tonight Show\" the next day. The deal also granted him $45\u00a0million, of which $12\u00a0million was designated for distribution to his staff, who had moved with Conan to Los Angeles from New York when he left \"Late Night\".",

Booker subsequently banned Conan from the state of New Jersey as well as all the sister cities of Newark. In response, O'Brien read a letter on air from Elizabeth, New Jersey mayor Chris Bollwage, declaring that he will temporarily rename Terminal A of Newark Liberty (which lies in Elizabeth) the Conan O'Brien Terminal. Conan continued, saying he had created a \"geographic toilet seat\" around Newark. The mayors of Bayonne, East Orange, Kearny, Jersey City, and Elizabeth have publicly sided with Conan O'Brien.

Furthermore, repeated questioning of children causes them to change their answers. This is because the children perceive the repeated questioning as a sign that they did not give the \"correct\" answer previously. Children are also especially susceptible to leading and suggestive questions. Some studies have shown that only a small percentage of children produce fictitious reports of sexual abuse on their own.

In 1993 Max Weinberg became music director for \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" and when putting together a band, he recruited Richie \"La Bamba\" Rosenberg, Mark Pender and Jerry Vivino. The three played until 2009 as members of The Max Weinberg 7, which moved that year with Conan O'Brien to become the latest iteration of The Tonight Show Band. When not on TV, this trio has worked regularly as session musicians. In 2010, the trio toured North America as part of the Legally Prohibited Band (essentially The Tonight Show Band under a different name, with Weinberg's place taken by James Wormwood) in support of Conan O'Brien's 32-city \"Legally Prohibited From Being Funny On Television\" tour. They continue to be part of O'Brien's late night band as part of the Basic Cable Band on O'Brien's current show, \"Conan\".",

Following the 2010 \"Tonight Show\" conflict, O'Brien announced on the first day of The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour that he had signed a deal with cable network TBS to host a talk show on their late-night lineup, beginning in November 2010. Before the deal was announced, O'Brien initially had reservations about the move, as it would place comedian George Lopez's show, \"Lopez Tonight\", one hour later to midnight, effectively doing to Lopez what NBC had wanted to do with O'Brien. However, Lopez reportedly called O'Brien and expressed his excitement about the move. Lopez went on to state, \"I can't think of anything better than doing my show with Conan as my lead-in It's the beginning of a new era in late-night comedy.\" In an official press release by Turner Broadcasting, it stated that O'Brien had only begun negotiations a week prior to the official announcement of the show. Steve Koonin, President of Turner Entertainment Networks, went on to comment of the announcement, \"Conan has been the comedic voice for a generation. TBS already has a huge audience of young comedy lovers, and Conan's show will give these fans even more reasons to watch our network.\"",

Each card with a question had the answer on the back side. For each correct answer, the child would receive a point and points would equal a prize. After two questions, the experimenter would step out of the room. The next question card is left laying out and hidden cameras would show if the child looked at the answer or not. After a brief period of time, the experimenter returned to the room and asked the child if they peeked at the card. They were then asked what the animal was on the back of the card and the ink color of the card. If the child answered correctly, they were then asked how they knew the answer. Many children who had looked at the card while the experimenter was absent answered with \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. Some children not only lied about peeking at the card but also tried to conceal how they would know the answer, claiming to have known by mere chance. The control group followed a similar process, the only difference is when the experimenter left the children were informed that they could look at the back of the card. This was to ensure that the animal and ink color was easy to remember.",

Prior to the show's broadcast, it was stated that the set for the show, designed by the same designers of Conan's previous sets, John Shaffner and Joe Stewart, would be inspired by The Legally Prohibited Tour, adopting more of a \"theatre\" appearance than the previous shows. Shaffner commented on the choice of the show's chair, stating, \"You find one that you like and then you build it yourself to make it a little shallower and a little more upright and the cushion a little firmer But not too firm or every time the guest sits down they\u2019ll say, 'Oooh this is a hard chair.'\" The rest of the set has been described as being \"filled with warm wood tones and electric blue screens,\" and has been compared to the set of his most recent stint on \"The Tonight Show\". The new set features several differences, however, including a remote-controlled moon, and the backdrop being transformed into a giant blue ocean. In keeping with a change made during \"The Tonight Show\", Andy Richter joins O'Brien during celebrity interviews on the main set rather than remaining behind a lectern after the monologue.",
