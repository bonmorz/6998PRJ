Curdling occurs naturally in cows' milk, if it is left open to air for a few days in a warm environment. Milk is composed of several compounds, primarily fat, protein, and sugar. The protein in milk is normally suspended in a colloidal solution, which means that the small protein molecules float around freely and independently. These floating protein molecules refract light and contribute (with the suspended fat) to the white appearance of milk. Normally these protein molecules repel each other, allowing them to float about without clumping, but when the pH of their solution changes, they can attract one another and form clumps. This is what happens when milk curdles, as the pH drops and becomes more acidic, the protein (casein and others) molecules attract one another and become \"curdles\" floating in a solution of translucent whey.

They are of the Urnfield culture on Lake Neuchatel and date back to 6,000 BC. The earliest direct evidence of cheese-making dates back to 5,500 BC in Kujawy, Poland. For preservation purposes, cheese-making may have begun by the pressing and salting of curdled milk. Curdling milk in an animal's stomach made solid and better-textured curds, leading to the addition of rennet. Dairying existed around 4,000 BC in the grasslands of the Sahara. Hard salted cheese is likely to have accompanied dairying from the outset. It is the only form in which milk can be kept in a hot climate. Animal skins and inflated internal organs provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs. Cheese produced in Europe, where climates are cooler than in the Middle East, required less salt for preservation. With less salt and acidity, the cheese became a suitable environment for useful microbes and molds, giving aged cheeses their pronounced and interesting flavors.",

            "document": "Beecher's Handmade Cheese . Sinko admits that the modern facility with large vats of cheese and milk processing would seem to contradict the word \"Handmade\" in the company name. According to him, all of the cheese is monitored, processed, and prepared by hand, but simply on a larger scale than most artisanal cheesemakers. Unlike most artisan cheeses, Beecher's is made largely with pasteurized milk. Dammeier believes that many people feel raw milk cheeses taste better due to renowned French cheeses, which were historically made of raw milk because the farms were unable to afford pasteurization. \"I've probably tasted 150 different cheeses this year, and I'm convinced that raw milk doesn't create more flavor,\" he said, adding that his cheeses have a more consistent taste from not using raw milk. Nevertheless, Beecher's offers a raw milk version of their Flagship cheese. The cheeses they produce use no artificial ingredients or preservatives. Beecher's typically manufactures up to nine different varieties of cheeses each year, including a combination of their staple brands and various seasonal varieties. At the Beecher's facility, their process for cheese manufacturing is multi-staged. Thousands of gallons of milk are hose-fed from delivery trucks into the manufacturing area, where it is heated to complete the pasteurization of the milk. The heated milk is processed into a stainless steel trough, and the temperature further increased, while the first live cheese cultures and rennet, a coagulant, are added to the developing mixture. According to Amir Rosenblatt, a cheesemaker at Beecher's, the heating and cheese temperatures used in their cooking process are tightly controlled through the sustainable technology of steam power. \"A variation of half a degree [in the pasteurization process] can change the flavor of the cheese,\" he said. Cheesemakers use stainless steel \"rakes\" to then gather the milk mixture, before allowing it to settle briefly, at which point the cheese is cut repeatedly by hand until it achieves a yogurt-like texture and substance. This process is repeated often, until a desired consistency is reached. The mixture is then drawn away to a new trough where most of the remaining water and whey is drained from the cheese. While the whey is continually pulled from the cheese, cheesemakers constantly separate the cheese by hand into smaller and small stacks of cheese curds, which form as the whey is removed. To complete the curding, a large amount of salt is added to cure the cheese and draw still more whey from it. The curds are finally cut into portions, filled into cheese molds, stacked on top of each other, and the remaining excess moisture is forced from the cheese with a constant of pressure for at least 24 hours, before the finished cheese is stored to age. For every 10 pounds (10 kilograms) of milk and whey, Beecher's will typically create 1 pound (1 kilogram) of finished cheese. Beecher's cheeses differ from similar cheeses in that they mix cheese growth cultures in unusual ways. For example, their signature \"Flagship\" cheese includes cultures typically used for non-cheddar cheeses, such as Gruy\u00e8re and Emmental, changing the nature, flavor, and texture of their cheddar. Flagship cheese is produced using a cheddaring process, but owing to a different taste, Beecher's does not call this cheese cheddar. The cheese has been described as having a \"sweet finish and creamy texture\" unlike the tangier cheddars, owing to this being one of the cheeses they create with a mixture of different cheese cultures. After being prepared in blocks and aged for approximately one year, the Flagship\u2014unlike cheddars\u2014lacks a rind, is moister, resembles butter visually, and carries a milky aroma due to being aged in plastic bags. A variant called \"Flagship Reserve\" is aged in cheese cloth in sizes on racks in open air, and is rubbed with butter while being turned daily. This preparation method causes the Reserve to lose up to 12% of its initial weight by the time it is completed. The Reserve is aged for a shorter amount of time, leading to a sharper, nuttier taste and texture, according to \"Food & Wine\" Magazine. Of the of cheese they produce annually, approximately will be Flagship, and only will be Flagship Reserve.",

(They did not seek such technology, probably because of the Confucian taboo on fermented dairy products and other so-called \"barbarian foodstuffs\".)
