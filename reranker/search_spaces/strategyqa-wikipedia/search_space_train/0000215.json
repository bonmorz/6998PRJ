The play was a sold out success, winning the young director the Tesla Award. It starred James Lee Taylor as Nikola Tesla, one of the most respected Serbian-American scientists in the world. The play will soon be moving to London\u2019s West End. Furthermore, Sanja's goal is to take this story a step further in 2014 by directing a documentary movie about the mysterious life of Nikola Tesla. These projects are highly supported by The Tesla Science Foundation and Office for Cooperation with Diaspora and Serbs in the Region.  Nikola Tesla is finally beginning to attract real attention and encourage serious debate nearly 70 years after his death. Nikola Tesla, Serbian-American scientist, the man who lit the world, gave his greatest contribution to science and technological progress of the world as the inventor of the rotating magnetic field and of the complete system of production and distribution of electrical energy (motors, generators) based on the use of alternate currents. His name was given to the SI unit for magnetic induction (\"tesla\"). Tesla also constructed the generators of high-frequency alternate currents and high-voltage coreless transformer known today as \"Tesla Coil\". Sanja has managed to bring to life moments of Tesla's life that the public had yet to see and displayed important moments and sequences of Tesla's life, which for mysterious reasons have remained a well kept secret to date. Tesla whom we might have referred to as holy, sacred, died before he was recognized as someone who truly marked the history of mankind. Sanja's play was supported by the Office for Cooperation with Diaspora and Serbs in the Region, Consulate General of the Republic of Serbia in New York, Vuk Jeremi\u0107 - Serbian physicist, politician and President of the 67th session of United Nations General Assembly, the Tesla Science Foundation, the Nikola Tesla Club, and the Nikola Tesla Inventors Club in the US.",

The Austrian Empire was formed in 1804 to anticipate the dissolution in 1806 of the ancient and maligned Holy Roman Empire by Napoleon. Austria, home of the Habsburg dynasty, had been the central part of the Holy Roman Empire. In the aftermath of Waterloo, Austria was one of the strongest nations in Europe and its foreign minister Metternich became the architect of the Concert of Europe which was able to maintain peace in a divided continent for several decades. Hungary, the land of the Magyars that lies to the east of Austria, was part of the Austrian Empire at that time but it constantly sought control of its own affairs. Austria faced a crisis after its defeat by Prussia in the Seven Weeks War of 1866. To consolidate his power, the Emperor Franz Josef negotiated in March 1867 the Ausgleich (Compromise) with the Magyar ruling classes. As a result, Hungary gained control of its internal affairs and the two states of Austria and Hungary were federated into what became commonly known as the Dual Monarchy. The words Kaiserliche und K\u00f6nigliche on Austrian stamps refer to the Empire of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary, both titles being held by Franz Josef. The Dual Monarchy endured until the end of WWI. Austria and Hungary had separate postal administration from the time of the Ausgleich although it was not until May 1871 that Hungary could issue its first stamps. In the meantime, a set of \"neutral\" stamps were issued that showed a profile of Franz Josef and a value. The fact of the Dual Monarchy was emphasised in stamps issued abroad by Austro-Hungarian post offices or military forces. Hence, reference should be made to Austria and Hungary separately re home issues and to the various Austro-Hungarian entries for overseas issues.",

Serbian pretensions in creating a South Slavic state (Yugoslavism as opposed to Austro-Slavism) put fear in Austria-Hungary of potential devastation of the Austro-Hungarian empire. On the other hand, Russia became increasingly disappointed in Bulgaria, where the rulers of the German dynasties, Alexander of Battenberg and from 1887 Ferdinand I, pursued policies that Russia opposed. The visit to Saint Petersburg of Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph and his conference with Nicholas II of Russia in 1897 heralded a secret agreement between the two empires to honour and seek to maintain the \"status quo\" in the Balkans, which was in line with Vienna\u2032s attempts to forestall an emergence of a large Slavic state in the region.

To improve his country's economic circumstances, Bethlen undertook development of industry. He imposed tariffs on finished goods and earmarked the revenues to subsidize new industries. Bethlen squeezed the agricultural sector to increase cereal exports, which generated foreign currency to pay for imports critical to the industrial sector. Further compounding Hungary's problems was the fact that of its four neighbors, three (Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia) were enemies and kept troops stationed on their borders at all times, even though Hungary had an army of only 20,000 men. The fourth, Austria, was a struggling nation and little more than an economic competitor. In 1924, after the white terror had waned and Hungary had gained admission to the League of Nations (1922), the Bethlen government was able to borrow a 50 million USD loan from the League, which in order to protect its investment placed the country in effective receivership, even placing an American banker, Jeremiah Smith, in charge of the country's finances.
