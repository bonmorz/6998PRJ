The play was a sold out success, winning the young director the Tesla Award. It starred James Lee Taylor as Nikola Tesla, one of the most respected Serbian-American scientists in the world. The play will soon be moving to London\u2019s West End. Furthermore, Sanja's goal is to take this story a step further in 2014 by directing a documentary movie about the mysterious life of Nikola Tesla. These projects are highly supported by The Tesla Science Foundation and Office for Cooperation with Diaspora and Serbs in the Region.  Nikola Tesla is finally beginning to attract real attention and encourage serious debate nearly 70 years after his death. Nikola Tesla, Serbian-American scientist, the man who lit the world, gave his greatest contribution to science and technological progress of the world as the inventor of the rotating magnetic field and of the complete system of production and distribution of electrical energy (motors, generators) based on the use of alternate currents. His name was given to the SI unit for magnetic induction (\"tesla\"). Tesla also constructed the generators of high-frequency alternate currents and high-voltage coreless transformer known today as \"Tesla Coil\". Sanja has managed to bring to life moments of Tesla's life that the public had yet to see and displayed important moments and sequences of Tesla's life, which for mysterious reasons have remained a well kept secret to date. Tesla whom we might have referred to as holy, sacred, died before he was recognized as someone who truly marked the history of mankind. Sanja's play was supported by the Office for Cooperation with Diaspora and Serbs in the Region, Consulate General of the Republic of Serbia in New York, Vuk Jeremi\u0107 - Serbian physicist, politician and President of the 67th session of United Nations General Assembly, the Tesla Science Foundation, the Nikola Tesla Club, and the Nikola Tesla Inventors Club in the US.",

Some, however, suggest that the Cotton Famine was mostly due to overproduction and price inflation caused by an expectation of future shortage. Prior to the Civil War, Lancashire companies issued surveys to find new cotton-growing countries if the Civil War were to occur and reduce American exports. India was deemed to be the country capable of growing the necessary amounts.
