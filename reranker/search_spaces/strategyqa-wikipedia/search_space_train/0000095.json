Each correct answer earns a monetary award, and allows the team to maintain control, while an incorrect answer, or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turns control over to the opponents. However, the team can dare their opponents to answer the question, doubling its value; in response, the opponents can double dare for quadruple the original value. When the team in control is challenged to a double dare, they have to either answer or compete in a physical challenge. An incorrect answer, or not responding within approximately five seconds on a dare or double dare, awards both control and the appropriate amount of money to the team that issues it. The second round plays the same as the first, with question values doubled. On the original \"Double Dare\" and \"Super Sloppy Double Dare\", a question was initially worth $10. On \"Family Double Dare\" and \"Double Dare 2000\", a question was initially worth $25. On the 2018 \"Double Dare\", a question is initially worth $50.",

Players must identify which of the two shown musicians the trivia fact corresponds to. When two photos with golden frames are placed side-by-side, that means that a correct answer to that question is worth five points. Teams must take turns in this round; when a team gets an answer wrong, or when a team gets a golden-frame question correct, it's the other team's turn. A series of events, song titles, or musicians' names are displayed, and the teams must be arranged smallest to largest or chronologically. As in round three, it is the other team's turn when the answering team gives a wrong answer. Five words or phrases all referring to the same musician or band appear onscreen. Both teams try to name the musician or band the clues refer to. The topic the final question will be about is displayed. Both teams then bet 5, 15, 30, or all of their points. The question appears onscreen, and the teams discreetly give their answer with the remote. If they answer the question correctly, they gain that number of points, but if their answer is incorrect, they lose that number of points.",

This was later changed to allow contestants to buzz-in at any time if they knew the answer, though the host would immediately stop reading the question at that point.",

The question was then read to the panel and each celebrity gave an answer. Two of the answers were wrong (\"balderdash\"), and one celebrity had the correct answer (\"truth\"). Once the answers were given, the contestants chose a celebrity and whether they thought their answer was truth or balderdash. Correctly identifying a balderdash answer added the amount of the wager to the contestant's score, while correctly identifying an answer as truth paid off at double the wager. Incorrect answers simply lost the amount of the wager.",

On the Australian versions, McGuire replaces the phrase with \"Lock it in?\"; likewise, the Indian version's hosts have used varying \"lock\" catchphrases. There are also a number of other non-English versions of \"Millionaire\" where the host does not ask \"[Is that your] final answer?\" or a literal translation thereof. Besides the \"final answer\" question, other catchphrases used on the show include the contestants' requests to use lifelines, such as \"I'd like to phone a friend\"; and a line that Tarrant spoke whenever a contestant was struggling with a particular question, \"Some questions are only easy if you know the answer.\"",
