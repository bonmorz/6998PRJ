Collections prior to Terry's (except for Davis and Tozer's much earlier and contrived-sounding settings) had not provided enough verses to create \"full\" songs, and it is unlikely that performers would venture to improvise new verses in the manner of traditional shantymen. By 1926, it had become a custom at the Seven Seas Club in London to hold a shanty sing-along after the club's monthly dinners. By 1928, commercial recordings of shanties, performed in the manner of classical concert singing, had been released on HMV, Vocalion, Parlophone, Edison, Aco, and Columbia labels; many were realizations of scores from Terry's collection.

There were derived from varied sources, including dances, folk songs, polkas, waltzes and even West African work-songs. Since different songs were useful for different tasks they are traditionally divided into three main categories, short haul shanties, for tasks requiring quick pulls over a relatively short time; halyard shanties, for heavier work requiring more set-up time between pulls; and Capstan shanties, for long, repetitive tasks requiring a sustained rhythm, but not involving working the lines. Famous shanties include, the 'Drunken Sailor' and 'Blow the Man Down'. There was some interest in sea shanties in the first revival from figures like Percy Grainger. In the second revival A. L.

One of the earliest references to shanty-like songs that has been discovered was made by an anonymous \"steerage passenger\" in a log of a voyage of an East India Company ship, entitled \"The Quid\" (1832).

While this practice was analogous to the practice of what is later called singing \"capstan shanties,\" the form of these verses is not particularly similar to later shanties. These songs do not appear to correspond to any shanty known from later eras. It is possible that the long, monotonous task of heaving the capstan had long inspired the singing of time-passing songs of various sorts, such as those in \"The Quid\". For example, the composition of capstan-style \"sailor songs\" by Norwegian poet Henrik Wergeland as early as 1838 implies that Scandinavians also used such songs.

Somewhere between these perspectives was Cecil Sharp's, whose \"English Folk-Chanteys\" (1914) was published in the same year, and was based on shanties he collected from aged English sailors in Britain.

The title of Sharp's work reflects his project of collecting and grouping shanties as part of what he conceived to be a rather continuous English folk song tradition. Sharp states in the introduction that he deliberately excluded shanties which were obviously (i.e. to him) born of popular songs. This idea is problematic when one considers that the popular songs that were feeding shanties were largely American and based in real or imagined African-American musical traits. However, Sharp believed that by eliminating such shanties based on popular songs, he could concentrate those that were \"folk\" songs. Of his own admission, Sharp lacked any shantying or sea experience to intuitively judge shanties like someone such as Bullen, however he offers his objectivity, recording precisely what was sung to him, as consolation. While Sharp's manner of documenting shanties was more or less objective, the field of his research and his biases in what to collect certainly influenced the outcome of this study.

Masefield desired to connect shanties with much older English traditions and literature, and his characterization of individual items as such would prove attractive to later enthusiasts.

Nearing retirement, Whall recalled the sea songs of his youth, combining them perhaps with songs from sailors he had met in the Liverpool and Bristol areas in his latter years. At first he published a selection of songs in the \"Nautical Magazine\" and in \"Yachting Monthly\" but then resolved to compile them all in a single book, writing: \"I set myself a plain task, namely to write down these songs, music and words, as I heard them sung at sea by sailors.\" He enrolled the help of his younger brother Roughton Henry Whall (1862\u20131933), an organist and music teacher (Mus. Bac., FRCO) living in Stroud, Glos as well as his niece Veronica Whall (b1885), the young daughter of another brother Christopher Whall, a stained glass artist in Dorking. Roughton Whall supplied the musical settings and Veronica Whall the illustrations for the book, which came out in 1910 and quickly went through several editions. It contained 50 songs, half of which would find their way into most modern shanty books or repertoires.  Whall's book preceded the collection of another genuine seafarer Frank Thomas Bullen (1857\u20131915). Bullen went to sea in 1869 aged 12 and later became a prolific novelist. At the end of his life he set out 42 shanties in his interesting book. Whall also preceded the folksong collector Cecil Sharp, who picked up shanties from Somerset singers Henry Rapsey and Henry Bailey in Bridgwater as well as a massive store of songs from John Short ('Yankee Jack') at Watchet. Sharp's book \"English Folk-Chanteys\" came out in 1914. Collections of French shanties were made by Captain Armand Hayet in 1927 and American songs by Joanna Carver Colcord in 1924. Many modern scholars, however, still reference Capt Whall's book in their investigations into sea songs and shanties. Richard Runciman Terry in his book \"The Shanty Book Part One\" comments that 'of all these collections (of shanties) Capt. Whall's is the only one which a sailor could accept as authoritative'.",

            "document": "Sea shanty . The next revival in shanties occurred as part of the Anglophone folk music revival of the mid-20th century. The American folk revival group The Almanac Singers were recruited by Alan Lomax to record several shanties for the 1941 album Deep Sea Chanteys and Whaling Ballads. In Britain, the incorporation of shanties into the folk revival repertoire was largely led by A.L. Lloyd starting in the 1950s. An amateur folklorist, Lloyd discarded the earlier classical style of presentations in favor of a more \"authentic\" performance style. He was generally mysterious about the sources of his shanty arrangements; he obviously referred to collections by editors like Sharp, Colcord, and Doerflinger, however it is often unclear when and whether his versions were based in field experience or his private invention. Lloyd's album \"The Singing Sailor\" (1955) with Ewan MacColl was an early milestone, which made an impression on Stan Hugill when he was preparing his 1961 collection, particularly as the performance style it embodied was considered more appropriate than that of earlier commercial recordings. Many other performers followed, creating influential versions and interpretations of shanties that persist today. For example, Lloyd's personal interpretation of \"South Australia\" was taken up by the Irish folk revival group The Clancy Brothers, from which this version spread to countless folk performers to become established as the \"standard\" form of what is usually presented as a \"traditional\" shanty. Through the mass distribution of particular shanty forms through recordings and clubs, the Folk Revival has had the effect of creating an impression of rather consistent forms of texts and tunes\u2014a sharp contrast to the highly variable and often improvised nature of work-based shanty singing. Another effect, due to the fact that most folk performers sang shanties along with other genres, is that shanty repertoire was ever more incorporated within the generic fold of \"folk song,\" and their distinctive use, manner of performance, and identity were co-opted.",

            "document": "Sea shanty . A few of the editors of early shanty collections provided arrangements for pianoforte accompaniment with their shanties. While this may have simply been a customary way of presenting songs or attempting to frame their tonality, it may also suggest they hoped their examples could be performed, as well. One of the earliest shanty collections, Davis and Tozer's \"Sailor Songs or 'Chanties\"' (which circulated in the early 1890s), included such accompaniment, along with safe, \"drawing room\" style lyrics. It is unknown whether any actual performances were based on this otherwise influential work, however, the proceedings from a meeting of the Manchester Literary Club, 4 February 1895, record an instance of laypersons attempting to recreate shanty performance at that early date. In general, shanty performance by laypersons, up through the first two decades of the 20th century, would have been hindered by the lack of suitable resources, if not lack of interest.",
