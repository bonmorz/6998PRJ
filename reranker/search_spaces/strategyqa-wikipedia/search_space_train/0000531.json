His name is not revealed in the series until the Season 8 finale when, upon J.D.'s first time asking about it, he simply says his name is Glenn Matthews. This is also speculated to be false for two reasons: first, after J.D. leaves the shot, an orderly addresses the Janitor as \"Tommy\"; and second, while watching \"The Fugitive\" with Carla and Danni (Dr. Cox's sister-in-law, played by Tara Reid) in the Season 3 episode 'My Friend The Doctor', J.D. notices the real-life Flynn's character in the train scene. When the Janitor confirms he was in the movie at the end of the episode, some speculated the Janitor's real name in \"Scrubs\" is actually Neil Flynn. Flynn was a series regular with \"Scrubs\" through the first eight seasons.

His review established most of the presently known family and genera names for the extinct lemurs. Despite the taxonomic clarification, subfossil postcrania from different genera, particularly \"Megaladapis\", \"Palaeopropithecus\" and \"Hadropithecus\", continued to be incorrectly paired and sometimes assigned to non-primates. Since subfossil remains were often dredged from marshes one by one, pairing skulls with other bones was often guesswork based on size-matching, and was not very accurate as a consequence. Even as late as the 1950s, bones of non-primates were attributed to subfossil lemurs. One reconstruction of the confounded subfossil remains by paleontologist Herbert F. Standing depicted \"Palaeopropithecus\" as an aquatic animal that swam near the surface, keeping its eyes, ears, and nostrils slightly above water. Postcranial remains of \"Palaeopropithecus\" had previously been paired with \"Megaladapis\" by Guillaume Grandidier, who viewed it as a giant tree sloth, which he named \"Bradytherium\". Standing's aquatic theory was supported by Italian paleontologist Giuseppe Sera, who reconstructed \"Palaeopropithecus\" as an \"arboreal-aquatic acrobat\" that not only swam in water but climbed trees and dove from there into the water. Sera took the aquatic theory further in 1938 by including other extinct lemurs, including \"Megaladapis\", which he viewed as a thin ray-like swimmer that fed on mollusks and crustaceans while concealed underwater. It was primarily the paleontologist Charles Lamberton who correctly paired many of the confused subfossils, although others had also helped address problems of association and taxonomic synonyms. Lamberton also refuted Guillaume Grandidier's sloth theory for \"Megaladapis\", as well as the aquatic lemur theory of Standing and Sera.",
