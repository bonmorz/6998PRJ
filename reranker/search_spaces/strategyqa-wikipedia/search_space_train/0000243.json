One scholar defends Julius II's patronage by stating: \"\u201cIt must not be forgotten that not all messages conveyed in works commissioned by a patron, let alone those merely addressed to him, can be read as a communication by the patron of his thinking and claims and aspirations. To say this is not to deny that messages may be read into them, but it should not be assumed that patrons would necessarily have cared about or understood or been motivated by theories and statements about their power and authority that may be coded into the works of art they paid for\". \" (Gosman, 61)",

Some see the parable as being Jesus' message to people that if they enjoy the advantages of a state such as Caesar's, as distinct from God's authority (for instance, by using its legal tender), they can't subsequently choose to ignore the laws of such a state. Henry David Thoreau writes in \"Civil Disobedience\": Christ answered the Herodians according to their condition. \"Show me the tribute-money,\" said he; \u2013 and one took a penny out of his pocket; \u2013 If you use money which has the image of Caesar on it, and which he has made current and valuable, that is, if you are men of the State, and gladly enjoy the advantages of Caesar's government, then pay him back some of his own when he demands it; \"Render therefore to Caesar that which is Caesar's and to God those things which are God's\" \u2013 leaving them no wiser than before as to which was which; for they did not wish to know. Mennonite Dale Glass-Hess wrote: It is inconceivable to me that Jesus would teach that some spheres of human activity lie outside the authority of God. Are we to heed Caesar when he says to go to war or support war-making when Jesus says in other places that we shall not kill? No! My perception of this incident is that Jesus does not answer the question about the morality of paying taxes to Caesar, but that he throws it back on the people to decide. When the Jews produce a denarius at Jesus' request, they demonstrate that they are already doing business with Caesar on Caesar's terms. I read Jesus' statement, \"Give to Caesar\u2026\" as meaning \"Have you incurred a debt in regard to Caesar! Then you better pay it off.\" The Jews had already compromised themselves. Likewise for us: we may refuse to serve Caesar as soldiers and even try to resist paying for Caesar's army. But the fact is that by our lifestyles we've run up a debt with Caesar, who has felt constrained to defend the interests that support our lifestyles. Now he wants paid back, and it's a little late to say that we don't owe anything. We've already compromised ourselves. If we're going to play Caesar's games, then we should expect to have to pay for the pleasure of their enjoyment. But if we are determined to avoid those games, then we should be able to avoid paying for them. Mohandas K. Gandhi shared this perspective. He wrote: Jesus evaded the direct question put to him because it was a trap. He was in no way bound to answer it. He therefore asked to see the coin for taxes. And then said with withering scorn, \"How can you who traffic in Caesar's coins and thus receive what to you are benefits of Caesar's rule refuse to pay taxes?\" Jesus' whole preaching and practice point unmistakably to noncooperation, which necessarily includes nonpayment of taxes.",

The impossibility of answering truly the question whether the 100th (or 10,000th) decimal in the evaluation of Pi is or is not a 9, splendidly illustrates how impossible it is to predicate truth in abstraction from actual knowing and actual purpose. For the question cannot be answered until the decimal is calculated. Until then no one knows what it is, or rather will turn out to be. And no one will calculate it, until it serves some purpose to do so, and some one therefore interests himself in the calculation. And so until then the truth remains uncertain: there is no 'true' answer, because there is no actual context in which the question has really been raised. We have merely a number of conflicting possibilities, not even claims to truth, and there is no decision. Yet a decision is possible if an experiment is performed. But his experiment presupposes a desire to know. It will only be made if the point becomes one which it is practically important to decide. Normally no doubt it does not become such, because for the actual purposes of the sciences it makes no difference whether we suppose the figure to be 9 or something else. I.e. the truth to, say, the 99th decimal, is ' true enough ' for our purposes, and the 100th is a matter of indifference. But let that indifference cease, and the question become important, and the ' truth ' will at once become ' useful '. Prof. Taylor's illustration therefore conclusively proves that in an actual context and as an actual question there is no true answer to be got until the truth has become useful. This point is illustrated also by the context Prof. Taylor has himself suggested. For he has made the question about the 100th decimal important by making the refutation of the whole pragmatist theory of knowledge depend on it. And what nobler use could the 100th decimal have in his eyes? If in consequence of this interest he will set himself to work it out, he will discover this once useless, but now most useful, truth, and\u2014triumphantly refute his own contention!",

Plato answered his own question by stating that knowledge is present at birth and all information learned by a person is merely a recollection of something the soul has already learned previously, which is called the Theory of Recollection or Platonic epistemology. This answer could be further justified by a paradox: If a person knows something, they don't need to question it, and if a person does not know something, they don't know to question it. Plato says that if one did not previously know something, then they cannot learn it. He describes learning as a passive process, where information and knowledge are ironed into the soul over time. However, Plato's theory elicits even more questions about knowledge: If we can only learn something when we already had the knowledge impressed onto our souls, then how did our souls gain that knowledge in the first place?

The presence of niches in the walls are assumed to have been bookcases and have been shown to be sufficiently deep to have contained ancient scrolls. There is little documentation from the writers of the time that there did exist definitive public libraries maintained in the baths, but records have been found that indicated a slave from the imperial household was labelled \u201cmaintenance man of the Greek library of the baths\u201d (vilicus thermarum bybliothecae Graecae).

A completely different interpretation of Jesus words \"render unto Caesar what is Caesar's...etc.\" has been proposed by some writers (see, for example, Jeffrey Barr, Ned Netterville, Darrell Anderson, Timmothy Patton. This same incident with small differences is also recorded in the Gospels of Matthew (22:15-22) and Luke (20:20-26). Luke's Gospel makes it abundantly clear what the purpose was of asking Jesus whether or not to pay Caesar's tax, to wit: \"They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said, so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor.\" Obviously, the chief priests who devised the trap were confident Jesus would denounce Caesar's tax (as a violation of God's commandment against stealing [i.e., extortion] including taxation). Clearly, they did not think Jesus would endorse Caesar tax. There is no basis in the Gospels, or any other history, for supposing that the chief priests thought Jesus might say, \"You should pay Caesar's tax (a form of extortion and violation of God's Commandment against stealing. ).\" Since Pilate was Caesar's commissioner of taxation for Judea, Jesus' denunciation of the tax would earn him a death sentence. In order to know what Jesus meant by his ambiguous response it is necessary to know what Jesus thought belongs to Caesar and what belongs to God respectively. Since Jesus repeatedly justified himself and his teaching by reference to sacred Jewish Scripture, his thoughts on the subject of who owns what would also be influenced by or based on the authority of the Bible. And Scripture states in Psalm 24, verse 1, \"The earth is the Lord\u2019s, and everything in it...\", which leaves nothing whatsoever for poor old Caesar, and nothing is exactly what Jesus was telling his listeners they should pay to Caesar in taxes. The spies were bamboozled by his response because they obviously were not familiar with Scripture, but when they told their bosses what Jesus had said, the chief priest who knew Scripture were not fooled. So the next day they sent armed men to arrest Jesus at Gethsemane. They dragged him before Pilate and said to him, \"We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar...He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here.\" (Luke 23:2-5 ) Another point opposed to the foregoing interpretation is that the coin in question obviously did not belong to Caesar but rather to the man who produced it when Jesus asked, and whose it was. Coins are bearer instruments that belong to their possessor. (see,)",

When he does finally answer a question, it is the different one of why he has not written the book earlier. His reasons are that he saw little need to write whilst there was still a live prophet amongst them and because, if he wrote, he had to make reference to his own experience which he felt reluctant to do. Just what this experience was that might make his fellow believers question if he were a fit and proper person to exhort them to righteousness, he naturally doesn't say.

You're into the spiritual domain when you ask ultimate questions\u2014'what's the ultimate meaning of life?', when you deal with totalities\u2014'What is the entire world like? What is my whole life like? How should I live my whole life?' And 'boundary conditions' is a little harder to explain, but think in terms of, \"When have I reached the limit?\" For example, if I tell you that I know something, you may ask me how I know and I may be able to give you an answer. Then when I give you the answer, that has to be something else that I know, and so you may ask me about it, and I may give you an answer. But ultimately, we reach some kind of end because I can't give you answers forever. All knowledge has that structure, that you can back up some knowledge with other knowledge, and you can back that up with some other, but there is never an infinite sequence of backing up. You do reach an end point. The fact that you reach an end point is an example of a boundary condition with respect to knowledge, that knowledge is not founded on an infinite set of foundations, nor is it founded on a secure foundation. A secure foundation is just some other fact that one can ask questions about. So knowledge starts somewhere, and it doesn't start from further knowledge, ultimately. And it's in dealing with such questions as, 'Where does our knowledge come from? What is its foundations? What kind of confidence can we have in it?'\u00a0\u2013 these kinds of questions, I think are what you're dealing with when you think of a religion.\"",

However, things in themselves may exist and there may be other ways of knowing them, apart from our experience. We must guard against assuming that the limits of our reason are the limits of the possibility of things in themselves. To do this, we must determine the boundary of the use of our reason. We want to know about the soul. We want to know about the size and origin of the world, and whether we have free will. We want to know about a Supreme Being. Our reason must stay within the boundary of appearances but it assumes that there can be knowledge of the things\u2013in\u2013themselves that exist beyond that boundary. Mathematics and natural science stay within the boundary of appearances and have no need to go beyond. The nature of reason is that it wants to go beyond appearances and wants to know the basis of appearances. Reason never stops asking \"why?.\" Reason won't rest until it knows the complete condition for the whole series of conditions. Complete conditions are thought of as being the transcendental Ideas of the immaterial Soul, the whole world, and the Supreme Being. In order to think about these beings of mere thought, we symbolically attribute sensuous properties to them. In this way, the Ideas mark the bounds of human reason. They exist at the boundary because we speak and think about them as if they possess the properties of both appearances and things\u2013in\u2013themselves.",

He wrote at least sixteen books, but books 7\u201310 and parts of books 5, 6, 11 and 16 are missing. Book 6 ends with the death of Tiberius and books 7 to 12 presumably covered the reigns of Caligula and Claudius. The remaining books cover the reign of Nero, perhaps until his death in June 68 or until the end of that year to connect with the \"Histories\". The second half of book 16 is missing, ending with the events of 66. We do not know whether Tacitus completed the work; he died before he could complete his planned histories of Nerva and Trajan and no record survives of the work on Augustus Caesar and the beginnings of the Roman Empire, with which he had planned to finish his work. The \"Annals\" is one of the earliest secular historical records to mention Christ, which Tacitus does in connection with Nero's persecution of the Christians. Tacitus wrote three works with a more limited scope. \"Agricola\", a biography of his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola; the \"Germania\", a monograph on the lands and tribes of barbarian Germania; and the \"Dialogus\", a dialogue on the art of rhetoric.",

A main overriding theme is human emotions and how they are constructed and what they mean. This theme is there to be questioned not to be answered. Another main theme is that of the human consciousness and how the brain is able to construct it. This play is asking whether we should be allowed to figure out exactly how the brain works, essentially pitting every emotion thought and movement to a function in the brain, essentially turning all the mystery in to the light and making the brain seem like a machine. This is a controversial idea because to many people who study religion this could debunk their religious teachings. Religions tend to heavily rely on the idea of a spirit or a soul and if the brain were demystified then there would most likely be no room for a soul and this could lead to a large rebellion against the church. By keeping the brain human and not a machine it leaves room for a \u201cmiracle\u201d or other unexplained happening which leaves room for religion. With the advancements in science we will most likely some day know exactly how the brain works but right now we are far from the answer but get closer all the time. The biggest road block is going to be with human testing because it is seen as immoral but without it the advancements in science may not happen. Whether that is to be allowed is a question up to the moral of the human populous as a whole.",
