In a relational database this will require several separate searches through the movies and actors tables, doing another search on submarine movies, finding all the actors in those movies, and then comparing the (large) collected results.

            "document": "Clark Gable . After Joan Crawford's third divorce, she and Gable resumed their relationship and lived together for a brief time. Gable was acclaimed for his performance in \"The Hucksters\" (1947), a satire of postwar Madison Avenue corruption and immorality. A very public and brief romance with Paulette Goddard occurred after that. In 1949, Gable married Sylvia Ashley, a British model and actress previously married to Douglas Fairbanks. The relationship was profoundly unsuccessful; they divorced in 1952. Soon followed \"Never Let Me Go\" (1953), opposite Gene Tierney. Tierney was a favorite of Gable and he was very disappointed when she was replaced in \"Mogambo\" (because of her mental health problems) by Grace Kelly. \"Mogambo\" (1953), directed by John Ford, was a somewhat sanitized remake of his earlier Pre-Code film \"Red Dust\", with Jean Harlow and Mary Astor, which had been a greater success. Gable's on-location affair with Grace Kelly (1929\u20131982), who was young enough to be his daughter, gradually ended after filming was completed. Gable became increasingly unhappy with what he considered mediocre roles offered him by MGM, while the studio regarded his salary as excessive. Studio head Louis B. Mayer was fired in 1951 amid slumping Hollywood production and revenue, due primarily to the rising popularity of television. Studio chiefs struggled to cut costs. Many MGM stars were fired or their contracts were not renewed, including Greer Garson and Judy Garland. In 1953, Gable refused to renew his contract and began to work independently. His first two films in this new situation were \"Soldier of Fortune\" and \"The Tall Men\" (both 1955), which were profitable, although only modest successes. In 1955, Gable married his fifth wife, Kay Spreckels (n\u00e9e Kathleen Williams), a thrice-married former fashion model and actress who had previously been married to sugar-refining heir Adolph B. Spreckels Jr. Gable became stepfather to her son Bunker Spreckels, who went on to live a notorious celebrity lifestyle in the late 1960s and early 1970s surfing scene, ultimately leading to his early death in 1977. In 1955, Gable formed a production company with Jane Russell and her husband Bob Waterfield, and they produced \"The King and Four Queens\" (1956), Gable's only production. He found producing and acting to be too taxing on his health, and he was beginning to manifest a noticeable tremor, particularly in long takes. His next project was \"Band of Angels\" (1957), with relative newcomer Sidney Poitier and Yvonne De Carlo; it was not well received despite Gable's role's similarities to Rhett Butler. \"Newsweek\" said, \"Here is a movie so bad that it must be seen to be disbelieved.\" Next, he paired with Doris Day in \"Teacher's Pet\" (1958), shot in black and white. The film was good enough to bring Gable more movie offers, including \"Run Silent, Run Deep\" (also 1958), with co-star and producer Burt Lancaster, which featured his first on-screen death since 1937, and which garnered good reviews. Gable started to receive television offers, but rejected them outright. At 57, Gable finally acknowledged, \"Now it's time I acted my age\". His next two films were light comedies for Paramount: \"But Not for Me\" (1959) with Carroll Baker and \"It Started in Naples\" (1960) with Sophia Loren. The last one, despite an icy critical reception, was a good box-office success and was nominated for an Academy award and two Golden Globes. Filmed mostly on location in Italy, it was Gable's last film released in color.",

In the 1939 film version of \"Gone with the Wind\", for the role of Rhett Butler, Clark Gable was an almost immediate favorite for both the public and producer David O. Selznick (except for Gable himself). But as Selznick had no male stars under long-term contract, he needed to go through the process of negotiating to borrow an actor from another studio. Gary Cooper was thus Selznick's first choice, because Cooper's contract with Samuel Goldwyn involved a common distribution company, United Artists, with which Selznick had an eight-picture deal. However, Goldwyn remained noncommittal in negotiations. Warner Bros. offered a package of Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, and Olivia de Havilland for the lead roles in return for the distribution rights. When Gary Cooper turned down the role of Rhett Butler, he was passionately against it. He was quoted saying, \"\"Gone With The Wind\" is going to be the biggest flop in Hollywood history. I\u2019m glad it\u2019ll be Clark Gable who\u2019s falling flat on his nose, not Gary Cooper\". But by then Selznick was determined to get Clark Gable, and eventually found a way to borrow him from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Selznick's father-in-law, MGM chief Louis B. Mayer, offered in May 1938 to fund half of the movie's budget in return for a powerful package: 50% of the profits would go to MGM, the movie's distribution would be credited to MGM's parent company, Loew's, Inc., and Loew's would receive 15 percent of the movie's gross income. Selznick accepted this offer in August, and Gable was cast. But the arrangement to release through MGM meant delaying the start of production until Selznick International completed its eight-picture contract with United Artists. Gable was reluctant to play the role. At the time, he was wary of potentially disappointing a public who had formed a clear impression of the character that he might not necessarily convey in his performance.",
