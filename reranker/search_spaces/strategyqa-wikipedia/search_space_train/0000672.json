Similarly, in the Mesopotamian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", the bustle of humanity disturbs the gods, who decide to send a flood.

Although Shem is unanimously declared by the Rabbis to have been the youngest son of Noah, he is always named first, being the most important of the three brothers. He was the ancestor of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; he was also a priest, a prophet, and one of the eight righteous mentioned twice in Genesis xi 10; they were allotted a portion both in this world and in the world to come. Shem is styled \"the great one\" According to Genesis R. xxx. 6, it was Shem who offered the sacrifices on the altar after Noah came out of the ark, because Noah, having been crippled by a lion, was unfit for the priestly office. Noah gave the priestly garments, which he had inherited from Adam, to Shem. Shem is extolled by the Rabbis for his filial devotion in covering his father's nakedness. Although his brother Japheth helped in this act, Shem suggested and began it; his brother did not arrive on the scene until Shem was already on his way with the garment. Noah, in blessing these two sons said, \"blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem\", giving special significance to Shem because Shem would be the forefather of the Jewish people.",
