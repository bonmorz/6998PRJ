Ballad of Easy Rider is the eighth album by the American rock band the Byrds and was released in November 1969 on Columbia Records (\"see\" 1969 in music). The album was named after the song \"Ballad of Easy Rider\", which had been written by the Byrds' guitarist and singer, Roger McGuinn (with help from Bob Dylan), as the theme song for the 1969 film, \"Easy Rider\". The title was also chosen in an attempt to capitalize on the commercial success of the film, although the majority of the music on the album had no connection with it. Nonetheless, the association with \"Easy Rider\" heightened the Byrds' public profile and resulted in \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" becoming the band's highest charting album for two years in the U.S.",

Recording sessions for \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" were produced by Terry Melcher, who had also worked as the Byrds' producer during 1965, on their \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" albums. The band decided to work with Melcher again as a result of their dissatisfaction with Bob Johnston's production on their previous album, \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\", and on their recent single, \"Lay Lady Lay\". Melcher was happy to accept the band's invitation to produce the album but his one stipulation was that he would also take on management duties for the Byrds, not wishing for a repeat of the conflict he had experienced with Jim Dickson, the group's original manager, in 1965. Melcher's return to the producer's chair began an association with the band that would last until \"Byrdmaniax\" in 1971, much longer than his first tenure as the Byrds' producer. In early 1969, the script writer and leading actor of \"Easy Rider\", Peter Fonda, asked Bob Dylan to compose a theme song for the film. Dylan declined but as a consolation he offered the lines - \"The river flows, it flows to the sea/Wherever that river goes, that's where I want to be/Flow, river, flow\" - which he hurriedly scribbled onto a napkin, before telling Fonda to \"give that to McGuinn.\" The fragment was dutifully passed on to the Byrds' guitarist, Roger McGuinn, who added his own lyrical and musical contributions to fashion a completed song, which he titled \"Ballad of Easy Rider\". After seeing a private screening of \"Easy Rider\" and realizing that he had been named as co-writer of the film's theme song, Dylan demanded that his writing credit be removed, leading McGuinn to theorize in later years that Dylan had disliked the film's ending and anti-hero motif. In 2000 McGuinn recounted to Jud Cost the story of how Dylan disowned credit for the song: \"I got a call from Dylan at three o'clock in the morning going 'What's this? I don't want this credit. Take it off.'\" Another possible reason for Dylan insisting that his name be removed from the song's credits may have been a suspicion that his name was being exploited to boost the film's credibility. Two versions of the song \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" were released. The first was the version included on the \"Easy Rider\" soundtrack album, which was listed as a solo performance by Roger McGuinn, although it also featured fellow Byrd Gene Parsons on harmonica. The second was the recording by the Byrds, which was included on the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album and released as a single. The version of the song found on the soundtrack album and used in the film is a completely different take to the version released by the Byrds.",

Musically the album consolidated and streamlined the band's country rock sound, consisting mostly of cover versions and traditional material, with three self-penned original songs. The first single to be released from the album was the title track, issued in October 1969 in America and reaching number 65 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. Composed primarily by McGuinn, with some input from Bob Dylan (although not credited), \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" was written as the theme tune for the 1969 countercultural film \"Easy Rider\". However the Byrds' recording of the song does not appear in the film, instead an acoustic version credited to McGuinn alone was used. However the Byrds' song \"Wasn't Born to Follow\" from \"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\" album was featured in \"Easy Rider\" and also included on the \"Easy Rider\" soundtrack album in August 1969. The Byrds' association with the film heightened their public profile and when the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album was released in November 1969, it peaked at number 36 in the U.S. and number 41 in the UK, becoming the band's highest charting album for two years in America. A second single taken from the album, \"Jesus Is Just Alright\", was released in December 1969 but it only managed to reach number 97. Despite this lack of commercial success, the Doobie Brothers' later hit version of \"Jesus Is Just Alright\" features an arrangement that was heavily influenced by the Byrds' recording. Just prior to the release of \"Ballad of Easy Rider\", the Byrds underwent yet another change in personnel when bassist John York was asked to leave the band in September 1969. York had become disenchanted with his role in the Byrds and had voiced his reluctance to perform material that had been written and recorded by the group before he had joined. The rest of the band had begun to doubt his commitment and so, a consensus was reached among the other three members that York should be fired. He was replaced, at the suggestion of Parsons and White, by Skip Battin, a freelance session musician and one-time member of the duo Skip & Flip. Battin's recruitment marked the last personnel change to the group for almost three years and as a result, the McGuinn\u2013White\u2013Parsons\u2013Battin line-up became the most stable and longest-lived of any configuration of the Byrds.",

Upon its release, the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album revived the Byrds' commercial fortunes, giving the band their first U.S. Top 40 album since \"Younger Than Yesterday\" in 1967.

Columbia Records' was eager to capitalize on this new-found popularity and launched an advertising campaign for the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album, proclaiming \"The movie gave you the facts, the Ballad interprets them.\" However, with the exception of the title track, none of the songs on the album had much to do with the film.

Recording sessions for \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" were produced by Terry Melcher, who had also worked as the Byrds' producer during 1965, on their \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" albums. The band decided to work with Melcher again as a result of their dissatisfaction with Bob Johnston's production on their previous album, \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\", and on their recent single, \"Lay Lady Lay\". Melcher was happy to accept the band's invitation to produce the album but his one stipulation was that he would also take on management duties for the Byrds, not wishing for a repeat of the conflict he had experienced with Jim Dickson, the group's original manager, in 1965. Melcher's return to the producer's chair began an association with the band that would last until \"Byrdmaniax\" in 1971, much longer than his first tenure as the Byrds' producer. In early 1969, the script writer and leading actor of \"Easy Rider\", Peter Fonda, asked Bob Dylan to compose a theme song for the film. Dylan declined but as a consolation he offered the lines - \"The river flows, it flows to the sea/Wherever that river goes, that's where I want to be/Flow, river, flow\" - which he hurriedly scribbled onto a napkin, before telling Fonda to \"give that to McGuinn.\" The fragment was dutifully passed on to the Byrds' guitarist, Roger McGuinn, who added his own lyrical and musical contributions to fashion a completed song, which he titled \"Ballad of Easy Rider\". After seeing a private screening of \"Easy Rider\" and realizing that he had been named as co-writer of the film's theme song, Dylan demanded that his writing credit be removed, leading McGuinn to theorize in later years that Dylan had disliked the film's ending and anti-hero motif. In 2000 McGuinn recounted to Jud Cost the story of how Dylan disowned credit for the song: \"I got a call from Dylan at three o'clock in the morning going 'What's this? I don't want this credit. Take it off.'\" Another possible reason for Dylan insisting that his name be removed from the song's credits may have been a suspicion that his name was being exploited to boost the film's credibility. Two versions of the song \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" were released. The first was the version included on the \"Easy Rider\" soundtrack album, which was listed as a solo performance by Roger McGuinn, although it also featured fellow Byrd Gene Parsons on harmonica. The second was the recording by the Byrds, which was included on the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album and released as a single. The version of the song found on the soundtrack album and used in the film is a completely different take to the version released by the Byrds.",

Much of \"Easy Rider\"'s significance owes to the fact that it was produced for a respectable, if still modest, budget and released by a major studio. The project was first taken by one of its cocreators, Peter Fonda, to American International. Fonda had become AIP's top star in the Corman\u2013directed \"The Wild Angels\" (1966), a biker movie, and \"The Trip\", as in LSD. The idea Fonda pitched would combine those two proven themes. AIP was intrigued but balked at giving his collaborator, Dennis Hopper\u2014who had appeared in \"The Trip\" and several other AIP opuses\u2014free directorial rein. The duo then took their concept, for which they had projected a $60,000 budget, to producer Bert Schneider. Suggesting that they would have an easier time raising $600,000, Schneider helped arrange a financing and distribution deal with Columbia Pictures, where his brother was president. Two more graduates of the Corman/AIP exploitation mill joined the project: Jack Nicholson and cinematographer L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs. The film (which managed to incorporate another favorite exploitation theme, the redneck menace, as well as a fair amount of nudity) was brought in at a cost of $501,000. \"Easy Rider\" would earn $19.1 million in rentals, becoming, as one history puts it, \"the seminal film that provided the bridge between all the repressed tendencies represented by schlock/kitsch/hack since the dawn of Hollywood and the mainstream cinema of the seventies.\"",

The dramatic phenotypic change from primate to early hominin is hypothesized to have involved the extreme loss of body hair \u2013 except for areas most exposed to UV radiation, such as the head \u2013 to allow for more efficient thermoregulation in the early hunter-gatherers. The skin that would have been exposed upon general body hair loss in these early hominins would have most likely been non-pigmented, reflecting the pale skin underlying the hair of our chimpanzee relatives. A positive advantage would have been conferred to early hominids inhabiting the African continent that were capable of producing darker skin \u2013 those who first expressed the eumelanin-producing MC1R allele \u2013 which protected them from harmful epithelium-damaging ultraviolet rays. Over time, the advantage conferred to those with darker skin may have led to the prevalence of darker skin on the continent. The positive advantage, however, would have had to be strong enough so as to produce a significantly higher reproductive fitness in those who produced more melanin. The cause of a selective pressure strong enough to cause this shift is an area of much debate. Some hypotheses include the existence of significantly lower reproductive fitness in people with less melanin due to lethal skin cancer, lethal kidney disease due to excess vitamin D formation in the skin of people with less melanin, or simply natural selection due to mate preference and sexual selection.",

In comparison to carbon dioxide, methane has much greater effect on temperature as methane is around 34 times more effective per molecule than carbon dioxide on a 100-year scale (it has a higher global warming potential). Most of the methane released to the atmosphere during this period of time would have been from wetlands, swamps, and forests. The atmospheric methane concentration today is 0.000179% or 1.79 ppmv. Due to the warmer climate and sea level rise associated with the early Eocene, more wetlands, more forests, and more coal deposits would be available for methane release. Comparing the early Eocene production of methane to current levels of atmospheric methane, the early Eocene would be able to produce triple the amount of current methane production. The warm temperatures during the early Eocene could have increased methane production rates, and methane that is released into the atmosphere would in turn warm the troposphere, cool the stratosphere, and produce water vapor and carbon dioxide through oxidation. Biogenic production of methane produces carbon dioxide and water vapor along with the methane, as well as yielding infrared radiation. The breakdown of methane in an oxygen atmosphere produces carbon monoxide, water vapor and infrared radiation. The carbon monoxide is not stable so it eventually becomes carbon dioxide and in doing so releases yet more infrared radiation. Water vapor traps more infrared than does carbon dioxide.",

By the start of the Archean eon, they already covered much of the Earth. This early formation has been difficult to explain because of a problem known as the faint young Sun paradox. Stars are known to get brighter as they age, and at the time of its formation the Sun would have been emitting only 70% of its current power. Thus, the Sun has become 30% brighter in the last 4.5 billion years. Many models indicate that the Earth would have been covered in ice. A likely solution is that there was enough carbon dioxide and methane to produce a greenhouse effect. The carbon dioxide would have been produced by volcanoes and the methane by early microbes. Another greenhouse gas, ammonia, would have been ejected by volcanos but quickly destroyed by ultraviolet radiation.",

If it were possible to wind an appropriate coil using YBCO tape then, assuming an I of 70 A and a thickness of 100 \u03bcm, we would have 100 turns and 7 000 A turns. This would produce a B field of approximately 7 000/(20 \u00d7 10) \u00d7 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10 = 0.4 T. To produce 10 T would require pulsing to 1 400 A! An alternative calculation would be to assume a J of say 5 \u00d7 10Am and a coil 1\u00a0cm in cross section. The field would then be 5 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10) = 10 T. Clearly if the magnetisation fixture is not to occupy more room than the puck itself then a very high activation current would be required and either constraint makes in situ magnetization a very difficult proposition. What is required for in situ magnetisation is a magnetisation method in which a relatively small field of the order of milliteslas repeatedly applied is used to magnetize the superconductor.",

During late 2014 and early 2015, the band moved recording and production over to Montreal, Quebec, at the Golden Ratio Studios, where they worked with Canadian music producer Damian Taylor, who had previously worked with American rock band The Killers on their 2011 album \"Battle Born\", and as a creative companion to Icelandic musician Bj\u00f6rk. An initial version of the album with 13 tracks was tracked at the end of April 2015, however, the creative process continued when additional songs were written and recorded for the album. Numerous delays pushed the recording and production of the album well into 2015, despite an open declaration early in that year, by Mandagi, that the album would be soon completed. By then, the band had collaborated with European producer Pascal Gabriel, co-writer and producer of various Marina and the Diamonds and Goldfrapp tracks, British songwriter and producer Justin Parker, known for his work with American recording artist Lana Del Rey, and American producer Ben H. Allen, who had previously produced albums for art rock acts Animal Collective and Deerhunter. Ultimately, in October 2015, 32 months after the band started production, amassing over 40 song ideas in the process, the album's production entered the audio mixing phase. Mandagi expressed dissatisfaction with the album's lengthy recording process, though insisted that he and the band were, in contrast, satisfied with the outcome and the final product, stating, \"sometimes it was ok, sometimes it was a bit trying but you know nothing good comes easy we just had to keep at it. We didn't put it out until it was right, 'til we felt right.\"",

In addition, the quartet liked what the producers had written and said \"No, stop! What was that? Play that again!\" At the time, Neon Jungle were to depart to Los Angeles the next day and it was the last time the group had left to record with their producers. On the day, at 01:00, the group insisted on recording the song and did so through the early hours of the morning. In an interview with VanityHype Magazine, Neon Jungle mentioned, \"While we were doing it we were vibing off it and we had our own words and stuff, so it was just like a vibey night, ha ha!\" \"Welcome to the Jungle\" was initially planned to be released as the group's second single but was put on-hold in favour of \"Braveheart\". Speaking to Beverley Lyons of the \"Daily Record\", group member Shereen Cutkelvin mentioned, \"We didn't even know the title at first so that wasn't the reason we went for it. As soon as we heard the beat, we just knew it was the one.\" She also stated that if the group never \"randomly found\" the song, it would have never been recorded and deemed it her favourite song on their debut album, \"Welcome to the Jungle\" (2014).

The beat was killer, it was calling us so we released it as our second single instead [of 'Welcome to the Jungle']\".
