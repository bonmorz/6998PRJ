Red kangaroos are mostly crepuscular and nocturnal, resting in the shade during the day. However, they sometimes move about during the day. Red kangaroos rely on small saltbushes or mulga bushes for shelter in extreme heat rather than rocky outcrops or caves. Grazing takes up most of their daily activities. Like most kangaroo species, they are mostly sedentary, staying within a relatively well-defined home range. However, great environmental changes can cause them to travel great distances. Kangaroos in New South Wales have weekly home ranges of 258\u2013560 ha, with the larger areas belonging to adult males. When forage is poor and rainfall patchy, kangaroos will travel 25\u201330\u00a0km to more favourable feeding grounds. Another study of kangaroos in central Australia found that most of them stay close to remaining vegetation but disperse to find fresh plants after it rains. The red kangaroo is too big to be subject to significant non-human predation. They can use their robust legs and clawed feet to defend themselves from attackers with kicks and blows. However, dingoes and eagles will kill and eat joeys. Joeys are thus protected in their mother's pouch. The red kangaroo formerly did have major predators that are now extinct. Extinct predators included the marsupial lion, Megalania, and the wonambi. Kangaroos are adept swimmers, and often flee into waterways if threatened by a predator. If pursued into the water, a kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it.",

A young tree kangaroo is referred to as a joey as is the case with all kangaroos. The gestation period for this extract species is currently unknown, however, other tree kangaroos have a period of approximately 30 days therefore, a similar period is expect for the tenkile. Parental care is carried out by the females though the exact involvement of the males is unknown. Groups of a male, female, and young have been observed but so have groups of only female and young. Newborns are carried in the mother pouch until they are old enough to leave this can last up to a year. After being born the young will spend two years with its mother before becoming independent.",

Wotjobaluk hunters told Adolf Hartmann that kangaroos had acute hearing, and could twig the presence of a predator at 150\u00a0yards simply by hearing the noise of ankle-bones cracking. Older kangaroos were apt to cast their young from their marsupial pouch if chased by dingos, to distract the dogs from their main prey.",

Dum lives with Ma and Pa Skillet, in the Okefenokee swamp of southern Georgia. Whenever Doo and Dum greet each other, Scooby-Doo yells, \"Scooby, Dooby, Dooby, Dum\" and Scooby-Dum says, \"Scooby, doobie, doo.\" They then do a special handshake involving two high fives. Whenever he hears the word \"Clue\", Scooby-Dum invariably pulls out a magnifying glass and, intoning the opening four notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, chants, \"Dum, dum, dum, DUM!\", even after a mystery is solved. The inclusion of Scooby-Dum is considered one of the first missteps in Scooby-Doo cartoons.",

After escaping from custody, Hibbs then spent a sizable amount of his trust fund to purchase a suit of armor from the \"Sharper Villain Catalogue.\" The kangaroo-themed armor enhanced his strength and leaping ability, as well as provided him with a semi-prehensile tail and a pouch-level cannon. Once again bounding through the streets of New York, Hibbs was again confronted by Spider-Man. After recovering from a blow by the superhero, the Kangaroo then unveiled his pouch cannon; Spider-Man hastily webbed the cannon shut, preventing it from firing. Hibbs nonetheless fired his pouch cannon, without first considering the consequences of his action. The pouch cannon exploded in his crotch region, rendering him unconscious, while Spider-Man webbed him upside-down from a streetlamp.",

In August 2004, Matthew Lillard said in an interview that the third \"Scooby-Doo\" film was cancelled. \"There will be no \"Scooby 3\",\" Lillard said. \"The second one didn't do as well as it was expected to do, and I completely hold that to Warner Brothers' fault. I think Warner Brothers made a mistake releasing it at the time they did March 2004. I think the movie's much better than the first movie, and I honestly thought it was going to do ridiculously good box office. But we had a bad timeslot. We had 13 movies open up in two weeks after we opened up.

Surviving evidence suggests that it was a relatively shy, nocturnal creature with the general appearance of a medium-to-large-size dog, except for its stiff tail and abdominal pouch (reminiscent of kangaroo) and dark transverse stripes that radiated from the top of its back, similar to those of a tiger. The thylacine was an apex predator, like the tigers and wolves of the Northern Hemisphere from which it obtained two of its common names. As a marsupial, it was not closely related to these placental mammals, but because of convergent evolution it displayed the same general form and adaptations. Its closest living relative is thought to be either the Tasmanian devil or the numbat. The thylacine was one of only two marsupials to have a pouch in both sexes (the other being the water opossum). The male thylacine had a pouch that acted as a protective sheath, covering his external reproductive organs while he ran through thick brush. The thylacine has been described as a formidable predator because of its ability to survive and hunt prey in extremely sparsely populated areas.",
