During the Jeopardy! round, except in response to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling. If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity. If, after a game is over, a ruling change is made that would have significantly altered the outcome of the game, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show.",

The host is now changed to Najip Ali (who also hosted the Malay edition \"Kita Orang Singapura\") and the questions are now focused on global trends and current affairs, hence the title \"Global Edition\". The round had six questions that focused on the statistics and surveys asked by Singaporeans, which are narrated by the celebrity icon. The contestant starting from the left podium, will get to choose one of the six celebrity icons to ask them a survey-related multiple-choice question of three answers. Every correct answer is worth $200. In replacement with the Hero or Zero card, which was removed for the entire season, an incorrect answer will result in a 'Kena Fine', which deducts the contestant's winnings from $1 up to $100, with a penalty of up to $261 (the denominations were $1, $10, $20, $50, $80 and $100; the winnings cannot go below $0 or end with negative score). The next contestant will have to answer from the remaining two options; a correct answer will earn $100, but an incorrect answer will also deduct by the same denomination. This made for a maximum possible winnings of $900.",

A notable quote is when the midget patriarch says \"remember there is no sex in our country.\" The phrase is a quotation of a famous episode from the \"perestroika\"-era TV show \"US-Soviet Space Bridge\" hosted by Vladimir Pozner when an American asked a question about TV advertisements exploiting sex in the Soviet Union, and a Soviet lady (, Liudmila Ivanova) proudly answered \"There is no sex in the USSR!\". In fact, she said \"Well, sex... (laugh) we don't have it, and we are absolutely against it!\", which was then corrected by another soviet lady present in the show: \"We do have sex, but we do not have advertisements!\".",

While decoding The Abstract, Chase discovered Victor's last and most potent weakness: three questions designed specifically to overload Victor's circuits and lock him into a never ending loop of meaningless binary, which Nico refers to as \"the blue screen of death.\" Chase used the first phrase against Victor after the cyborg discovered Nico in chains: \"Could God make a sandwich so big that even He couldn't finish it?\" The only way for Victor to recover from his shutdown mode is by hearing the question's answer from someone else. Once Victor's mainframe becomes functional again, he cannot be affected by that specific phrase ever again. The two other phrases are unrevealed as yet, and are known only to Chase and Nico.",
