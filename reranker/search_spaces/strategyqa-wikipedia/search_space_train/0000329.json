Type two herpes is known as herpes on the genitals which is spread through sexual contact. These lesions come from skin to skin contact or body secretions. The skin starts to develop blisters which can happen anywhere on the body. To return to any activity one must be cleared by a doctor. Herpes Simplex is the virus that causes cold sores this virus can be spread by oral seceretions and can also cause Herpes Gladiatorial. Once a person becomes infected the virus stays in the body forever and can reactivate itself anytime causing cold sores. Herpes Gladiatorial is a skin infection. it comes from the Herpes Simplex virus which is causes the same lesion one has when they have a cold sore. This form of herpes is on the skin and can be spread through contact with others or sharing beverages with someone who is infected or using anything that they may have contaminated. This virus remains in your system and can reactivate itself at any time causing lesions to appear. Herpes Zoster is the virus which causes shingles and chicken pox. Once one has had the chicken pox they carry the virus forever. Once one has chicken pox the virus is inactive but, if it becomes active again they get the shingles.",

Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms but can be confirmed with specific testing. Prevention includes avoiding kissing or using the personal items of a person who is infected.

Nevertheless, the documentation of patient and caregiver is confidential meaning that medical records will not be disclosed unless consent is given or there is a belief that disclosing records is crucial. Furthermore, generally, health care providers do not disclose information unless they meet a standard that falls above the required FERPA health or safety exception, or consent is given, and thus is limited in providing information within the constraints of the confidentiality among patient and provider.",

For example, health providers such as counselors, also have the obligation to be confidential and not disclose private information. However, as medical providers move towards integrated care, such that mental and physical records are shared amongst themselves, there arises a confidentiality challenge that may lead to college students to fall behind in school. Since confidentiality is compromised as information is disclosed among providers that use this method of continuity care, less students utilize therapy because they refuse to disclose private information that can then be shared with others. This simultaneously fuels the stigma towards college counseling. Thus, as more information becomes disclosed, less college students seek counseling due to lack of confidentiality as medical records of patients are disclosed between medical providers, when legally the obligation of these medical providers is to abide and guarantee privacy and confidentiality by withholding patient's information unless under specific circumstances.",

Planned Parenthood countered that, before the license could be finalized, the abortion facility would have to be subjected to an unannounced inspection, requiring that abortions were already being performed there.
