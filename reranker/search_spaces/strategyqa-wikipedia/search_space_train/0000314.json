Heap has performed the song in live performances, which she invites the audience to participate on it. \"Just for Now\" was covered by American recording artist Kelly Clarkson, for her sixth studio album \"Wrapped in Red\" (2013).

The song was also sampled in Clams Casino's composition \"I'm God\", featured on both \"Instrumentals\" and Lil B's \"6 kiss\", and was covered by Pentatonix on their 2015 deluxe edition of their Christmas album \"That's Christmas to Me\".",
