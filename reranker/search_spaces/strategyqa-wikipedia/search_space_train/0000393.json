This armadillo is found to have eighteen dorsal bands, in which eight are considered movable. The Andean Hairy Armadillo gets its name genuinely because this armadillo has hair covering all of its ventral side and its legs as well. This species comes in a variety of colors ranging from light brown to yellow/beige. Their teeth are unique because they are continuously growing and do not contain enamel. Their average weight tends to be four in a half to five pounds. They maintain an internal temperature and use limb Countercurrent exchange as well.",

            "document": "Blakiston's fish owl . Blakiston's fish owl is the largest living species of owl. A pair field study of the species showed males weighing from , while the female, at up to , is about 25% larger. Around February, the average weight of Russian fish owls was in males and in females, typically when their body mass at its lowest throughout the year. Blakiston's fish owl measures in total length, and thus measures slightly less at average and maximum length than the great gray owl (\"Strix nebulosa\"), a species which has a significantly lower body mass. The Eurasian eagle-owl (\"B. bubo\") is sometimes considered the largest overall living owl species. The three largest races of eagle-owl, all found in Siberia and the Russian Far East, are close in size to the Blakiston's fish owl. According to Heimo Mikkola, the very largest specimen of eagle-owl was longer in bill-to-tail length than the longest Blakiston's fish owl, while the top weight of the two species is exactly the same. The longest great gray owl was longer than the biggest Blakiston's fish owl but would be about 2.5 times lighter than the weight of the largest female Blakiston's. However, the average measurements of Blakiston's fish owl surpass the average measurements of the Eurasian eagle-owl in the three major categories: weight, length, and wingspan, making Blakiston's the overall largest species of owl. Even the large Siberian races of eagle-owl are slightly smaller on average than the Blakiston's, at least in terms of body mass and wing size. The maximum wingspan of the Blakiston's fish owl is also greater than any known eagle-owl. The wingspan range known for Blakiston's fish owls is . It is possible the largest specimens can attain a wingspan of approximately . The Blakiston's is noticeably larger than the other three extant species of fish owl.",

The six-banded armadillo is the largest in Euphractinae, which also contains the pichi and hairy armadillos; in fact, it is the third largest armadillo after the giant armadillo and the greater long-nosed armadillo. This armadillo is typically between in head-and-body length, and weighs . The carapace is pale yellow to reddish brown (though not a dark shade of brown or black), marked by scales of equal length, and scantily covered by buff to white bristle-like hairs \u2013 unlike the hairy armadillos, that are covered by dense hairs. The shell narrows to 70 to 80 percent of its original width towards the top of the head, which is covered by plates arranged in a definite pattern. The forefeet have five distinct toes, each with moderately developed claws, of which the third is the longest.",
