The play was a sold out success, winning the young director the Tesla Award. It starred James Lee Taylor as Nikola Tesla, one of the most respected Serbian-American scientists in the world. The play will soon be moving to London\u2019s West End. Furthermore, Sanja's goal is to take this story a step further in 2014 by directing a documentary movie about the mysterious life of Nikola Tesla. These projects are highly supported by The Tesla Science Foundation and Office for Cooperation with Diaspora and Serbs in the Region.  Nikola Tesla is finally beginning to attract real attention and encourage serious debate nearly 70 years after his death. Nikola Tesla, Serbian-American scientist, the man who lit the world, gave his greatest contribution to science and technological progress of the world as the inventor of the rotating magnetic field and of the complete system of production and distribution of electrical energy (motors, generators) based on the use of alternate currents. His name was given to the SI unit for magnetic induction (\"tesla\"). Tesla also constructed the generators of high-frequency alternate currents and high-voltage coreless transformer known today as \"Tesla Coil\". Sanja has managed to bring to life moments of Tesla's life that the public had yet to see and displayed important moments and sequences of Tesla's life, which for mysterious reasons have remained a well kept secret to date. Tesla whom we might have referred to as holy, sacred, died before he was recognized as someone who truly marked the history of mankind. Sanja's play was supported by the Office for Cooperation with Diaspora and Serbs in the Region, Consulate General of the Republic of Serbia in New York, Vuk Jeremi\u0107 - Serbian physicist, politician and President of the 67th session of United Nations General Assembly, the Tesla Science Foundation, the Nikola Tesla Club, and the Nikola Tesla Inventors Club in the US.",

She began school in Sarajevo in 1879, one year after the Bosnia Eyalet was occupied by the Austro-Hungarian Empire, at the only school for girls available in Bosnia, founded by Paulina Irby. She finished four years of elementary education by 1886 and had trained as a teacher. That same year, she married Nikola Ka\u0161ikovi\u0107, a teacher at Miss Irby's school. Together, they had three sons and a daughter. She herself taught at Miss Irby's school in the latter part of the first decade of the 1900s. During World War I, the Austro-Hungarian government convicted Stoja, Nikola and one of their sons of treason in 1917\u201318, but the convictions were negated when the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed later in 1918 and Bosnia became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia). Nothing is known of her life after the war other than she began receiving a pension after her husband's death in 1927.",

The Central-European school became the avant-garde in football, and coaches from territories that was once Austro-Hungary were highly regarded throughout the globe. At the end of First World War, the Austro-Hungarian Empire dissolved, and the successor countries continued the tradition of its football school. Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland and Romania became the core that would compete against the few other football powerhouses. Prior WWII it was common to see Austrian and Hungarian coaches in all European top clubs, plus players, added by Czechoslovaks and Yugoslavs. In clubs of all these Central-European leagues, it was common to see coaches and players from other parts of Europe. However, when communists came to power, this practice was discontinued, and clubs were forced to develop their schools and focus on domestic players only.
