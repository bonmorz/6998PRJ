Other \"retiarius\" tricks were to whip the net at his opponent's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him. The helmet of the \"secutor\" was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net. In most cases, the \"secutor\" knew to expect the net-man's tactics and tried to intercept and hold on to the weapon, possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net. In such danger, the \"retiarius\" could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger. The \"secutor\" stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it. Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the \"retiarius\" used his net. Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net, yet the class is named for the device, and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a \"retiarius\" in his satires. The discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance, and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict. The lack of nets in \"retiarius\" images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility is that some \"retiarii\" simply did not use nets. In most bouts, the \"retiarius\" probably had to resort to fighting with just his trident and dagger, placing him at a disadvantage. The trident was his primary weapon in such situations, and its length allowed the \"retiarius\" to keep his opponent at bay. He held the weapon two-handed, left nearer the prongs, so that he could parry his enemy's strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends. Wielded two-handed, the weapon could land powerful blows. Images show \"retiarii\" stabbing downward at the \"secutor\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s unshielded legs or stabbing down at the helmet in an attempt to poke through an eyehole. The trident itself was too weak to pierce the metal, although a skull found at Ephesus, Turkey, dating to CE\u00a0200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to the head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent. The \"secutor\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s helmet was rounded and free of protrusions to avoid snaring the net or being caught in the trident's prongs, but attacks on it forced the \"secutor\" to duck or hide behind his shield. This reduced his field of vision and gave the \"retiarius\" an advantage with his speed. Should the \"secutor\" strike with his sword, the \"retiarius\" parried with the trident prongs and attempted to disarm him. Likewise, the more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block the trident with his shield and force the net-man to lose it. Another type of gladiator, scissor could also be pitted against a \"retiarius\". Images from the Eastern Roman Empire show \"scissores\" wearing a tubular arm-guard in lieu of a shield. The guard fits over the left hand and ends in a hooked, knife-like blade that was probably intended to parry the net and trident or to snag and pull away the net. \"Scissores\" who succeeded in this probably dropped the hook weapon and fought with just a sword.",

A speed reload (also known as a \"combat reload\") is the action of reloading a weapon in a very short amount of time by ejecting the currently loaded magazine with one hand, and drawing as well as loading fresh magazine with the other hand. This is quite similar to a regular reload of a weapon, but when well performed can have a large time advantage. The tactical advantage here is lost with closed bolt weapons that do not have a round in the chamber, as the gun will then require cocking with the new magazine inserted to chamber the new rounds. This does not apply to open bolt weapons, as they do not require charging. A speed reload is often thought to be more or less the opposite of a tactical reload.",

According to these rules, it was forbidden to injure or kill an opponent who has lost their weapon, who surrenders, or who has been knocked unconscious. The \"Manusm\u1e5bti\" tells that if a warrior's topknot comes loose during a duel, the opponent must give him time to bind his hair before continuing. Both duellists are required to wield the same weapon, and specific rules may have existed for each weapon. For example, the \"Mahabharata\" records that hitting below the waist is forbidden in mace duels. In one ancient form of dueling, two warriors wielded a knife in the right hand while their left hands were tied together.",

The Crusaders, a playable character class new to the expansion, were formed by the cleric Akkhan in order to expose and cleanse the corruption at the heart of the Zakarum faith. Crusaders believe their mission would never end; to this end, each crusader is obliged to train an apprentice who would eventually take up their arms and their very name to preserve their legacy. The Crusaders are notably more focused on offensive abilities than Paladins or Templars, capable of both using weapon-based attacks up close and cast holy magic from a distance. The Crusaders' class-specific weapon is a flail, which comes in one-handed or two-handed versions. As many of their abilities rely on having a shield equipped, they are the only class that may opt to wield a two-handed weapon in one hand while using a shield in the other.",

The player's effectiveness in combat relies on the use of weapons and armor (which may be bought, found or forged) and on the use of magic spells which may be bought or unlocked by finding spell tomes. Weapons and magic are assigned to each hand allowing for dual-wielding and can be swapped out through a quick-access menu of favorite items. Some weapons and master spells require both hands. Shields can be used to fend off enemy attacks and reduce incurred damage or offensively through bashing attacks. Blunt, bladed, and hacking weapons can be used in close combat and each have specific advantages and roles. For example, the player can perform power attacks with each weapon. Spells have several functions such as regenerating the player's health, attacking enemies, confusing people or creatures, temporarily raising the dead, casting light or turning iron into silver. A bow and arrow may be utilized in long-range combat, but the bow can also be used as a defensive melee weapon in close combat by \"bashing\". The player can enter sneak mode and pickpocket or deliver powerful sneak attacks to unsuspecting enemies.",
