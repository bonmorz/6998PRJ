As the number approaches 21 million, mining rewards will approach zero, and Bitcoin output with cease once and for all. The transactions demand for Bitcoins will, in contrast, tend to go on increasing with economic growth. A Bitcoin standard would thus tend to result in a rate of deflation at least equal to the rate of economic growth, with occasional bouts of more severe deflation occurring with every cyclical increase in the demand for money. Although (as I\u2019ve argued elsewhere) deflation needn\u2019t go hand-in-hand with recession or depression so long as the rate of deflation reflects an economy\u2019s (total factor) productivity growth rate, chances are that deflation in a Bitcoin economy would frequently exceed this safe limit.Because bitcoin's supply was predetermined at inception and considered unchangeable it cannot fluctuate with the demand cycles and thus Selgin suggests it cannot be made very stable in regard to its purchasing power. However, this still leaves the possibility that bitcoin fits Nash's concept of \"Asymptotically Ideal Money\". Whether Nash was specifically referring to bitcoin or not it still might have the same effect and lead to the intended result of international stability of the existing legacy fiat currencies (and possibly in relation to bitcoin).",

George Selgin, an expert on free banking theory, expounds on value proposition of bitcoin in regard to the inability to control its supply (ie inflation targeting):It doesn\u2019t follow, however, that either Bitcoins\u2019 purchasing power or the volume of Bitcoin-denominated payments will be stable enough to make Bitcoins anyone\u2019s idea of a sound money. Because it makes no allowances for changes in the real demand for Bitcoins, whatever their source, the strict \u201cprotocol\u201d that regulates the supply of Bitcoins\u2014a protocol that raises Bitcoin \u201cmining\u201d costs in response to changes in mining activity and technology, but without regard to Bitcoins\u2019 purchasing power\u2014would allow fluctuations in the pure transactions demand for Bitcoins to continue to influence their purchasing power. As the number approaches 21 million, mining rewards will approach zero, and Bitcoin output with cease once and for all. The transactions demand for Bitcoins will, in contrast, tend to go on increasing with economic growth. A Bitcoin standard would thus tend to result in a rate of deflation at least equal to the rate of economic growth, with occasional bouts of more severe deflation occurring with every cyclical increase in the demand for money. Although (as I\u2019ve argued elsewhere) deflation needn\u2019t go hand-in-hand with recession or depression so long as the rate of deflation reflects an economy\u2019s (total factor) productivity growth rate, chances are that deflation in a Bitcoin economy would frequently exceed this safe limit.Because bitcoin's supply was predetermined at inception and considered unchangeable it cannot fluctuate with the demand cycles and thus Selgin suggests it cannot be made very stable in regard to its purchasing power. However, this still leaves the possibility that bitcoin fits Nash's concept of \"Asymptotically Ideal Money\". Whether Nash was specifically referring to bitcoin or not it still might have the same effect and lead to the intended result of international stability of the existing legacy fiat currencies (and possibly in relation to bitcoin).",

Coupon payments and bond redemption are also executed by algorithm, eliminating the need for brokerages and theoretically reducing bond duration to zero, making credit ratings obsolete. Investors choose bond size and bond maturity of seven days to 10 years. Payments are emitted from the block chain to the SwiftCoin wallet chosen by the investor at the time of bond creation. There are no commissions or fees to pay. The only requirement to purchase a Solidus Bond is a SwiftCoin wallet and a sufficient balance of the SwiftCoin digital currency to cover the face value of the bond. Bond ownership is conveyed solely through possession. There are no accounts, records, or user databases and the block chain ledger is not public. Interest rates are set by the market and were 18% in 2016. Holders of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies convert to SwiftCoin to access the Solidus Bond block chain, then cash back into their initial currency at bond expiry. Solidus Bonds are not open source. Unlike Bitcoin, Solidus Bonds cannot be mined.",
