Ballad of Easy Rider is the eighth album by the American rock band the Byrds and was released in November 1969 on Columbia Records (\"see\" 1969 in music). The album was named after the song \"Ballad of Easy Rider\", which had been written by the Byrds' guitarist and singer, Roger McGuinn (with help from Bob Dylan), as the theme song for the 1969 film, \"Easy Rider\". The title was also chosen in an attempt to capitalize on the commercial success of the film, although the majority of the music on the album had no connection with it. Nonetheless, the association with \"Easy Rider\" heightened the Byrds' public profile and resulted in \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" becoming the band's highest charting album for two years in the U.S.",

Recording sessions for \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" were produced by Terry Melcher, who had also worked as the Byrds' producer during 1965, on their \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" albums. The band decided to work with Melcher again as a result of their dissatisfaction with Bob Johnston's production on their previous album, \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\", and on their recent single, \"Lay Lady Lay\". Melcher was happy to accept the band's invitation to produce the album but his one stipulation was that he would also take on management duties for the Byrds, not wishing for a repeat of the conflict he had experienced with Jim Dickson, the group's original manager, in 1965. Melcher's return to the producer's chair began an association with the band that would last until \"Byrdmaniax\" in 1971, much longer than his first tenure as the Byrds' producer. In early 1969, the script writer and leading actor of \"Easy Rider\", Peter Fonda, asked Bob Dylan to compose a theme song for the film. Dylan declined but as a consolation he offered the lines - \"The river flows, it flows to the sea/Wherever that river goes, that's where I want to be/Flow, river, flow\" - which he hurriedly scribbled onto a napkin, before telling Fonda to \"give that to McGuinn.\" The fragment was dutifully passed on to the Byrds' guitarist, Roger McGuinn, who added his own lyrical and musical contributions to fashion a completed song, which he titled \"Ballad of Easy Rider\". After seeing a private screening of \"Easy Rider\" and realizing that he had been named as co-writer of the film's theme song, Dylan demanded that his writing credit be removed, leading McGuinn to theorize in later years that Dylan had disliked the film's ending and anti-hero motif. In 2000 McGuinn recounted to Jud Cost the story of how Dylan disowned credit for the song: \"I got a call from Dylan at three o'clock in the morning going 'What's this? I don't want this credit. Take it off.'\" Another possible reason for Dylan insisting that his name be removed from the song's credits may have been a suspicion that his name was being exploited to boost the film's credibility. Two versions of the song \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" were released. The first was the version included on the \"Easy Rider\" soundtrack album, which was listed as a solo performance by Roger McGuinn, although it also featured fellow Byrd Gene Parsons on harmonica. The second was the recording by the Byrds, which was included on the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album and released as a single. The version of the song found on the soundtrack album and used in the film is a completely different take to the version released by the Byrds.",

Musically the album consolidated and streamlined the band's country rock sound, consisting mostly of cover versions and traditional material, with three self-penned original songs. The first single to be released from the album was the title track, issued in October 1969 in America and reaching number 65 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. Composed primarily by McGuinn, with some input from Bob Dylan (although not credited), \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" was written as the theme tune for the 1969 countercultural film \"Easy Rider\". However the Byrds' recording of the song does not appear in the film, instead an acoustic version credited to McGuinn alone was used. However the Byrds' song \"Wasn't Born to Follow\" from \"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\" album was featured in \"Easy Rider\" and also included on the \"Easy Rider\" soundtrack album in August 1969. The Byrds' association with the film heightened their public profile and when the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album was released in November 1969, it peaked at number 36 in the U.S. and number 41 in the UK, becoming the band's highest charting album for two years in America. A second single taken from the album, \"Jesus Is Just Alright\", was released in December 1969 but it only managed to reach number 97. Despite this lack of commercial success, the Doobie Brothers' later hit version of \"Jesus Is Just Alright\" features an arrangement that was heavily influenced by the Byrds' recording. Just prior to the release of \"Ballad of Easy Rider\", the Byrds underwent yet another change in personnel when bassist John York was asked to leave the band in September 1969. York had become disenchanted with his role in the Byrds and had voiced his reluctance to perform material that had been written and recorded by the group before he had joined. The rest of the band had begun to doubt his commitment and so, a consensus was reached among the other three members that York should be fired. He was replaced, at the suggestion of Parsons and White, by Skip Battin, a freelance session musician and one-time member of the duo Skip & Flip. Battin's recruitment marked the last personnel change to the group for almost three years and as a result, the McGuinn\u2013White\u2013Parsons\u2013Battin line-up became the most stable and longest-lived of any configuration of the Byrds.",

Upon its release, the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album revived the Byrds' commercial fortunes, giving the band their first U.S. Top 40 album since \"Younger Than Yesterday\" in 1967. This renewed success was, in part, due to the band's public profile having been increased as a result of their involvement with \"Easy Rider\" and the inclusion of three Byrds-related songs on the film's soundtrack album. Columbia Records' was eager to capitalize on this new-found popularity and launched an advertising campaign for the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album, proclaiming \"The movie gave you the facts, the Ballad interprets them.\" However, with the exception of the title track, none of the songs on the album had much to do with the film.

Recording sessions for \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" were produced by Terry Melcher, who had also worked as the Byrds' producer during 1965, on their \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" albums. The band decided to work with Melcher again as a result of their dissatisfaction with Bob Johnston's production on their previous album, \"Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\", and on their recent single, \"Lay Lady Lay\". Melcher was happy to accept the band's invitation to produce the album but his one stipulation was that he would also take on management duties for the Byrds, not wishing for a repeat of the conflict he had experienced with Jim Dickson, the group's original manager, in 1965. Melcher's return to the producer's chair began an association with the band that would last until \"Byrdmaniax\" in 1971, much longer than his first tenure as the Byrds' producer. In early 1969, the script writer and leading actor of \"Easy Rider\", Peter Fonda, asked Bob Dylan to compose a theme song for the film. Dylan declined but as a consolation he offered the lines - \"The river flows, it flows to the sea/Wherever that river goes, that's where I want to be/Flow, river, flow\" - which he hurriedly scribbled onto a napkin, before telling Fonda to \"give that to McGuinn.\" The fragment was dutifully passed on to the Byrds' guitarist, Roger McGuinn, who added his own lyrical and musical contributions to fashion a completed song, which he titled \"Ballad of Easy Rider\". After seeing a private screening of \"Easy Rider\" and realizing that he had been named as co-writer of the film's theme song, Dylan demanded that his writing credit be removed, leading McGuinn to theorize in later years that Dylan had disliked the film's ending and anti-hero motif. In 2000 McGuinn recounted to Jud Cost the story of how Dylan disowned credit for the song: \"I got a call from Dylan at three o'clock in the morning going 'What's this? I don't want this credit. Take it off.'\" Another possible reason for Dylan insisting that his name be removed from the song's credits may have been a suspicion that his name was being exploited to boost the film's credibility. Two versions of the song \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" were released. The first was the version included on the \"Easy Rider\" soundtrack album, which was listed as a solo performance by Roger McGuinn, although it also featured fellow Byrd Gene Parsons on harmonica. The second was the recording by the Byrds, which was included on the \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" album and released as a single. The version of the song found on the soundtrack album and used in the film is a completely different take to the version released by the Byrds.",

The film was mostly shot without a screenplay, with ad-libbed lines, and production started with only the outline and the names of the protagonists. Keeping the Western theme, Wyatt was named after Wyatt Earp and Billy after Billy the Kid. However, Southern disputed that Hopper wrote much of the script. In an interview published in 2016 [Southern died in 1995] he said, \"You know if Den Hopper improvises a dozen lines and six of them survive the cutting room floor he'll put in for screenplay credit. Now it would be almost impossible to exaggerate his contribution to the film\u2014but, by George, he manages to do it every time.\" According to Southern, Fonda was under contract to produce a motorcycle film with A.I.P., which Fonda had agreed to allow Hopper to direct.

Journalist Ann Hornaday wrote: \"With its portrait of counterculture heroes raising their middle fingers to the uptight middle-class hypocrisies, \"Easy Rider\" became the cinematic symbol of the 1960s, a celluloid anthem to freedom, macho bravado and anti-establishment rebellion\".

Although it brought Hopper and Fonda great financial and artistic rewards and helped to open up the Hollywood 'system' for young independent producers, little of the profit was shared with Southern, and the true extent of his contributions was repeatedly downplayed by the other principals.",
