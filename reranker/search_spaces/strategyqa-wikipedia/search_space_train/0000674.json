Shem replied that they had a difficult time in the Ark. During the day they fed the animals that usually fed by day, and during the night they fed those that normally fed by night. But Noah did not know what the chameleon ate. One day Noah was cutting a pomegranate, when a worm dropped out of it, and the chameleon ate it. From then on, Noah mashed up bran for the chameleon, and when the bran became wormy, the chameleon would eat. A fever struck the lion, so it lived off of its reserves rather than eating other animals. Noah discovered the \"avarshinah\" bird (some say the phoenix bird) lying in the hold of the Ark and asked it if it needed food. The bird told Noah that it saw that Noah was busy and decided not to give him any more trouble. Noah replied by asking that it be God's will that the bird not perish, as says, \"Then I said: 'I shall die with my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the phoenix.'\" A Midrash recounted that Noah fed and provided for the Ark's inhabitants for all of 12 months. But Rav Huna said in Rabbi Liezer's name that when Noah was leaving the Ark, a lion nonetheless set on him and maimed him, so that he was not fit to offer sacrifices, and his son Shem sacrificed in his stead. The Midrash took this as an application of the words of \"the righteous shall be requited on earth; how much more the wicked and the sinner.\" From this, the Midrash inferred that if in spite of his comparative righteousness, Noah was punished for his sins, \"how much more\" was the generation of the Flood. Rav Huna cited the report in that Noah offered burnt offerings from every clean animal and bird to support the proposition in a Baraita that all animals were eligible to be offered, as the words \"animal\" (, \"behemah\") and \"bird\" (, \"of\") refer to any animal or bird, and the term \"animal\" (, \"behemah\") includes wild beasts (, \"hayyah\"). Rabbi Haninah cited the report of that \"the Lord smelled the sweet savor; and\u00a0... said\u00a0...

Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba explained that God was thus telling Noah that though he may have built the Ark, but for God's covenant, Noah could not have entered the Ark. Thus Noah's ability to enter the Ark at all was proof of the covenant God established with Noah in",

Although Shem is unanimously declared by the Rabbis to have been the youngest son of Noah, he is always named first, being the most important of the three brothers. He was the ancestor of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; he was also a priest, a prophet, and one of the eight righteous mentioned twice in Genesis xi 10; they were allotted a portion both in this world and in the world to come. Shem is styled \"the great one\" According to Genesis R. xxx. 6, it was Shem who offered the sacrifices on the altar after Noah came out of the ark, because Noah, having been crippled by a lion, was unfit for the priestly office. Noah gave the priestly garments, which he had inherited from Adam, to Shem. Shem is extolled by the Rabbis for his filial devotion in covering his father's nakedness. Although his brother Japheth helped in this act, Shem suggested and began it; his brother did not arrive on the scene until Shem was already on his way with the garment. Noah, in blessing these two sons said, \"blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem\", giving special significance to Shem because Shem would be the forefather of the Jewish people.",

Lot is also now a villain, as he kills another man for his shoes, and reveals that he used to have faith in God after He sent down the fire and brimstone to Sodom and Gomorrah, but his faith didn't bring him any money, and so he turned to the false gods of the other pagan cultures. One of the sons finds Miriam crying because her daughter Esther has been kidnapped by three priests of Mole, the rain god, and will be offered as a sacrifice to Mole in the temple of the god. When Noah is notified by his sons, he warns the people in the temple, who are cheerfully waiting for Esther to be sacrificed, that they will suffer a worse punishment than the people of Sodom did, and God rips the roof of the temple off and sends thunder and snakes into the building, while striking the three priests with dumbness, blindness and deafness. God later reveals his plan to flood the world as well, and tells Noah to build an ark. The animals going to the ark pass through the village, which makes the villagers angry. The day the world floods, the angry villagers gather in front of the ark and mock him. When the rain starts, the villagers start to celebrate as it had not rained in years, but Noah and his family quickly board the ark with all the animals. As the world starts to flood with all of their citizens drowning, Esther is instructed to come without Miriam though she resists doing so at first, and all of Noah's family is thus safe.",

Rabbi Samuel bar Nahman said in Rabbi Jonathan's name that the command means of those animals with which no sin had been committed (that is, animals that had not mated with other species). The Gemara asked how Noah would know. Rav Hisda taught that Noah led them past the Ark, and those that the Ark accepted had certainly not been the object of sin, while those that the Ark rejected had certainly been the object of sin. And Rabbi Abbahu taught that Noah took only those animals (fulfilling that condition) that came of their own accord. Similarly, Rav Hisda asked how Noah knew (before the giving of ) which animals were clean and which were unclean. Rav Hisda explained that Noah led them past the Ark, and those that the Ark accepted (in multiples of seven) were certainly clean, and those that the Ark rejected were certainly unclean. Rabbi Abbahu cited \"And they that went in, went in male and female,\" to show that they went in of their own accord (in their respective pairs, seven of the clean and two of the unclean). Reading in the command to take into the Ark \"of the fowl also of the air, seven each,\" a Midrash hypothesized that the command might have meant seven of each kind of animal (three of one gender and four of the other). But then one of them would lack a mate. Hence the Midrash concluded that God meant seven males and seven females. Of course God did not need them, but they were to come (in the words of ) \"to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.\"",
