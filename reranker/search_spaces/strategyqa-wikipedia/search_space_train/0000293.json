            "document": "P. G. Wodehouse . Wodehouse's early career as a lyricist and playwright was profitable, and his work with Bolton, according to \"The Guardian\", \"was one of the most successful in the history of musical comedy\". At the outbreak of the Second World War he was earning \u00a340,000 a year from his work, which had broadened to include novels and short stories. Following the furore ensuing from the wartime broadcasts, he suffered a downturn in his popularity and book sales; \"The Saturday Evening Post\" stopped publishing his short stories, a stance they reversed in 1965, although his popularity\u2014and the sales figures\u2014slowly recovered over time. Wodehouse received great praise from many of his contemporaries, including Max Beerbohm, Rudyard Kipling, A.E. Housman and Evelyn Waugh\u2014the last of whom opines: \"One has to regard a man as a Master who can produce on average three uniquely brilliant and entirely original similes on each page.\" There are dissenters to the praise. The writer Alan Bennett thinks that \"inspired though his language is, I can never take more than ten pages of the novels at a time, their relentless flippancy wearing and tedious\", while the literary critic F. R. Leavis writes that Wodehouse had a \"stereotyped humour\u00a0... of ingenious variations on a laugh in one place\". In a 2010 study of Wodehouse's few relatively serious novels, such as \"The Coming of Bill\" (1919), \"Jill the Reckless\" (1920) and \"The Adventures of Sally\" (1922), David Heddendorf concludes that though their literary quality does not match that of the farcical novels, they show a range of empathy and interests that in real life\u2014and in his most comic works\u2014the author seemed to lack. \"Never oblivious to grief and despair, he opts in clear-eyed awareness for his timeless world of spats and woolly-headed peers. It's an austere, almost bloodless preference for pristine artifice over the pain and messy outcomes of actual existence, but it's a case of Wodehouse keeping faith with his own unique art.\"",

Wodehouse said that he based Psmith on the hotelier and impresario Rupert D'Oyly Carte\u2014\"the only thing in my literary career which was handed to me on a silver plate with watercress around it\". Wodehouse wrote in the 1970s that a cousin of his who had been at school with Carte told him of the latter's monocle, studied suavity, and stateliness of speech, all of which Wodehouse adopted for his new character. Psmith featured in three more novels: \"Psmith in the City\" (1910), a burlesque of banking; \"Psmith, Journalist\" (1915) set in New York; and \"Leave It to Psmith\" (1923), set at Blandings Castle.",

Wodehouse created new words by splitting others in two, thus Wodehouse divides \"hobnobbing\" when he writes: \"To offer a housemaid a cigarette is not hobbing.

Wodehouse believed that one of the factors that made his stories humorous was his view of life, and he stated that \"If you take life fairly easily, then you take a humorous view of things. It's probably because you were born that way.\" He carried this view through into his writing, describing the approach as \"making the thing a sort of musical comedy without music, and ignoring real life altogether\". The literary critic Edward L. Galligan considers Wodehouse's stories to show his mastery in adapting the form of the American musical comedy for his writings. Wodehouse would ensure that his first draft was as carefully and accurately done as possible, correcting and refining the prose as he wrote, and would then make another good copy, before proof reading again and then making a final copy for his publisher. Most of Wodehouse's canon is set in an undated period around the 1920s and 1930s. The critic Anthony Lejeune describes the settings of Wodehouse's novels, such as the Drones Club and Blandings Castle, as \"a fairyland\". Although some critics thought Wodehouse's fiction was based on a world that had never existed, Wodehouse affirmed that \"it did. It was going strong between the wars\", although he agreed that his version was to some extent \"a sort of artificial world of my own creation\". The novels showed a largely unchanging world, regardless of when they were written, and only rarely\u2014and mistakenly in McCrum's view\u2014did Wodehouse allow modernity to intrude, as he did in the 1966 story \"Bingo Bans the Bomb\".",
