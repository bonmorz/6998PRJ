Tyson knew of Stewart's former boxing glory and specifically asked to speak with Stewart who immediately took on a gruff attitude of the subject after witnessing Tyson's terrible behavior in his first days at the school. Bobby Stewart introduced Mike Tyson to D'Amato when Tyson was around 12 or 13 years old, after Stewart stated he had taught Tyson all he could about boxing technique and skill. D'Amato died a little over a year before Tyson became the youngest world heavyweight titleholder in history at the age of 20 years 4 months, thus supplanting Patterson's record. Rooney would later guide Tyson to the heavyweight championship sixteen months after D'Amato's death.",

As jujutsu may also involve the use of a short weapon, it cannot be used to its full potential in mixed martial arts.

The most common injuries Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioners suffer from are ACL tears in the knees, rotator cuff tears in the shoulders and spinal disc herniations, most commonly in the neck region. They are all repairable via surgery that has an extended rehab period before the athlete can return to BJJ training.
