In 1992, Nine Inch Nails relocated to 10050 Cielo Drive, Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles (renamed \"Le Pig\" by Reznor), the site of the Tate murders, when Charles Manson's \"family\" murdered Sharon Tate, wife of noted film director Roman Polanski, and four of her friends. It was used for the band to record \"Broken\", an extended play (EP) that was the first Nine Inch Nails release distributed by Interscope Records and reached the top 10 on the \"Billboard\" 200. In the liner notes, Reznor credited the 1991 Nine Inch Nails touring band as an influence on the EP's sound. He characterized \"Broken\" as a guitar-based \"blast of destruction\", and as \"a lot harder\u00a0... than \"Pretty Hate Machine\"\". The inspiration for the harder sound came from the way the live band played during concerts such as Lollapalooza. Songs from \"Broken\" earned Nine Inch Nails two Grammy Awards: a performance of the EP's first single \"Happiness in Slavery\" from Woodstock '94, and the second single \"Wish\". In reference to receiving the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for \"Wish\", Reznor joked that \"Wish\" became \"the only to ever win a Grammy that says 'fist fuck' in the lyrics.\" Against touring of the brand new material, Reznor began living and recording full-time at Le Pig, working on a follow-up free of restrictions from his record label.",

Like Erma, Carolyn's modest success in the industry wasn't matched by Aretha's blockbuster breakthrough in the late 1960s. While struggling to release a hit, she began to work behind the scenes as a songwriter, mainly for sister Aretha's work. Aretha and Carolyn's bond led to several collaborations between the two and Carolyn came up with several compositions that became classic hits including \"Ain't No Way\", recorded in 1968. The ballad single was the b-side to Aretha's top ten triumph, \"(Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You've Been Gone\". The song was strong enough to have its own airplay and eventually hit the R&B Top 10 and also went Top 20 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Carolyn's next hit for her sister was the 1973 ballad \"Angel\", which also featured Carolyn, and eldest sister Erma Franklin, in background voices advising Aretha. Aretha mentioned her sister's name in the beginning of the song in a monologue describing how Carolyn came up with the song. Another song Carolyn contributed was \"Pullin'\" with Jimmy Radcliffe. Carolyn also wrote songs for Franklin's 1970 album \"Spirit in the Dark\" and her failed 1975 album, \"You\".",

Her mother took her eldest sibling, half-brother Vaughn, with her to Buffalo, New York, in 1948. Barbara Siggers-Franklin died four years later on March 7, 1952, in Buffalo, New York. Franklin studied Business at Clark Atlanta University (then known as Clark College).  During her childhood Erma and her sisters Aretha and Carolyn sang at New Bethel Baptist Church. Later, when sister Aretha became a recording artist, Erma provided backing vocals and toured with Aretha. Among her most notable back-up performances for her sister was on Aretha's signature tune, \"Respect\". Franklin's version of \"Piece of My Heart\" was a top ten R&B hit in the US, and also peaked at number sixty-two on the U.S. Pop Singles chart. In the UK, the single was re-released in 1992, due to a successful Levi's jeans commercial (\"Cinderella\" AKA \"Night and Day\" directed by Tarsem Singh), when it peaked inside the UK Singles Chart at number nine. Franklin told an interviewer that when she first heard Janis Joplin's version on the radio, she didn't recognize it because of the vocal arrangement. Erma's solo recording career was hampered by misfortune and by contracts with record labels who did not find the most suitable material for her husky voice. In the mid-1970s Erma left the music industry, apart from occasional engagements with Aretha.

            "document": "I Say a Little Prayer . \"I Say a Little Prayer\" also returned to the Pop & R&B Top Ten in the fall of 1968 via a recording by Aretha Franklin taken from her 1968 album \"Aretha Now\". Franklin and background vocalists The Sweet Inspirations were singing the song for fun while rehearsing the songs intended for the album when the viability of their recording \"I Say a Little Prayer\" became apparent, significantly re-invented from the format of the Dionne Warwick original via the prominence of Clayton Ivey's piano work. Similar to the history of Warwick's double-sided hit, the Aretha Franklin version was intended the B-side of the July 1968 single release \"The House that Jack Built\" but began to accrue its own airplay that August. In October 1968 \"I Say a Little Prayer\" reached number ten and number three on the R&B singles chart. The same month the single was certified Gold by the RIAA. \"Prayer\" became Franklin's ninth and last consecutive Hot 100 top 10 hit on the Atlantic label. Franklin's \"Prayer\" has a special significance in her UK career, as with its September 1968 No. 4 peak it became Franklin's biggest UK hit; subsequently Franklin has surpassed that track's UK peak only with her No. 1 collaboration with George Michael, \"I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)\".",
