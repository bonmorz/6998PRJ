On September 23, 2009, during his opening monologue, O'Brien told a very brief joke about Newark, and a supposed health care program for the city's citizens that would involve Newark giving them a bus ticket out of the city. Newark mayor Cory Booker responded in a satirical YouTube video calling for O'Brien to apologize, and that Conan would be banned from ever entering Newark Liberty International Airport until doing so. Conan responded by further making fun of Newark, however, saying the only way he could get to Newark now would be like everyone else, \"through a series of poor decisions.\" He also called out Cory Booker to come on the show to air out their grievances, deciding to then ban Booker from Burbank airport, adding later that he had absolutely no power to do so. Booker subsequently banned Conan from the state of New Jersey as well as all the sister cities of Newark. In response, O'Brien read a letter on air from Elizabeth, New Jersey mayor Chris Bollwage, declaring that he will temporarily rename Terminal A of Newark Liberty (which lies in Elizabeth) the Conan O'Brien Terminal. Conan continued, saying he had created a \"geographic toilet seat\" around Newark. The mayors of Bayonne, East Orange, Kearny, Jersey City, and Elizabeth have publicly sided with Conan O'Brien. He ended this by saying, \"Your move, Mayor Booker.\" The feud was unofficially ended when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for it to end during a prepared comedy bit, telling Booker to \"chalk it up\" to Conan. The following week Conan announced that Cory Booker would be a guest on the October 16, 2009 show to mend the feud. That night, O'Brien and his wife donated $50,000 to the Newark Now Organization, and NBC Universal matched Conan's donation to total a $100,000 gift. Booker also admitted that he is a big Conan fan and often tapes shows to watch the next day or watches them on the website Hulu.",

O'Brien's successful hosting job at the 2002 54th Primetime Emmy Awards \"sent out the most resounding message yet about his growing strength as a performer\", and a year later, NBC broadcast O'Brien's tenth anniversary special in primetime. By the time Leno's contract again came up for renewal, a discussion would be needed regarding the future of \"The Tonight Show\".

Sources familiar with the situation told the \"New York Post\" that O'Brien was unhappy with NBC's plan. On January 12, O'Brien released this statement: \"I sincerely believe that delaying \"The Tonight Show\" into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. \"The Tonight Show\" at 12:05 simply isn\u2019t \"The Tonight Show.\"\" On January 21, 2010, it was announced that Conan had reached a deal with NBC that would see him exit \"The Tonight Show\" the next day. The deal also granted him $45\u00a0million, of which $12\u00a0million was designated for distribution to his staff, who had moved with Conan to Los Angeles from New York when he left \"Late Night\".",

Their father, at best, was simply a pleasant friend who fed them and played with them; at worst, he was an indecent loafer who sponged on the mother. They belonged, not to his family, but to their mother's. As they grew up they joined their uncle's group of hunters, not their father's. This matriarchal organisation of the primitive tribe, though it finds obvious evidential support in the habits of higher animals, has been questioned by many anthropologists, but of late one of them, Briffault, demonstrated its high probability in three immense volumes [\"The Mothers: A Study of the Origins of Sentiments and Institutions\"]. It is hard to escape the cogency of his arguments, for they are based upon an almost overwhelming accumulation of facts. They not only show that, in what we may plausibly assume about the institutions of early man and in what we know positively about the institutions of savages today, the concepts inseparable from a matriarchate colour every custom and every idea: they show also that those primeval concepts still condition our own ways of thinking and doing things, so that \"the societal characters of the human mind\" all seem to go back \"to the functions of the female and not to those of the male.\" Thus it appears that man, in his remote infancy, was by no means the lord of creation that he has since become.\"",

They met the host in a second-floor room at their hotel and were told to ask Josh repeated yes/no questions to help discern his location. For every \"yes\" answer, they would get a small piece to a picture on a flatscreen in front of them that would show where Josh was. For every \"no\" answer, they would lose 2 minutes off their one-hour time limit. After some \"yes\" answers, the group of three figured out that Josh was in a lighthouse, and thought that would be enough information, so they ran down to the helipad and the chopper that was to take them to Josh's location. The pilot, however, informed them that there were numerous lighthouses in the area, so they ran back up to the host and asked some more questions. They again reached a point where they thought they had enough information, but again wound up running back up to the host. At this point, Cam figured out that all they needed were \"yes\" answers from Josh to get the picture showing his location - the questions didn't necessarily have to be about his location. After asking questions such as \"Is the sun in the sky?\" and \"Is water wet?\" they finally completed the picture and knew which lighthouse they had to go to. The assignment was not over, however, until all three of them reached the top where Josh was being held. With all the \"no\" answers they'd gotten from Josh and the time wasted running up and down the stairs at the hotel, precious little was left by the time they got to the lighthouse, and Kris was unable to climb the 249 stairs up to the top in time, missing out on the $5,000 the assignment was worth.",

After bedtime (\"From Far Away We Come\"), there is a knock at the door and the mother tells Amahl to go see who it is (\"Amahl ... Yes Mother!\"). He is amazed when he sees three splendidly dressed kings (the Magi). At first the mother does not believe Amahl, but when she goes to the door to see for herself, she is stunned. The Three Kings tell the mother and Amahl they are on a long journey to give gifts to a wondrous Child and they would like to rest at their house, to which the mother agrees (\"Good Evening!\"; \"Come In!\"), saying that all she can offer is \"a cold fireplace and a bed of straw\". The mother goes to fetch firewood, and Amahl seizes the opportunity to speak with the kings. King Balthazar answers Amahl's questions about his life as a king and asks what Amahl does. Amahl responds that he was once a shepherd, but his mother had to sell his sheep. Now, he and his mother will have to go begging. Amahl then talks with King Kaspar, who is childlike, eccentric, and a bit deaf. Kaspar shows Amahl his box of magic stones, beads, and licorice, and offers Amahl some of the candy (\"Are You A Real King?\"; \"This is My Box\"). The mother returns (\"Amahl, I Told You Not To Be A Nuisance!\"). He defends himself, saying \"They kept asking me questions,\" when of course it has in fact been Amahl asking the kings questions. Amahl is told to go fetch the neighbors (\"All These Beautiful Things\"; \"Have You Seen a Child?\") so the kings may be fed and entertained properly (\"Shepherds! Shepherds!\"; \"Emily! Emily\"; \"Olives and Quinces\"; \"Dance of the Shepherds\").",

Criticisms were raised regarding Kate's intentions of continuing with the show, as well as whether or not the children were being exploited or were under emotional distress. According to lawyer Gloria Allred, \"Every state does regulate to protect the health, the safety and welfare of little child performers [...] And these little ones are only eight years old and five years old, they can\u2019t protect themselves, so the state has to be sure that they are safe in their workplace.\" In the case of the show, the children's workplace is their home. At this point there are no clear laws in Pennsylvania (where the Gosselins reside) regarding a child's appearance on a reality show. However, Pennsylvania law permits children who are at least seven years old to work in the entertainment industry, as long as certain guidelines are followed and a permit is obtained. For example, children may not work after 11:30\u00a0p.m. under most circumstances, or perform in any location that serves alcohol. Kate says that the children were happy and healthy and were never in any danger from doing the show. Jon stated they were \"in talks\" regarding ensuring the children's happiness, and that there is no truth to any reports that the children have been hurt by the series. TLC released a statement saying that the network \"fully complies with all applicable laws and regulations\" to produce the show. The statement also said that \"for an extended period of time, we have been engaged in cooperative discussions and supplied all requested information to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry\".",

Before the deal was announced, O'Brien initially had reservations about the move, as it would place comedian George Lopez's show, \"Lopez Tonight\", one hour later to midnight, effectively doing to Lopez what NBC had wanted to do with O'Brien. However, Lopez reportedly called O'Brien and expressed his excitement about the move. Lopez went on to state, \"I can't think of anything better than doing my show with Conan as my lead-in It's the beginning of a new era in late-night comedy.\" In an official press release by Turner Broadcasting, it stated that O'Brien had only begun negotiations a week prior to the official announcement of the show. Steve Koonin, President of Turner Entertainment Networks, went on to comment of the announcement, \"Conan has been the comedic voice for a generation.

Sources familiar with the situation told the \"New York Post\" that O'Brien was unhappy with NBC's plan. On January 12, O'Brien released this statement: \"I sincerely believe that delaying \"The Tonight Show\" into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. \"The Tonight Show\" at 12:05 simply isn\u2019t \"The Tonight Show.\"\" On January 21, 2010, it was announced that Conan had reached a deal with NBC that would see him exit \"The Tonight Show\" the next day.
