The International Olympic Committee has retrospectively assigned gold, silver, and bronze medals to competitors who earned 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-place finishes respectively in order to bring early Olympics in line with current awards. For Olympic Games before 1908 there is no universally accepted definition of nationality and medal tables may vary depending on the method used. For example, several Canadian nationals including George Orton competed for US university teams and Australian Stanley Rowley traveled as part of a team selected by the Amateur Athletic Association of England. The concept of \"national teams\" chosen by National Olympic Committees did not exist at this point in time.",

Some events, such as swimming, track and field, boxing, basketball, diving, field hockey and equestrian sports, were hard hit. Athletes from 25 countries won Olympic gold (the same total as in the 1984 Games and one fewer than in the 1976 Games) and competitors from 36 countries became Olympic medalists. Italy won four times more gold medals than they won in Montreal and France multiplied its gold medal tally by three. Romania won more gold medals than it had at any previous Olympics. In terms of total medals, the Moscow Olympics was Ireland's most successful games since Melbourne 1956 (winning 2 medals). The same was true for Great Britain. \"Third World\" athletes qualified for more events and took more medals than they did at any previous Olympics.",
