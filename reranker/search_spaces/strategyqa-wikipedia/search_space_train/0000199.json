To illustrate the absolute search for identity, the series writers created Adam, who is more truly alone than is anyone else. He is a creature assembled from a man, vampires, demons, and cutting edge cybernetic technology. Adam was not the first re-animated corpse to be presented in the series. \"Some Assembly Required\" in the second season also had a Frankenstein monster-like creation and \"Beauty and the Beasts\" in the third includes references to \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\"; both touch on the misuse or abuse of science. Adam is a clear reference to Frankenstein's monster, who in the novel \"Frankenstein\" (1818) tells his creator that he is the \"Adam of your labours\". Mary Shelley wrote the novel to highlight the problems progress, science, and industry create for humanity. Throughout the action, the monster constantly asks what he is and why he was created. Likewise, Adam escapes from 314 and makes his way out into the world, and much like Frankenstein's monster, he finds a little boy and asks the boy who and what he (Adam) is, then murders and dissects him. Adam is a curious character, seeking the truth and pontificating on what he has learned, even if he gained the knowledge through heartless violence. Whedon wanted Adam to be inquisitive and introspective, directing George Hertzberg to \"find the stillness\" in the character. Roz Kaveney notes that Hertzberg's \"flawed but impressive performance\" includes Adam's interesting idiosyncrasy of pausing each time he speaks, as if he is creating meaning with his own words and must consider the implications of what he is saying. Author Nikki Stafford connects Adam's need to learn about the world around him to Frankenstein's monster: Adam must understand why other people are here and why he has emotions, a peculiarity of his creation as Dr. Walsh never encouraged others to question her. One Buffy studies writer draws comparisons between Dr. Walsh and Victor Frankenstein, both of whom build monsters out of body parts \"to compensate for human vulnerability\". The moral of Shelley's novel is that what science can accomplish is not necessarily what it should.",

Other historians, whether their field of research is Grimm, Shelley, or the Castle Frankenstein, do not see any evidence for this. Scheele's claimed letter of Grimm is nowhere to be found. And no evidence can be found that Clairmont was considered the translator for Grimm's Fairy Tales.

In addition to Florescu's speculative work, the Dippel/Frankenstein merging has appeared in several works of fiction: Robert Anton Wilson's fantasy novel \"The Earth Will Shake\" features Dippel as a monster-making, globe-hopping magician who calls himself Frankenstein; the science fiction novel \"The Frankenstein Murders\" portrays Dippel as an assistant to Victor Frankenstein; Topps' three-part comic book miniseries \"The Frankenstein-Dracula War\" lists Dippel as one of Dr. Frankenstein's chief inspirations; Warren Ellis's graphic novel \"Frankenstein's Womb\" hypothesizes that Shelley indeed visited Castle Frankenstein and heard of Dippel before writing her famous work; Christopher Farnsworth's debut novel \"Blood Oath\" features a vampire trying to stop an immortal Dippel (who had once worked for Adolf Hitler) from creating a Frankenstein-like army; G.M.S.

Grunzke also argues that \"Dr. Black, Mr. Hyde\" provides commentary on evolutionary arguments for slavery by depicting Pride-as-Hyde with \"ape-like features, body hair and the like.\" Being more akin to a Frankenstein monster than a Mr. Hyde, Pride is capitalizing on \"the ways that the Frankenstein narrative was embraced by the African American community to turn the tables on this misguided Darwinist argument\" - that misguided argument being that African Americans were inferior and thus should be enslaved. By appearing as a white man to the other characters, it appears that Crain is attempting to depict the white man in a black world as being bestial By being more Frankenstein-esque, Pride gains sympathy from the audience as he struggles with being in an unknown world - despite being white when he is Mr. Hyde. Grunzke's argument stems from Elizabeth Young's argument in her book, \"Black Frankenstein: The Making of an American Metaphor\". In Young's book, she argues that the Frankenstein monster \"refuses to accept his placelessness\". The idea of the Frankenstein monster can be appropriated to African Americans as an idea where the monster is placed in an unknown land and society, and he must react violently to escape the treachery of that society. That metaphor is embraced by the African American community because of how they were forced into a society where they were treated as monsters. In the case of this film,however, the monster is a white man navigating a black world in Watts.

            "document": "Peter Cushing . \"The Curse of Frankenstein\" was an overnight success, brought both Cushing and Lee worldwide fame. The two men would continue to work together in many films for Hammer, and their names became synonymous with the company. Cushing reprised the role of Baron Victor Frankenstein in five sequels. In the first, \"The Revenge of Frankenstein\" (1958), his protagonist is sentenced to death by guillotine, but he flees and hides under the alias Doctor Victor Stein. He returned for \"The Evil of Frankenstein\" (1963), where the Baron has a carnival hypnotist resurrect his monster's inactive brain, and \"Frankenstein Created Woman\" (1967), in which the Frankenstein's monster is a woman played by \"Playboy\" magazine centrefold model Susan Denberg. Cushing played the lead role twice more in \"Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed\" (1969) and \"Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell\" (1974). The former film portrays Frankenstein as a far more ruthless character than had been seen before, and features a scene in which Cushing's Frankenstein rapes the character played by Veronica Carlson. Neither Carlson nor Cushing wanted to do the scene, filmed despite director Terence Fisher\u2019s objections, and the controversial sequence was edited out of the film for its American release. In \"Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell\", Cushing portrayed Frankenstein as having gone completely mad, in a fitting coda to the previous movies.",
