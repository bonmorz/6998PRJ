For some, straight edge is a simple lifestyle preference, but for others it is a political stance. In many cases, it is a rejection of the perceived self-destructive qualities of punk and hardcore culture.

Star's first time drinking alcohol, he claimed, was on the flight back from Miami. Jackson allegedly handed him a Diet Coke can filled with wine. Star testified he did not know what the drink was when he tasted it, and that it reminded him of the smell of rubbing alcohol (a comparison Gavin also made).
