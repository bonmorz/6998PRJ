He began martial arts at an early age thanks to the inspiration from his uncle, Martial Arts Hall of Famer Robert Arel. At 7 he began Isshin-Ryu and then moved to Jeet Kune Do . During his time training Jeet Kune Do he began a rigorous training schedule that would set the pace for the rest of his martial arts career, training as much as possible outside of academic classes. After 6 years of Jeet Kune Do his academy changed directions and began opening up the style to encompass \u201cMMA\u201d training. Under his academy\u2019s belt system he achieved the rank of black belt and began competing in boxing, kickboxing, and grappling tournaments. During this time Arel also competed for an alternate position on the World Kickboxing Association\u2019s US National Kickboxing Team. In 2004, after serving with the US Army National Guard in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Arel began his career in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu when he joined an Alliance Jiu Jitsu affiliate in Charlotte, NC. He achieved the rank of purple belt under the guidance of the late Luis Togno. After several additional years of training in a no-gi combat style jiu jitsu, Arel made the decision to make Brazilian Jiu Jitsu his life\u2019s work and dedicate himself full-time to attaining the rank of black belt. In 2009 Arel moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and achieved the rank of brown belt under the legendary Gracie Barra black belt Roberto \u201cGordo\u201d Correa. After a brief return home he once again traveled to Rio where he was promoted to black belt under Gordo on December 11, 2010. Jeremy Arel is a graduate from Winthrop University with a degree in Health & Physical Education and is the owner/head instructor of Great Grappling Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in Fort Mill, SC, just outside Charlotte, NC.",

However, it is very effective as a fighter could quickly dislocate their opponents joints or knock them out with a choke-hold if they choose to. The injury rate is around 9.2-38.6 per 1000 athlete exposures. This is lower than in Mixed martial arts (236-286 per 1000), boxing (210-420 per 1000), judo (25.3-130.6) and Taekwondo (20.5-139.5). It is similar to wrestling which also uses grappling instead of striking; the few injuries that may be incurred in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu usually affect the joints and rarely the head. The most common injuries Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioners suffer from are ACL tears in the knees, rotator cuff tears in the shoulders and spinal disc herniations, most commonly in the neck region. They are all repairable via surgery that has an extended rehab period before the athlete can return to BJJ training. Also many athletes suffer from less minor injuries, such as elbow and wrist tendonitis, due to overtraining and the grappling nature of the martial art, which can be strenuous and taxing for the joints and the tendons.",
