Wodehouse believed that one of the factors that made his stories humorous was his view of life, and he stated that \"If you take life fairly easily, then you take a humorous view of things. It's probably because you were born that way.\" He carried this view through into his writing, describing the approach as \"making the thing a sort of musical comedy without music, and ignoring real life altogether\". The literary critic Edward L. Galligan considers Wodehouse's stories to show his mastery in adapting the form of the American musical comedy for his writings. Wodehouse would ensure that his first draft was as carefully and accurately done as possible, correcting and refining the prose as he wrote, and would then make another good copy, before proof reading again and then making a final copy for his publisher. Most of Wodehouse's canon is set in an undated period around the 1920s and 1930s. The critic Anthony Lejeune describes the settings of Wodehouse's novels, such as the Drones Club and Blandings Castle, as \"a fairyland\". Although some critics thought Wodehouse's fiction was based on a world that had never existed, Wodehouse affirmed that \"it did. It was going strong between the wars\", although he agreed that his version was to some extent \"a sort of artificial world of my own creation\". The novels showed a largely unchanging world, regardless of when they were written, and only rarely\u2014and mistakenly in McCrum's view\u2014did Wodehouse allow modernity to intrude, as he did in the 1966 story \"Bingo Bans the Bomb\".",

There was even an aunt, Marcia, Dowager Marchioness of Caterham, who, having thought Bundle lived largely for pleasure, nevertheless recognised (as did George Lomax) her potential as a political hostess. In this context, Aunt Agatha's aspirations for Bertie Wooster in the Wodehouse books have a certain resonance, while Lord Caterham's ready acceptance of Eversleigh's golfing credentials matched Lord Emsworth's preference for young people who showed interest in his pigs.",

He wrote or adapted four plays for the West End; \"Leave it to Psmith\" (1930), which he adapted in collaboration with Ian Hay, was the only one to have a long run. The reviewer in \"The Manchester Guardian\" praised the play, but commented: \"It is Mr Wodehouse's own inimitable narrative comments and descriptions in his own person of the antics of his puppets that one misses. They cannot be got into a play and they are at least half the fun of the novels.\" In 1934 Wodehouse collaborated with Bolton on the book for Cole Porter's \"Anything Goes\" (Porter wrote his own lyrics), but at the last minute their version was almost entirely rewritten by others at the instigation of the producer, who disliked the original script. Concentrating on writing novels and short stories, Wodehouse reached the peak of his productivity in this decade, averaging two books each year, and grossing an annual \u00a3100,000.",

Eleanor Wodehouse was also of ancient aristocratic ancestry. She was visiting her sister in Guildford when Wodehouse was born there prematurely. The boy was baptised at the Church of St Nicolas, Guildford, and was named after his godfather, Pelham von Donop. Wodehouse wrote in 1957, \"If you ask me to tell you frankly if I like the name Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, I must confess that I do not... I was named after a godfather, and not a thing to show for it but a small silver mug which I lost in 1897.\" The first name was rapidly elided to \"Plum\", the name by which Wodehouse became known to family and friends.",

Hall identifies several techniques used by Wodehouse to achieve comic effect, including the creation of new words through adding or removing prefixes and suffixes, so when Pongo Twistleton removes the housemaid Elsie Bean from a cupboard, Wodehouse writes that the character \"de-Beaned the cupboard\". Wodehouse created new words by splitting others in two, thus Wodehouse divides \"hobnobbing\" when he writes: \"To offer a housemaid a cigarette is not hobbing.

When he was two, the brothers were brought to England, where they were placed under the care of an English nanny in a house adjoining that of Eleanor's father and mother. The boys' parents returned to Hong Kong and became virtual strangers to their sons. Such an arrangement was then normal for middle-class families based in the colonies. The lack of parental contact, and the harsh regime of some of those \"in loco parentis\", left permanent emotional scars on many children from similar backgrounds, including the writers Thackeray, Saki, Kipling and Walpole. Wodehouse was more fortunate; his nanny, Emma Roper, was strict but not unkind, and both with her and later at his different schools Wodehouse had a generally happy childhood. His recollection was that \"it went like a breeze from start to finish, with everybody I met understanding me perfectly\". The biographer Robert McCrum suggests that nonetheless Wodehouse's isolation from his parents left a psychological mark, causing him to avoid emotional engagement both in life and in his works. Another biographer, Frances Donaldson, writes, \"Deprived so early, not merely of maternal love, but of home life and even a stable background, Wodehouse consoled himself from the youngest age in an imaginary world of his own.\"",
