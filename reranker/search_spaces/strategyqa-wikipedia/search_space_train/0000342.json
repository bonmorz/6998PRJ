Club\"s Nathan Rabin viewed its \"R&B heavy\" material as a weakness, but gave the album a B+ rating and praised Ludacris's lyricism, writing \"Ludacris remains an underrated lyricist with unparalleled verbal dexterity. His liquid flow crams an awful lot of polysyllabic words into even the tawdriest sex jam, and no rapper alive conveys joy as effortlessly or infectiously\". Giving it 2\u00bd out of 4 stars, \"Los Angeles Times\" critic August Brown called \"Battle of the Sexes\" \"another welcome occasion to listen to Luda enjoying the real love of his life -- the sound of his own voice\", and described its music as \"fizzy pillow talk and respectfully tawdry club fodder\". Despite viewing Ludacris's lyrics as from the male perspective, \"USA Today\"s Elysa Gardner commended him for his humor and wrote that the album is \"more appealing, and more artful, when Ludacris directs his crude, breezy rhymes where they're best suited: into unabashed displays of loopy lust and boneheaded bravado\". \"XXL\" writer Rondell Conway gave \"Battle of the Sexes\" an XL rating and shared a similar sentiment, stating \"Luda may not have evened the playing field, but he certainly created an excellent musical forum for the sexes to air out their differences\". \"Newsday\"s Glenn Gamboa gave the album a B rating and commended Ludacris for his musical balance, writing \"Not only does Luda know when a song needs an R&B crooner or a female voice, he knows when he needs to speed up a flow or rough up a rhyme\".",

Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music. The word \"song\" is widely misused by people in the popular music industry to describe any musical composition, whether sung or played only by instruments. People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score,\" which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in their mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.",

In Western practice, art music is considered primarily a written musical tradition, preserved in some form of music notation rather than being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings, as popular and traditional music usually are. Historically, most western art music has been written down using the standard forms of music notation that evolved in Europe, beginning well before the Renaissance and reaching its maturity in the Romantic period. The identity of a \"work\" or \"piece\" of art music is usually defined by the notated version rather than by a particular performance, and is primarily associated with the composer rather than the performer (though composers may leave performers with some opportunity for interpretation or improvisation). This is so particularly in the case of western classical music. Art music may include certain forms of jazz, though some feel that jazz is primarily a form of popular music.",

Accompanists often play keyboard instruments (e.g., piano, pipe organ, synthesizer or, in folk music and traditional styles, a guitar. A number of classical pianists have found success as accompanists rather than soloists; arguably the best known example is Gerald Moore, well known as a Lieder accompanist. In some American schools, the title \"collaborative pianist\" (or collaborative artist) is replacing the title accompanist, because in many art songs and contemporary classical music songs, the piano part is complex and demands an advanced level of musicianship and technique. The term \"accompanist\" also refers to a musician (typically a pianist) who plays for singers, dancers, and other performers at an audition or rehearsal\u2014but who does not necessarily participate in the ensemble that plays for the final performance (which might be an orchestra or a big band).",
