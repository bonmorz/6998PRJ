Although they occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average, it is estimated that they recur at any given place only once every 360 to 410 years, on average. The total eclipse lasts for only a maximum of a few minutes at any location, because the Moon's umbra moves eastward at over 1700\u00a0km/h. Totality currently can never last more than 7\u00a0min 32\u00a0s. This value changes over the millennia and is currently decreasing. By the 8th millennium, the longest theoretically possible total eclipse will be less than 7\u00a0min 2\u00a0s. The last time an eclipse longer than 7 minutes occurred was June 30, 1973 (7 min 3 sec). Observers aboard a Concorde supersonic aircraft were able to stretch totality for this eclipse to about 74 minutes by flying along the path of the Moon's umbra.

Females are also known to migrate from deep to shallow water as the pregnancy continues.This migration pattern is known to influence embryonic growth. Baby dogfish, also known as pups, found near Newfoundland had an average of 1.1\u00a0cm/month and 24 month pregnancy period, while a warmer area such as Massachusetts had an average of 1.3\u00a0cm/month and 20-22 month pregnancy period. The sexual maturity of a dogfish is hard to determine because it varies anywhere from 10\u201330 years. Food supplies and water temperature also play a role in growth and development of the dogfish. The length of a newborn Pacific dogfish is around 22 to 23 centimeters. Females seem to be significantly larger than male dogfish. At sexual maturity the male dogfish is 60\u201370\u00a0cm while the female is about 70\u2013100\u00a0cm. This length difference can be caused by the reproduction process of the female. Their bodies need to be bigger to carry and protect their eggs within their bodies. Pacific dogfish are ovoviviparous. This means that they produce eggs that hatch within the body.

Menstruation, also known as a period or monthly, is the regular discharge of blood and mucosal tissue (known as menses) from the inner lining of the uterus through the vagina.

However, periods may occasionally start as young as eight years old and still be considered normal. The average age of the first period is generally later in the developing world, and earlier in the developed world. The typical length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next is 21 to 45 days in young women, and 21 to 31 days in adults (an average of 28 days). Bleeding usually lasts around 2 to 7 days. Menstruation stops occurring after menopause, which usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age. Periods also stop during pregnancy and typically do not resume during the initial months of breastfeeding. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms prior to menstruation. Common signs and symptoms include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability, and mood changes. These may interfere with normal life, therefore qualifying as premenstrual syndrome, in 20 to 30% of women. In 3 to 8%, symptoms are severe. A lack of periods, known as amenorrhea, is when periods do not occur by age 15 or have not occurred in 90 days. Other problems with the menstrual cycle include painful periods and abnormal bleeding such as bleeding between periods or heavy bleeding. Menstruation in other animals occurs in primates, such as apes and monkeys, as well as bats and the elephant shrew. The menstrual cycle occurs due to the rise and fall of hormones. This cycle results in the thickening of the lining of the uterus, and the growth of an egg, (which is required for pregnancy). The egg is released from an ovary around day fourteen in the cycle; the thickened lining of the uterus provides nutrients to an embryo after implantation. If pregnancy does not occur, the lining is released in what is known as menstruation.",

In order to preserve the Thai elephant population, the farm has four points of emphasis that they center their work around. These points are: rescue, recovery, reproduction, and reintroduction. Rescuing means taking elephants that have nowhere else to go. Theerapat says part of Patara's mission is to \"adopt elephants people don't want anymore \u2013 healthy ones with the potential to live 80 years and produce a baby.\" One example is Noi/Nui, who was rescued from a circus. Patara also adopts elephants from the streets of Bangkok, who are used by their mahouts to get money from the tourism industry. Some of their elephants used to work in the illegal logging industry. Therefore, the rescued elephants recovery process is the farm's first priority. For reproduction, Patara focuses on actual mating instead of artificial insemination. This is because Theerapat believes it is more successful. In terms of reintroduction, Patara releases its elephants into the wild whenever possible. However, Theerapat believes simply releasing them is not the answer since, in his words, \"you can't just suddenly put domestic elephants into the wild. Their survival rates are too low.\" Therefore, the farm's belief is that through education and one-on-one interactions with elephants, people will understand elephants and what is needed for their welfare. This is why Patara encourages visitors to come and learn about elephants by caring for them. In terms of reproductive success, so far they have breed 24 elephants in 10 years. Every year, around 2\u20133 baby elephants are born. Five baby elephants were born in 2013. The first baby who was born at the farm is a male elephant named Puchan.",

Checking their elephant's health includes checking for teeth health, intestinal health, and sweat gland health, and checking for sleeping problems. In order to check for intestinal and teeth health, visitors check their elephant's excrement. To check for intestinal problems, they are first told to count their elephant's number of droppings. If there are around six pieces per bathroom time, then the elephant is considered healthy because it has been eating enough. Elephants can eat around 300 pounds of food per day. Furthermore, visitors are asked to smell the elephant dung and make sure it doesn't smell bad. They are also asked to squeeze the dung to make sure it is not too watery. To check for teeth problems, visitors check to see if the dung is finely ground. If for example whole leaves are found in the dung, then the elephant's teeth are not working properly. Elephants have 6 sets of teeth in their lifetime, and lose their last set of teeth near the end of their life. If their food is not being properly chewed, this means they are old and nearing the end of their life. To checked sweat gland health, visitors touch near the base of their elephant's toenails to check for sweat. To check for sleeping problems, visitors check to see if their elephant has dirt on its sides. This is because elephants, who sleep for only around four hours a night, sleep on their sides while sleeping deeply. If they do not have dirt marks on their sides, then they slept standing up. Elephants who sleep standing up are generally sick. After the elephants' health has been checked, visitors are given a branch with leaves to sweep the dirt off their elephant's backs. To do this, visitors are told to gently pull on their elephant's ear to get them to sit down. The next stage in cleaning their elephant is when visitors and their elephants are led to a nearby waterfall bathing area. This is where the visitors begin to brush and bathe their elephant. To bathe their elephant, they toss water from the bathing area onto them with buckets. Visitors brush their elephant with hard-bristled brushes to get the dirt off of them. Bathing them is important, since when riding them dirt could get pushed into their skin and cause it to get infected.",
