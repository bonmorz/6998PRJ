In other US states, there is also another variant of the McChicken Sandwich called the \"Cheddar Onion McChicken\", which is a McChicken with caramelized onions and a slice of white cheddar cheese, both on a toasted bun. In most countries outside of the US (such as India), the McChicken comes on a sesame-seed bun and is not spicy. In Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia (where it originally appeared as a promotional menu item but, due to its popularity, became a full-time menu item) and New Zealand, the McChicken also comes on a sesame-seed bun but with lettuce and a flavoured mayonnaise sauce called \"McChicken Sauce\".",
