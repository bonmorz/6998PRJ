Henry Corbin, who considers al-Farabi to be a <nowiki>crypto-</nowiki>Shi'ite, says that his ideas should be understood as a \"prophetic philosophy\" instead of being interpreted politically. On the other hand, Charles Butterworth contends that nowhere in his work does al-Farabi speak of a prophet-legislator or revelation (even the word philosophy is scarcely mentioned), and the main discussion that takes place concerns the positions of \"king\" and \"statesmen\". Occupying a middle position is David Reisman, who like Corbin believes that al-Farabi did not want to expound a political doctrine (although he does not go so far to attribute it to Islamic Gnosticism either). He argues that al-Farabi was using different types of society as examples, in the context of an ethical discussion, to show what effect correct or incorrect thinking could have. Lastly, Joshua Parens argues that al-Farabi was slyly asserting that a pan-Islamic society could not be made, by using reason to show how many conditions (such as moral and deliberative virtue) would have to be met, thus leading the reader to conclude that humans are not fit for such a society. Some other authors like Mykhaylo Yakubovych argue that for al-Farabi religion (\"milla\") and philosophy (\"falsafa\") constituted the same praxeological value (i.e. basis for \"amal al-fadhil\"\u2014\"virtuous deed\"), while its epistemological level (\"ilm\"\u2014\"knowledge\") was different.",

Henry Corbin, who considers al-Farabi to be a <nowiki>crypto-</nowiki>Shi'ite, says that his ideas should be understood as a \"prophetic philosophy\" instead of being interpreted politically. On the other hand, Charles Butterworth contends that nowhere in his work does al-Farabi speak of a prophet-legislator or revelation (even the word philosophy is scarcely mentioned), and the main discussion that takes place concerns the positions of \"king\" and \"statesmen\". Occupying a middle position is David Reisman, who like Corbin believes that al-Farabi did not want to expound a political doctrine (although he does not go so far to attribute it to Islamic Gnosticism either). He argues that al-Farabi was using different types of society as examples, in the context of an ethical discussion, to show what effect correct or incorrect thinking could have. Lastly, Joshua Parens argues that al-Farabi was slyly asserting that a pan-Islamic society could not be made, by using reason to show how many conditions (such as moral and deliberative virtue) would have to be met, thus leading the reader to conclude that humans are not fit for such a society. Some other authors like Mykhaylo Yakubovych argue that for al-Farabi religion (\"milla\") and philosophy (\"falsafa\") constituted the same praxeological value (i.e. basis for \"amal al-fadhil\"\u2014\"virtuous deed\"), while its epistemological level (\"ilm\"\u2014\"knowledge\") was different.",

However, Deborah Black mentions we have cause to be skeptical as to whether this was the mature and developed view of al-Farabi, as later thinkers such as Ibn Tufayl, Averroes and Ibn Bajjah would assert that he repudiated this view in his commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics, which has been lost to modern experts.",

During the time of the Umayyad Caliphate, at latest, the scholars of the emerging Islamic society had become familiar with the classical philosophical and scientific traditions of the world they had conquered. The collection of classical works and their translation into the Arabian language initiated a period which is known today as the Islamic Golden Age. According to Hourani (1991), the works of the classical scholars of antiquity were met with considerable intellectual curiosity by Islamic scholars. Hourani quotes al-Kindi (c. 801\u2013873 AD), \"the father of Islamic philosophy\", as follows: \"We should not be ashamed to acknowledge truth from whatever source it comes to us, even if it is brought to us by former generations and foreign peoples. For him who seeks the truth there is nothing of higher value than truth itself.\" The works of Aristotle, in particular his \"Nicomachean Ethics\", had a profound influence on the Islamic scholars of the Golden Age like Al-Farabi (870\u2013950 AD), Abu al-Hassan al-Amiri (d. 992 AD) and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (ca. 980\u20131037 AD). In general, the Islamic philosophers saw no contradiction between philosophy and the religion of Islam. However, according to Hourani, al-Farabi also wrote that philosophy in its pure form was reserved for an intellectual elite, and that ordinary people should rely for guidance on the \"sharia\". The distinction between a scholarly elite and the less educated masses \"was to become a commonplace of Islamic thought\". As exemplified by the works of al-Razi (854\u2013925 AD), during later times, philosophy \"was carried on as a private activity, largely by medical men, pursued with discretion, and often met with suspicion\".",
