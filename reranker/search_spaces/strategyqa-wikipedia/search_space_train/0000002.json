A further ambiguity with yes\u2013no questions, in addition to that of polarity, is the ambiguity of whether an \"exclusive\" or \"inclusive\" disjunction is meant by the word \"or\", as it can represent either. Conventionally, in English yes\u2013no questions the \"or\" represents an exclusive disjunction. However, as with the \"Would you like an apple or an orange?\" question mentioned earlier, to which one possible answer, as a yes\u2013no question, is \"yes.\", yes\u2013no questions can also be taken to be \"inclusive\" disjunctions. The informativeness of the \"or\" in the question is low, especially if the second alternative in the question is \"something\" or \"things\". The \"exclusive\" and \"inclusive\" can be determined often in spoken language (the speaker will often lower their pitch at the end of an \"exclusive\" question, as opposed to raising it at the end of an \"inclusive\" question), but it is a frequent source of humour for computer scientists and others familiar with Boolean logic, who will give responses such as \"yes\" to questions such as \"Would you like chicken or roast beef for dinner?\". However, the ambiguity is not confined to humour. The apple-or-orange question may be legitimately asking whether either is wanted, for example, and \"Would you like an apple or something?\" is indeed \"expecting\" either \"yes\" or \"no\" as a proper answer rather than the answer \"Something\" that an exclusive disjunction would be requesting.",

Thermoregulation is the ability of an organism to keep its body temperature within certain boundaries, even when the surrounding temperature is very different. A thermoconforming organism, by contrast, simply adopts the surrounding temperature as its own body temperature, thus avoiding the need for internal thermoregulation. The internal thermoregulation process is one aspect of homeostasis: a state of dynamic stability in an organism's internal conditions, maintained far from thermal equilibrium with its environment (the study of such processes in zoology has been called physiological ecology). If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal, a condition known as hyperthermia occurs. For humans, this occurs when the body is exposed to constant temperatures of approximately , and with prolonged exposure (longer than a few hours) at this temperature and up to around death is almost inevitable. Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the wet bulb temperature is sustained above for six hours. The opposite condition, when body temperature decreases below normal levels, is known as hypothermia. It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction, causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it. Normal body temperature is around , and hypothermia sets in when the core body temperature gets lower than . Usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures, hypothermia is usually treated by methods that attempt to raise the body temperature back to a normal range.",

In humans, it is defined as a body core temperature below . Symptoms depend on the temperature. In mild hypothermia there is shivering and mental confusion. In moderate hypothermia shivering stops and confusion increases. In severe hypothermia, there may be paradoxical undressing, in which a person removes his or her clothing, as well as an increased risk of the heart stopping. Hypothermia has two main types of causes. It classically occurs from exposure to extreme cold. It may also occur from any condition that decreases heat production or increases heat loss. Commonly this includes alcohol intoxication but may also include low blood sugar, anorexia, and advanced age. Body temperature is usually maintained near a constant level of through thermoregulation. Efforts to increase body temperature involve shivering, increased voluntary activity, and putting on warmer clothing. Hypothermia may be diagnosed based on either a person's symptoms in the presence of risk factors or by measuring a person's core temperature. The treatment of mild hypothermia involves warm drinks, warm clothing, and physical activity. In those with moderate hypothermia, heating blankets and warmed intravenous fluids are recommended. People with moderate or severe hypothermia should be moved gently. In severe hypothermia, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass may be useful. In those without a pulse, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is indicated along with the above measures. Rewarming is typically continued until a person's temperature is greater than . If there is no improvement at this point or the blood potassium level is greater than 12\u00a0mmol/liter at any time, resuscitation may be discontinued. Hypothermia is the cause of at least 1,500 deaths a year in the United States. It is more common in older people and males. One of the lowest documented body temperatures from which someone with accidental hypothermia has survived is in a near-drowning of a 7-year-old girl in Sweden. Survival after more than six hours of CPR has been described. For those for whom ECMO or bypass is used, survival is around 50%. Deaths due to hypothermia have played an important role in many wars. The term is from Greek \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf, \"ypo\", meaning \"under\", and \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1, \"therm\u00eda\", meaning \"heat\".

In Europe, mean annual heat related mortalities are 304 in north Finland, 445 in Athens, and 40 in London, while cold related mortalities are 2457, 2533, and 3129 respectively. According to Keatinge \"et al.\" (2000), \"populations in Europe have adjusted successfully to mean summer temperatures ranging from 13.5\u00b0C to 24.1\u00b0C, and can be expected to adjust to global warming predicted for the next half century with little sustained increase in heat related mortality.\"",

Depending on latitude, the temperature beneath the upper of Earth's surface maintains a nearly constant temperature between 10 and 16\u00a0\u00b0C (50 and 60\u00a0\u00b0F), if the temperature is undisturbed by the presence of a heat pump. Like a refrigerator or air conditioner, these systems use a heat pump to force the transfer of heat from the ground. Heat pumps can transfer heat from a cool space to a warm space, against the natural direction of flow, or they can enhance the natural flow of heat from a warm area to a cool one. The core of the heat pump is a loop of refrigerant pumped through a vapor-compression refrigeration cycle that moves heat. Air-source heat pumps are typically more efficient at heating than pure electric heaters, even when extracting heat from cold winter air, although efficiencies begin dropping significantly as outside air temperatures drop below 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F). A ground source heat pump exchanges heat with the ground. This is much more energy-efficient because underground temperatures are more stable than air temperatures through the year. Seasonal variations drop off with depth and disappear below to due to thermal inertia. Like a cave, the shallow ground temperature is warmer than the air above during the winter and cooler than the air in the summer. A ground source heat pump extracts ground heat in the winter (for heating) and transfers heat back into the ground in the summer (for cooling). Some systems are designed to operate in one mode only, heating or cooling, depending on climate.",

The survival rate for adults whose body temperature has decreased to below is 10%\u201333%. Prior to B\u00e5genholm's accident, the lowest survived body temperature was , which had been recorded in a child. Gilbert said \"victims of very deep accidental hypothermia with circulatory arrest should be seen as potentially resuscitable with a prospect of full recovery. The key success factors of such marginal resuscitation efforts are early bystander actions with vigorous CPR and early warning of the emergency system, early dispatch of adequate rescue units (ground and air-ambulances) and good co-ordination between the resources outside and inside the hospital, aggressive rewarming and a spirit not to give up.\" General practitioner Jel Coward from Tywyn, Wales, said persons who are victims of extreme hypothermia are often mistakenly thought dead because it can be difficult to detect a pulse on them. He said this case \"really does bring it home to us how cautious one has to be before diagnosing death in people who are cold.\"",

When used for heating a building with an outside temperature of, for example, 10\u00a0\u00b0C, a typical air-source heat pump (ASHP) has a COP of 3 to 4, whereas an electrical resistance heater has a COP of 1.0. That is, one joule of electrical energy will cause a resistance heater to produce only one joule of useful heat, while under ideal conditions, one joule of electrical energy can cause a heat pump to move three or four joules of heat from a cooler place to a warmer place. Note that an air source heat pump is more efficient in hotter climates than cooler ones, so when the weather is much warmer the unit will perform with a higher COP (as it has a smaller temperature gap to bridge). When there is a wide temperature differential between the hot and cold reservoirs, the COP is lower (worse). In extreme cold weather the COP will go down to 1.0.",
