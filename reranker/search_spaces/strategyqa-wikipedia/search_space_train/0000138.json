It was a dark time when there weren't any more movies, and it blew our minds that there could be more.\" The \"Thrawn\" trilogy itself is widely credited with reviving interest in the \"Star Wars\" franchise. In 2010, \"\" creator Filoni expressed interest in using Thrawn in that series. Some fans of Zahn's \"Thrawn\" series had long hoped the books would be adapted, and after the 2012 announcement that The Walt Disney Company had acquired Lucasfilm and planned to produce film sequels to \"Return of the Jedi\", Zahn commented that if material from the expanded universe was used in the films, \"we'd all be thrilled to death\".",
