The contestant starting from the left podium, will get to choose one of the six celebrity icons to ask them a survey-related multiple-choice question of three answers. Every correct answer is worth $200. In replacement with the Hero or Zero card, which was removed for the entire season, an incorrect answer will result in a 'Kena Fine', which deducts the contestant's winnings from $1 up to $100, with a penalty of up to $261 (the denominations were $1, $10, $20, $50, $80 and $100; the winnings cannot go below $0 or end with negative score). The next contestant will have to answer from the remaining two options; a correct answer will earn $100, but an incorrect answer will also deduct by the same denomination. This made for a maximum possible winnings of $900.",

Every time we switch tasks, we are hurting our work. Davidson argues, however, that these small distractions afforded by technology should be thought of as innovations. \"When we feel distracted, something\u2019s up.

An important element in the Neoplatonic answer to these questions is its reaction to Scepticism. In response to the sceptical position that we only know the appearances presented by our senses, and not the world as it is, Plotinus placed the object of knowledge inside the soul itself, and accounted for this interior truth through the soul's kinship with its own productive principles.",

Among the simple solutions, the \"combined doors solution\" comes closest to a conditional solution, as we saw in the discussion of approaches using the concept of odds and Bayes theorem. It is based on the deeply rooted intuition that \"revealing information that is already known does not affect probabilities\". But, knowing that the host can open one of the two unchosen doors to show a goat does not mean that opening a specific door would not affect the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen door. The point is, though we know in advance that the host will open a door and reveal a goat, we do not know \"which\" door he will open. If the host chooses uniformly at random between doors hiding a goat (as is the case in the standard interpretation), this probability indeed remains unchanged, but if the host can choose non-randomly between such doors, then the specific door that the host opens reveals additional information. The host can always open a door revealing a goat \"and\" (in the standard interpretation of the problem) the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen door does not change, but it is \"not because\" of the former that the latter is true. Solutions based on the assertion that the host's actions cannot affect the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen appear persuasive, but the assertion is simply untrue unless each of the host's two choices are equally likely, if he has a choice (Falk 1992:207,213). The assertion therefore needs to be justified; without justification being given, the solution is at best incomplete. The answer can be correct but the reasoning used to justify it is defective.",

The differences at the sensory and perceptual levels between agents require that some means of ensuring at least a partial correlation can be achieved that allows the updatings involved in communication to take place. The process in an informative statement begins with the parties hypothetically assuming that they are referring to the \"same\" entity or \"property\", even though their selections from their sensory fields cannot match; we can call this mutually imagined projection the \"logical subject\" of the statement. The speaker then produces the logical predicate which effects the proposed updating of the \"referent\". If the statement goes through, the hearer will now have a different percept and concept of the \"referent\"\u2014perhaps even seeing it now as two things and not one. The radical conclusion is that we are premature in conceiving of the external as already sorted into singular \"objects\" in the first place, since we only need to behave \"as if\" they are already logically singular. The diagram at the beginning of this entry would thus be thought of as a false picture of the actual case, since to draw \"an\" object as already selected from the real is only to treat the practically needful, but strictly false, hypothesis of objects-as-logically-singular as ontologically given. The proponents of this view thus argue that there is no need actually \"to believe\" in the singularity of an object since we can manage perfectly well by \"mutually imagining\" that 'it' is singular. A proponent of this theory can thus ask the direct realist feels why he or she thinks it is necessary to move to taking the imagining of singularity for real when there is no practical difference in the outcome in action. Therefore, although there are selections from our sensory fields which for the time being we treat as if they were objects, they are only provisional, open to corrections at any time, and, hence, far from being direct \"representations\" of pre-existing singularities, they retain an experimental character. Virtual constructs or no, they remain, however, selections that are causally linked to the real and can surprise us at any time\u2014which removes any danger of solipsism in this theory. This approach dovetails with the philosophy known as social constructivism.",

The number of correct answers is then revealed, but not specifically which ones. If the contestant has all four correct, he/she wins the round. Otherwise, the suspects are given a chance to change the responses they believe are incorrect, and can win the round by choosing correctly. The suspects win by default if all four of the contestant's answers are incorrect. If the suspects fail to change all answers missed by the contestant, neither side wins the round.",

In this round, questions have two possible answers. The host first reads the two answers and then follows with the question. All four contestants then have approximately 30 seconds to write down their answers onto the card included in their game kits. Once all contestants have verbally acknowledged that they have written down their answers, the host asks them each to reveal their answers in a sequence determined by the producers. The host then reveals the correct answer, and each contestant that answered the question correctly is awarded the prize money assigned for that question. Contestants who answered incorrectly receive no prize money. After the correct answer to the first question has been revealed, all four contestants are given the next question. The process is then repeated with three additional questions. The first question is worth $100, with subsequent questions increasing by that amount, up to $400 for the fourth question. The lowest scoring contestant at the end of the round is eliminated and leaves with nothing.",

Items that measure each attribute must maintain the hierarchical ordering of the attributes as specified by the cognitive model while also measuring increasingly complex cognitive processes. These item types may be in either multiple choice or constructed response format. To date, the AHM has been used with items that are scored dichotomously where 1 corresponds to a correct answer and 0 corresponds to an incorrect answer. Therefore, a student's test performance can be summarized by a vector of correct and incorrect responses in the form of 1's and 0's. This vector then serves as the input for the psychometric analysis where the examinee's attribute mastery is estimated.",

He states, \"Calling someone naachnewali or naachnewala has become a way of putting them down. We need to understand that dance is about seduction. For me, the story of Lord Vishnu taking the form of Mohini and dancing to seduce Bhasmasura is one of the most powerful stories. We don\u2019t understand that the story of Natraj also relates to seduction. But somehow, the word seduction has taken a negative connotation now. Through dance, we can understand a lot about Indian culture, history, geography and more. It\u2019s about time we did that.\"",

Rebecca Hawkes of \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote in her review, \"At times during this week's episode, 'The Adversary', it felt as if we were inching nearer to a few of the answers we're so desperately craving. At others, we felt hopelessly lost \u2014 but in the best possible way.\" David Crow of Den of Geek said in his review, \"while the episode as a whole was quite powerful, it is stained just enough to cost it that fifth star. Nonetheless, 'The Adversary' was high-quality television as a whole, and there is undoubtedly plenty of fun (and answers) to be had in the first season's final four episodes to come.\" He gave the episode a four out of five. Erik Kain of \"Forbes\" also reviewed the episode, saying, \"this feels very much like the calm before the storm. That moment right before the wave comes crashing down, casting everything in its wake against the rocky shore. Then again, we're just six episodes deep. Judging by the restraint shown so far, we may have another episode or two of growing mystery, rising tension, and random acts of crazy disturbing violence before everything implodes.\"",
