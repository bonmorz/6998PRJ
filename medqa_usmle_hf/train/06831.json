The patient's symptoms suggest pulmonary edema, which is commonly treated with loop diuretics that act on the Na/K/Cl symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, such as furosemide. Option A describes thiazide diuretics, which act on the Na/Cl cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule and is not as effective for pulmonary edema. Option C describes carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, which are typically used for glaucoma and altitude sickness. Option D describes aldosterone receptor blockers, which are useful for hypertension and heart failure management, but not for immediate relief of pulmonary edema."

The drug that acts on the Na/K/Cl symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle is a loop diuretic, which is used for rapid relief of symptoms in acute heart failure.
