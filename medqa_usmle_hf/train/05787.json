These medications work by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening and therefore increasing inhibition in the brain, leading to a reduction in seizure activity. Option A, prolongation of chloride channel opening, is the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam, which can also be used to stop seizures, but they were not mentioned in the question stem. Option C, blockage of voltage-gated calcium channels, is the mechanism of action of medications like gabapentin, which are used to prevent seizures but not to stop an ongoing seizure. Option D, inactivation of sodium channels, is the mechanism of action of medications like phenytoin which can be used to treat and prevent seizures, but in the context of the question, option B is the best answer."

Anticonvulsant medications work by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening, which helps to stabilize the neurons that are firing uncontrollably during a seizure. Option A is incorrect because prolongation of chloride channel opening can actually worsen seizures. Option C is incorrect because blocking calcium channels can actually exacerbate seizures. Option D is incorrect because inactivating sodium channels can help to prevent seizures, but it is not the mechanism of action for the type of anticonvulsant medication given in this scenario."
