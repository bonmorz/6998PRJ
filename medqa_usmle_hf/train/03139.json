This is accomplished by placing a clamp across the vessels which supply the liver including the hepatic artery, portal vein, and bile duct. Clamping these vessels allows for temporary occlusion of the liver blood supply to decrease the risk of hemorrhage during surgical intervention. Clamping the aorta would result in complete cessation of blood flow to the lower extremities and organs, which would cause significant morbidity and mortality. Clamping the hepatic vein would not provide adequate control of bleeding and may lead to fatal complications. Clamping the splenic artery would not provide any protection against liver bleeding. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) hepatoduodenal ligament."
