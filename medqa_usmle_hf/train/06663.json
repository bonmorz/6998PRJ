In chronic alcohol use, thiamine deficiency is common and affects the function of transketolase, leading to neurological symptoms such as impairments in judgement, sequencing tasks, and memory. Methionine synthase deficiency affects the metabolism of folate and vitamin B12, causing megaloblastic anemia and neurological symptoms. Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency impairs glucose metabolism, leading to lactic acidosis. Dopamine-\u00df-hydroxylase deficiency is rare and affects the synthesis of norepinephrine and epinephrine, causing orthostatic hypotension and other autonomic symptoms."

Therefore, the most likely enzyme impaired in this patient is transketolase."

This syndrome is caused by impaired activity of transketolase, which is involved in glucose metabolism in the brain. The patient\u2019s cognitive impairments suggest a neurological consequence of the syndrome. Methionine synthase deficiency causes vitamin B12 deficiency and neurological symptoms, but the symptoms involve sensory and motor functions. Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects energy production and causes neurological symptoms. Dopamine-\u00df-hydroxylase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects production of neurotransmitters and causes orthostatic hypotension and other symptoms that are not consistent with this patient\u2019s presentation."
