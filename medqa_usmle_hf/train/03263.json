The patient\u2019s history of smoking, cough, weight loss, and wheezing over the right lung fields is suggestive of a malignancy. The elevated serum calcium also supports the diagnosis of squamous cell lung carcinoma, as it is known to secrete parathyroid hormone-related protein leading to hypercalcemia. The x-ray shows a mass in the right lung consistent with this diagnosis. Lobar pneumonia would likely present with symptoms such as fever and productive cough. Tuberculosis may present with cough, weight loss, and fever, but wheezing and hypercalcemia are not typical findings. Sarcoidosis may present with cough, but is not typically associated with wheezing or hypercalcemia."
