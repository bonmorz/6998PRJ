A special diet low in phenylalanine and high in large neutral amino acids is needed to prevent intellectual disability and other complications. L-carnitine is not specifically needed for PKU, though it may be helpful in some cases. Thiamine and malate are not relevant to the treatment of PKU."

The symptoms described suggest a diagnosis of phenylketonuria (PKU), where patients have a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase, an enzyme necessary to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine. This leads to accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites, which can cause neurological damage. Treatment involves a special diet low in phenylalanine and supplemented with large neutral amino acids. L-carnitine is used to treat carnitine deficiency. Thiamine is a B-complex vitamin and malate is a salt of malic acid and neither are relevant to PKU."
