The sweet smell on the breath is a sign of ketoacidosis, which occurs due to the breakdown of fatty acids when glucose is not available. HFI is caused by a deficiency in aldolase B. Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase is associated with galactosemia, while Ornithine transcarbamolase deficiency is associated with urea cycle disorders. Glucose is not deficient in HFI, but rather cannot be metabolized properly."

Galactosemia (B) and ornithine transcarbamolase deficiency (D) are other metabolic disorders that can present with similar symptoms, but the sweet smell to the breath is more indicative of aldolase B deficiency. Glucose (C) is not deficient in this patient, as hypoglycemia is a symptom of aldolase B deficiency."

This condition is known as hereditary fructose intolerance.

Glucose is not deficient in this patient as hypoglycemia is present.
