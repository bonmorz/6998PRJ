Option B describes the mechanism of action of both drugs as inhibiting the reuptake of monoamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) at the synapse, which is consistent with the symptoms observed in the patients. Option A is incorrect because Drug B also increases extracellular dopamine. Option C is incorrect because Drug A can also increase the release of monoamine neurotransmitters. Option D is incorrect because both drugs can increase norepinephrine activity."

The symptoms of acute intoxication suggest that both drugs are stimulants, but their mechanisms of action are different. Drug A, or cocaine, predominantly acts by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine at the synapse. Drug B, or amphetamines, predominantly act by increasing the release of these neurotransmitters into the synapse. Option B is the most accurate statement. Option A is false, as Drug A does not just transiently increase the extracellular concentration of dopamine but inhibits its reuptake. Option C is also false, as Drug B increases the release of the neurotransmitters. Option D is partially true, as Drug B can increase norepinephrine activity, but it also affects dopamine and serotonin."
