The patient has sickle cell disease and poorly controlled hypertension, which puts him at risk for renal complications. The presence of periorbital swelling and lower extremity edema suggests nephrotic syndrome secondary to renal disease. Option (D) best fits the description of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which is commonly seen in patients with sickle cell disease and hypertension. Hypercellular glomeruli with neutrophils and subepithelial immune complex deposition are characteristic of post-infectious glomerulonephritis. Increased mesangial cellularity and mesangial immune complex deposition are characteristic of IgA nephropathy. Diffusely thickened capillaries and subepithelial immune complex deposition are characteristic of membranous nephropathy."
