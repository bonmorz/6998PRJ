The patient presents with persistent back pain, recent weight loss, and constipation, as well as elevated calcium levels and elevated creatinine levels, which are suggestive of plasma cell dyscrasia. The cardiovascular exam findings may also suggest an underlying condition such as multiple myeloma. Muscle strain or herniated nucleus pulposus are less likely due to the persistent nature of the pain and lack of exacerbation with certain maneuvers. Piriformis muscle inflammation is also less likely given the absence of symptoms such as buttock pain or sciatica."
