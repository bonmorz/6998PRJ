The patient presents with symptoms of pelvic discomfort and heavy menstrual bleeding, with a firm, irregularly-shaped uterus consistent with a 5-week gestation, but a negative urine pregnancy test. This suggests the presence of uterine fibroids. Pelvic ultrasound is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis to confirm the presence and size of the fibroids. Laparoscopy or pelvic MRI is more invasive and not needed as a first-line diagnostic tool. Repeat \u03b2-HCG test is not indicated as the patient has a negative urine pregnancy test and the symptoms are not consistent with an ectopic pregnancy."
