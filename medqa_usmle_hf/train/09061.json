The symptoms described are classic features of Fragile X syndrome, which is caused by an expansion of the CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene. The number of CGG repeats determines the severity of the syndrome, with more than 200 repeats resulting in a full mutation and severe intellectual disability.

Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy is caused by a repeat expansion of CAG in the androgen receptor gene. However, none of the other diagnoses fit with the symptoms described in the case."
