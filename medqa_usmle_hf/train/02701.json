The symptoms, especially the weaker popliteal pulse and cool and pale right leg, suggest acute limb ischemia, which requires urgent assessment for amputation or revascularization to restore blood flow and prevent limb loss. Decompressive laminectomy is used for spinal cord compression. Oral acetaminophen and topical capsaicin are used for pain relief, but they do not address the underlying issue. Arthroscopic synovectomy is used for joint inflammation."
