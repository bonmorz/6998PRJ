The symptoms and relief from sublingual nitrate suggest that the patient is experiencing angina, likely caused by diffuse esophageal spasm. Therefore, the most likely finding on esophageal manometry would be simultaneous multiphase contractions. Endoscopy would not likely show mucosal erosions, and elevated CK-MB levels would suggest myocardial damage rather than esophageal spasm. Hypertensive contractions are not a typical finding in diffuse esophageal spasm."
