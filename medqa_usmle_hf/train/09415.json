The occasional cocaine use and excessive gym visits are also consistent with anorexia nervosa. Binge-eating disorder would not explain the patient\u2019s underweight or fine hair.

The patient also exhibits signs of guilt and low self-esteem, which are common in patients with Anorexia nervosa. The occasional cocaine use and binge-eating and vomiting behaviors may be comorbid with Anorexia nervosa, but the primary diagnosis should be Anorexia nervosa."
