The patient's symptoms and history of IV heroin abuse put her at high risk for infective endocarditis, which can cause splenomegaly and joint tenderness with restricted range of motion (the so-called Osler nodes). This condition can also cause a mild to moderate leukocytosis with left-shift, but it is unlikely to cause a decreased anion gap or positive HIV serology. Neutropenia is not a typical finding in infective endocarditis. Therefore, the correct answer is (B), leukocytosis with left-shift."

Leukocytosis with left-shift is also possible, but neutropenia is a more specific finding. HIV serology may be tested, but it is not the most likely abnormality to be found in this case. A decreased anion gap is not typical in this situation."
