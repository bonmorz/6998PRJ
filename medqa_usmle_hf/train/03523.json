The fact that clenching the fist increases the intensity of the murmur suggests that it is related to changes in pressure in the heart. The most likely cause of this is a defect in the ventricular septum, which would cause a left-to-right shunt and increase blood flow through the pulmonary valve, leading to the murmur. Fusion of the right and left coronary leaflets would not cause a murmur. A defect in the atrial septum would cause a right-to-left shunt and potentially lead to a murmur, but it would not increase in intensity with fist clenching. Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close would not cause a murmur in this location."

The fact that the intensity of the murmur increases when the patient clenches her fist suggests that it is related to increased afterload on the left ventricle. This is a characteristic of a ventricular septal defect (VSD), as it allows blood to flow from the high-pressure left ventricle to the lower-pressure right ventricle. Fusion of the right and left coronary leaflets is a cause of aortic stenosis, which would not be affected by fist clenching. Defects in the atrial septum would not cause a murmur. Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close leads to a patent ductus arteriosus, which would also not be affected by fist clenching."
