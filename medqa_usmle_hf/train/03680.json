However, given the severity of the symptoms, including the high fever and hypotension, this patient likely has a complicated PID with potential abscess formation or ruptured infection. Therefore, exploratory laparotomy is the most appropriate definitive treatment. Antibiotics can be started empirically with a combination of levofloxacin and metronidazole, but this would only be a temporizing measure until definitive treatment can be provided. Single-dose ceftriaxone IM and clindamycin + gentamicin \u00d7 14 days are not appropriate for a patient with a complicated PID."
