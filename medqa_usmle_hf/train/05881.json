The decreased range of motion and discomfort with neck flexion also support this diagnosis. Basic labs and urine sample are ordered, but definitive diagnosis and treatment require lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Therefore, the best next step is to administer antibiotics and steroids to cover the likely bacterial causes of meningitis, pending diagnosis. Options A and B include antibiotics but not steroids, which are important for reducing inflammation and improving outcomes in bacterial meningitis. Option D may be useful for identifying any intracranial abnormalities but does not address the immediate need for treatment."
