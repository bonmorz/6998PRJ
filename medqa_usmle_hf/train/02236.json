Although the express troponin test was negative, it may take 3-6 hours for troponin to become positive following an acute coronary syndrome event. Exercise stress testing can help to confirm the diagnosis by inducing the symptoms and ECG changes. Blood test for CPK-MB and chest radiography are not specific for coronary artery disease, and CT angiography may be useful in some cases but is not the first-line recommendation in this scenario."
