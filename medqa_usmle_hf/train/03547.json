Positive serum ASO titer is associated with streptococcal infections, such as rheumatic fever, but this is not the most likely cause of joint inflammation in this patient. Radiographs would show osteopenia and joint space narrowing in chronic joint conditions such as osteoarthritis but are not specific to this acute presentation."

The presence of purulent joint effusion with negative culture is the most likely finding, as the causative organism may take time to grow in culture. Gram-positive cocci in clusters would suggest Staphylococcus aureus, but this is not a guaranteed finding. A positive serum ASO titer would suggest recent Streptococcal infection but is not relevant in this case. Radiographs showing osteopenia and joint space narrowing would suggest chronic arthritis, which is not likely in this case as the symptoms are only present for 2 days."
