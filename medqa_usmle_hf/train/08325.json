Minimal change disease also causes nephrotic syndrome but is more common in children.

The biopsy shows focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which is characterized by scarring in some glomeruli of the kidney. The patient presents with frothy urine, swelling of the body, and significant proteinuria, which are all consistent with FSGS. The fact that the patient has HIV and is being treated with antiretroviral therapy is relevant because HIV-associated nephropathy can also cause FSGS. Minimal change disease typically has much less proteinuria, while diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis would have different biopsy findings."
