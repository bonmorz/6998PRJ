The patient presents with signs and symptoms of meningitis (fever, poor feeding, lethargy, bulging fontanelle, and tensing of extensor muscles), which is a medical emergency. The most common causes of meningitis in neonates are Group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes, and the best initial therapy is a combination of ampicillin (which covers Listeria) and aminoglycoside antibiotics such as gentamicin (which covers Group B Streptococcus and E. coli). Therefore, option (A) is the most appropriate choice."
