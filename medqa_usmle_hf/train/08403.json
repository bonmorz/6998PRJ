The rash on the left calf with distinct borders indicates erythema migrans, a characteristic sign of Lyme disease, which is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Pain in lower limb muscles and joints may be due to Lyme arthritis, which occurs at an advanced stage of the disease. Starting doxycycline therapy is the next best step in the management, as it is the first-line treatment for Lyme disease. Serological testing, such as enzyme immunoassay or western blot, can confirm the diagnosis but may take time to show positivity. Blood culture is not helpful in diagnosing Lyme disease as the bacteria are difficult to culture. Asking the patient to come back after one week may delay the treatment and progression of the disease."

The rash and symptoms in the lower limb muscles and joints suggest Lyme disease, which is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi transmitted through tick bites.

Blood culture is not indicated for Lyme disease.

Starting doxycycline therapy is the best next step as it is the first-line treatment for early Lyme disease.
