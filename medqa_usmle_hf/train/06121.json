The patient has a history of IV drug use, jaundice, and positive hepatitis C antibody, suggesting a possible viral hepatitis infection. The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is to perform a PCR for viral RNA to confirm the presence of viral hepatitis C. Western blot for HIV is unnecessary, as there are no clinical or laboratory findings that suggest HIV infection, and the patient is already positive for hepatitis C. PCR for viral DNA is not as sensitive as PCR for viral RNA in diagnosing hepatitis C. Liver biopsy may be needed for staging and to assess for fibrosis or cirrhosis, but it is not a first-line test for diagnosis."
