The patient's laboratory results suggest spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which is a serious complication in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. The next step in management should be prompt initiation of empirical antibiotic therapy such as intravenous cefotaxime. Surgical consultation may be necessary if there are signs of perforation or obstruction, but it is not the next, best step in this case. Serum lipase level and abdominal radiography/contrast CT are not necessary for the management of SBP."
