The fact that the placenta was manually separated and the patient has a nontender uterine fundus suggest that the uterus is contracting well. Hemoglobin and platelet count are normal, so consumption of intravascular clotting factors is unlikely. Uterine rupture would have caused pain and probably palpable fetal parts. Defective decidual layer of the placenta is the most likely cause of postpartum bleeding in this patient."

Option A (impaired uterine contractions) and option B (consumption of intravascular clotting factors) are both possible causes of postpartum bleeding, but they are less likely in this case given the firm, nontender uterine fundus and normal coagulation studies. Option C (rupture of the uterine wall) is a rare but serious complication of labor, but there is no indication for it in this case."

The fact that manual separation of the placenta leads to profuse vaginal bleeding suggests that the placenta is abnormally attached to the uterine wall, which is known as placenta accreta. This condition is often seen in women who have had multiple Cesarean deliveries. The defective decidual layer of the placenta is the most likely underlying mechanism in this patient's postpartum bleeding. Impaired uterine contractions can cause postpartum hemorrhage, but in this case, the uterine fundus is firm and nontender, suggesting normal uterine activity. Consumption of intravascular clotting factors can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation, but in this case, the activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time are within normal limits. Rupture of the uterine wall is a rare cause of postpartum hemorrhage and is usually associated with a history of uterine surgery or trauma."
