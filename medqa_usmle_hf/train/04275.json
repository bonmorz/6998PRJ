The fact that the patient has lost sensation on one side of his body but not motor strength suggests that it is likely an injury to a blood vessel supplying the spinal cord rather than a dorsal root or corticospinal tract. The most likely option is the posterior spinal artery, which supplies the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway responsible for vibration and proprioception. The injury may also affect the descending tracts, causing a loss of temperature and pain sensation. The artery of Adamkiewicz usually supplies the lower lumbar and sacral segment of the spinal cord and would result in a different pattern of sensory and motor deficits."
