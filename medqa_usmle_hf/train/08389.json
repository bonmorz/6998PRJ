The patient\u2019s history of previous postexposure prophylaxis for rabies is reassuring, but given the unprovoked raccoon bite, the most appropriate next step would be to administer a rabies vaccination. No action needed is not the correct answer as bites from animals can lead to infections. While a tetanus booster may be needed, it is not the most appropriate next step in management. Rabies immunoglobulin and vaccine may be needed if there was confirmed rabies in the raccoon or if there is any doubt about the raccoon being rabies-free."

Choice C is not needed since he received a tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine at the age of 16, and the current wound does not require a tetanus booster."
