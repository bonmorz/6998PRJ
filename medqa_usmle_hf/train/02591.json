The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a medical emergency. Plasma exchange therapy is the most effective intervention for TTP, as it removes autoantibodies and replaces the deficient enzyme ADAMTS13. Transfusion of packed red blood cells may be necessary but does not address the underlying issue. Platelet transfusion is contraindicated in TTP as it may worsen the thrombosis. Intravenous tranexamic acid may help in some bleeding disorders, but it is not appropriate in this case as the patient has a thrombotic disorder."
