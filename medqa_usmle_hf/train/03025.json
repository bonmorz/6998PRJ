The patient's alcoholism puts him at risk for malnutrition, and the palpitations and prolonged QT interval suggest hypomagnesemia. Magnesium is an important electrolyte for cardiac function, and deficiency can cause arrhythmias and muscle weakness. Potassium deficiency can also cause muscle weakness but usually does not cause palpitations. Folate deficiency usually manifests as anemia and does not cause palpitations or prolonged QT interval. Vitamin D deficiency can cause bone and muscle weakness but does not cause palpitations or prolonged QT interval."

The patient's symptoms are consistent with alcoholic malnutrition, which can lead to magnesium deficiency, as well as other vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Magnesium deficiency can cause weakness, palpitations, brisk DTRs, and a prolonged QT interval on EKG. Potassium deficiency can also lead to QT prolongation, but it is less likely to be the primary cause in this case. Folate and Vitamin D deficiencies are also possible in alcoholics, but are less likely to contribute to these specific findings."
