The medication prescribed is most likely a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) that inhibits thrombin, such as dabigatran. Idarucizumab is a reversal agent for dabigatran, and can be used in case of bleeding or emergency surgery. Option A refers to antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and clopidogrel, option B refers to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors used for acute coronary syndromes, and option C refers to factor Xa inhibitors such as apixaban and rivaroxaban."

The presentation of palpitations and shortness of breath along with the ECG finding of narrow-complex tachycardia without P waves suggests atrial fibrillation. The prophylactic medication most likely prescribed is a direct thrombin inhibitor, such as dabigatran, which can be reversed with idarucizumab. Thrombocyte phosphodiesterase III inhibitors, such as clopidogrel, and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, such as abciximab, are used to prevent platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Direct factor Xa inhibitors, such as rivaroxaban, would not be appropriate for this patient with atrial fibrillation."
