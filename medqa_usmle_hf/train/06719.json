The patient has a positive reaction to PPD placement and works at a county prison, which puts him at an increased risk for tuberculosis. Rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol are used for the intensive phase of treatment, while isoniazid is used for the continuation phase. Since the patient has diabetes, which is a risk factor for progression to active tuberculosis, and has a larger bleb size, a longer duration of isoniazid treatment (9 months) is recommended."
