Insensitivity to activated protein C and an elevated D-dimer suggest a hypercoagulable state. Among the options, a mutation of coagulation factor V is most likely to cause this hypercoagulable state. Antiphospholipid antibodies can also lead to DVT, but the patient does not have a history of systemic lupus erythematosus. Elevated levels of homocysteine and deficiency of protein C are less likely based on the given information. Further testing may include genetic testing for mutations on the factor V gene."

The insensitivity to activated protein C and elevated D-dimer levels suggest a hypercoagulable state. The most likely cause in this case is a mutation of coagulation factor V (also known as Factor V Leiden), which is a genetic predisposition to thrombosis. Antiphospholipid antibodies and deficiencies of protein C are also possible causes of a hypercoagulable state, but they are less likely in this specific case. Elevated levels of homocysteine, a precursor to methionine, may increase the risk of thrombosis, but it is not a direct cause of hypercoagulability."

The patient\u2019s history of a previous pulmonary embolism and insensitivity to activated protein C suggests that the most likely cause of her current symptoms is a recurrent blood clot. The question also provides information about her family history and other laboratory studies, indicating that a genetic mutation of coagulation factor V, known as factor V Leiden, may be the cause. Therefore, further examination is most likely to show a mutation of coagulation factor V. Antiphospholipid antibodies may be seen in patients with lupus and can increase the risk of blood clots, but this is not suggested by the patient\u2019s history or physical examination. Elevated levels of homocysteine or a deficiency of protein C can also increase the risk of blood clots, but these are not the most likely causes given the patient\u2019s history and laboratory studies."
