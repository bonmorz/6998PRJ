The patient\u2019s history of atopic dermatitis, hay fever, and symptoms suggest that the most likely cause of his symptoms is Type I hypersensitivity, also known as allergic asthma. Exercise-induced asthma is a possibility, but the presence of symptoms during light walks and at rest suggest more than exercise induced bronchoconstriction. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is unlikely as the patient is only 28 years old and has no history of smoking."
