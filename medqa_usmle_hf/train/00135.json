The sample size of the study affects the precision of the estimate of the true effect size, which is reflected in the width of the confidence interval. With a smaller sample size of 7,000 participants, the confidence interval range is expected to be wider, resulting in decreased precision, and increased likelihood of a type II error (failing to detect a true difference). Neither the hazard ratio nor the type I error rate is expected to be affected by the sample size. The risk of confounding bias is not related to sample size."
