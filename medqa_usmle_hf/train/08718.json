Warfarin is another option for anticoagulation. Immediate DC cardioversion is an option for hemodynamically unstable patients, but not for stable patients like this case.

Cardioversion should be delayed for 3-4 weeks to allow adequate anticoagulation. Warfarin also requires bridging and frequent monitoring of INR. Diltiazem can control the heart rate but does not prevent thromboembolic events. Catheter ablation is a potential option for rhythm control, but not as an initial therapy."

Warfarin can also be used instead of rivaroxaban, but its use requires more monitoring and adjustment. Direct current cardioversion may be necessary but should not be performed until the patient has been anticoagulated for at least 3-4 weeks.

Catheter ablation is a consideration for rhythm control, but the patient's reduced ejection fraction suggests the need for medical management first."
