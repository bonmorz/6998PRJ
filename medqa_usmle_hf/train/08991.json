Colposcopy with endocervical sampling would be appropriate if the Pap smear showed high-grade dysplasia or if there were abnormalities in the pelvic exam or patient's history. Endometrial sampling is not necessary in this case since the patient has no abnormal findings on pelvic exam. Repeat Pap smear in 3 years is not appropriate for management of LSIL."
