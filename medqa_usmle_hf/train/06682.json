The combination of shortness of breath, cough, and swelling in the legs and abdomen suggests a possible diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with cor pulmonale, which is a complication of COPD that causes right heart failure. The most likely process leading to this complication is defective protein folding, which can lead to the buildup of misfolded proteins in the body and cause damage to organs such as the heart and kidneys. Damage to kidney tubules could lead to renal failure and swelling, excessive protease activity could lead to lung damage, and hyperplasia of mucous glands could lead to airway obstruction, but none of these processes are as closely linked to cor pulmonale as defective protein folding."

Defective protein folding can lead to conditions such as amyloidosis or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which can cause pulmonary hypertension and fluid accumulation. Damage to kidney tubules would lead to renal failure and upper body fluid accumulation. Excessive protease activity would lead to emphysema, but not fluid accumulation.
