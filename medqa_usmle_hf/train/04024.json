The presentation of painless rectal bleeding and an uncomfortable lump suggest internal hemorrhoids, and the enlarged blood vessels seen on anoscopy support this diagnosis. The bleeding is described as intermittent and not associated with the passage of stool, which is typical of internal hemorrhoids above the pectinate line. The grading system for internal hemorrhoids is different from that for external hemorrhoids, and grade 2 internal hemorrhoids are defined as protruding hemorrhoids that require manual reduction. Neither the external hemorrhoids nor the grade 1 category involves internal protrusion, and grade 3 external hemorrhoids are defined as prolapsing hemorrhoids that require manual reduction."
