The information given does not suggest any serious mental or physical condition that requires immediate medical intervention. Therefore, reassurance of the mother and observation of the child's behavior may be appropriate at this point. It is important to understand that talking to imaginary friends is a normal and common part of childhood development. However, if the behavior persists or becomes disruptive, a consultation with a child psychiatrist may be necessary. Child Protective Services do not need to be involved at this time, as there is no indication of abuse or neglect. An MRI of the brain is not necessary based on the information provided."

MRI of the brain and informing Child Protective Services are not indicated in this case as there are no findings to suggest a need for these interventions.
