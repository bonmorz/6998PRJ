The patient's BMI of 17, dry mucous membranes, and calluses on the dorsum of her right hand indicate an eating disorder. The fact that she reports no complaints and has a history of sexual abuse in her teens narrows down the differential diagnosis to anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. However, the absence of purging behaviors such as vomiting or laxative use makes anorexia nervosa - restrictive type less likely. The presence of dental carries suggests that the patient may be inducing vomiting or abusing laxatives, indicating bulimia nervosa - purging type. Therefore, (B) is the most likely diagnosis."

The calluses on the dorsum of her right hand suggest bulimia nervosa, which involves repeated episodes of binge eating followed by purging behaviors such as self-induced vomiting or laxative use. The patient's dry mucous membranes and dental carries also suggest bulimia nervosa. The absence of purging behaviors in the answer options makes (A) and (D) unlikely.

The patient's history of sexual abuse may also suggest a higher likelihood of purging-type anorexia nervosa. The diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder is not supported by the given information."
