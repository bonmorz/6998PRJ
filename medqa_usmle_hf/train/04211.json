Short intramural ureter segment could cause hydronephrosis, but there is no evidence of dilation of the renal pelvis in the ultrasound image. Posterior urethral valves are a congenital anomaly and are unlikely to present in an 87-year-old patient. Formation of renal parenchymal cysts would not cause compression of the renal cortex and medulla."
