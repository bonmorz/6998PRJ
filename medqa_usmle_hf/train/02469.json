The loose, easily removable vegetations composed of fibrin and mononuclear cells suggest non-infectious endocarditis, which is often caused by procoagulant release in the setting of advanced malignancy. Dystrophic calcifications usually indicate long-standing fibrosis, bacterial colonization would show more inflammation, and metastatic infiltration would be indicated by cancer cells found in the tissue."

The vegetations described are consistent with non-infectious endocarditis, also known as Libman-Sacks endocarditis, which is most commonly seen in patients with autoimmune diseases such as lupus. The underlying pathology is thought to be due to procoagulant release and subsequent thrombus formation on the valves. Dystrophic calcifications and metastatic infiltration are not consistent with the described findings, and while bacterial colonization can cause endocarditis, the absence of bacterial organisms on examination suggests a non-infectious cause."
