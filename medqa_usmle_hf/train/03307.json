Glucagon is a hormone that functions to increase blood glucose levels and promote lipid breakdown, which is known as lipolysis. It does this by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose, and promoting gluconeogenesis. It also promotes lipolysis, leading to the release of fatty acids from adipose tissue. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Increased lipolysis. Option (A) is incorrect because glucagon inhibits insulin release. Option (B) is incorrect because glucagon promotes the breakdown of glucose, not glycolysis. Option (D) is incorrect because glucagon actually promotes the production of ketone bodies."
