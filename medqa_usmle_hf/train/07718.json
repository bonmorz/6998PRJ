The patient has a history of hip replacement surgery and subsequent swelling in his right calf, indicating a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The symptoms of shortness of breath, left-sided chest pain, and the finding of a partial intraluminal filling defect on CTPA suggest a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). The mechanism of PE is trapped thrombus in the pulmonary vasculature, which can result from a DVT breaking off and traveling to the lungs. Inflammation of the lung parenchyma would be seen in pneumonia, occluding thrombus in a coronary artery would cause a heart attack, and accumulation of fluids in the pericardial sac would lead to cardiac tamponade.
