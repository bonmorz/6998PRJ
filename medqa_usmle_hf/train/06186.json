The patient exhibits many signs of inflammatory breast cancer, including breast enlargement, thickened skin, erythema, and tenderness, as well as an ulcer and nipple discharge.

Lobular carcinoma in situ typically does not present with skin changes or lymph node involvement. Infiltrating ductal and lobular carcinoma can both cause skin changes and lymph node involvement, but the rapid onset and severity of symptoms suggest inflammatory breast cancer."

The patient's symptoms, including painful ulceration, discharge, thickened skin, erythema, edema, and adenopathy, are consistent with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). The presence of a mass with calcifications, parenchymal distortion, and dermal lymphatic invasion are also supporting factors for an IBC diagnosis. LCIS typically does not present with palpable masses or skin changes, and is usually an incidental finding on mammography or biopsy. Infiltrating lobular carcinoma (ILC) is less likely to cause skin changes and inflammatory symptoms, and is typically detected on imaging or physical examination as a subtle thickening or subtle mass. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) can also present with skin changes and inflammatory symptoms, but these are less common than in IBC. However, without additional information about the pathology and imaging findings, it is possible that ILC or IDC could also be present."
