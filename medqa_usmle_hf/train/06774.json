The history of the mother being an immigrant from Guatemala and the diffuse purpuric rash are suggestive of congenital rubella. The machine-like murmur may suggest the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus, which is a common finding in infants with congenital rubella syndrome. The fact that the mother was not screened for group B strep and received penicillin prior to delivery suggests that early onset group B streptococcus sepsis is less likely. Syphilis and cytomegalovirus can also cause similar symptoms but are less likely based on the given information."
