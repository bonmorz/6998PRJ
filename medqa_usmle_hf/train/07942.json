The decreased ABI in the right leg indicates significant stenosis or occlusion of the right femoral artery. Patients with peripheral artery disease have a higher risk of cardiovascular events, such as acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, the correct answer is (D). Limb amputation may be necessary in cases of severe peripheral artery disease, but it is not the most immediate risk in this patient's case. Lower extremity lymphedema is not a common complication of peripheral artery disease, and acute mesenteric ischemia is not directly related to the patient's symptoms."
