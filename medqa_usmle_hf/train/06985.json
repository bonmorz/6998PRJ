HIV testing typically involves an initial screening test that is qualitative, meaning it detects the presence or absence of HIV antibodies or antigens in the blood. If the screening test is positive, a confirmatory test is performed. Therefore, option (B) is correct. Option (A) is incorrect as HIV screening tests are not quantitative. Option (C) and (D) describe antigen/antibody binding mechanisms that are not applicable to the current question."
