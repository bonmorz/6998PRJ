The right lower leg swelling, erythema, and tenderness suggest a deep vein thrombosis, which can travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism. The travel history also raises suspicion for a possible clotting disorder. Patent foramen ovale is a known risk factor for paradoxical embolism and should be evaluated in this patient. Ventricular septal defect, carotid artery dissection, and atrial fibrillation are not as likely to cause this presentation."

The patient presents with weakness on the left side and a swollen, tender, and erythematous right lower leg, which suggests a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Obese patients and those taking oral contraceptives are at higher risk for DVT. In addition, the patient travels frequently, which further increases her risk. A DVT can lead to a pulmonary embolism, which is a potential cause of the patient\u2019s weakness. Patent foramen ovale is a cardiac defect that can predispose to paradoxical embolism and is not related to the patient\u2019s presentation. Ventricular septal defect and atrial fibrillation are also unlikely causes for her symptoms. Carotid artery dissection can cause stroke-like symptoms, but the patient\u2019s presentation is not consistent with this diagnosis."
