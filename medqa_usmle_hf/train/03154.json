The MRI shows a large mass in the right frontal lobe, indicating a likely malignant tumor such as a glioblastoma multiforme. Surgical resection is the most appropriate next step in management to remove as much of the tumor as possible and improve symptoms. Stereotactic brain biopsy is usually used to diagnose brain tumors, but since the MRI suggests a malignant tumor, a biopsy is not needed before surgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery is usually used for small tumors or for patients who are not good candidates for surgery. Intrathecal methotrexate therapy is used in the treatment of certain leukemia and lymphoma but is not appropriate for a brain tumor like glioblastoma multiforme."
