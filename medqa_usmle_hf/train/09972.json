The fact that several other children at the patient's preschool have been sick with similar symptoms supports this hypothesis. The new dog may or may not be related to the illness, but there is no obvious mechanism by which it could cause high fever, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. Similarly, a recent antibiotic prescription would not explain the symptoms. Failure to appropriately immunize the patient is also unlikely to be the cause, as the symptoms are not consistent with any vaccine-preventable diseases."
