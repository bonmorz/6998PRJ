The most appropriate way to begin the interview with the patient's wife is to ask about her understanding of her husband's current condition. This allows the physician to gauge how much the wife already knows and to clarify any misunderstandings. It also helps the physician to understand the patient's preferences for information sharing and to avoid causing undue distress. Option B may be appropriate later in the conversation, but it is not the best way to begin the interview. Option C is not appropriate because the patient has already received aggressive chemotherapy and further chemotherapy may not be a viable option. Option D is not appropriate because it is too direct and could cause significant distress for the wife."
