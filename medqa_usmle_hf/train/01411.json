The patient's history of smoking, alcohol consumption, and anabolic steroid use increase the risk of lung cancer, which can cause apical tumors that can compress nerves and blood vessels leading to weakness and sensory changes in the arm. The symptoms of dull aching and burning pain in the arm also suggest a neurological cause, rather than cerebral infarction, which would present with more acute symptoms such as sudden onset of weakness and numbness. Scalenus anticus syndrome would also present with similar symptoms but is less common than apical lung tumors, and the patient has a higher risk for lung cancer due to his history. Subclavian steal syndrome would present with symptoms in the arm but not necessarily with weakness, and the patient has a higher likelihood of an apical lung tumor given his history."
