The presentation and history suggest syphilis, and the gram-negative, spiral-shaped bacteria indicates Treponema pallidum.

Option B (Aminoacyl-tRNA binding) is targeted by tetracyclines, which can also be used to treat syphilis, but penicillin is preferred as the first-line treatment. Options C and D are targeted by sulfonamides and trimethoprim, respectively, which are not effective against syphilis."
