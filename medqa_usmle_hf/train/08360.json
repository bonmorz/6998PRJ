The patient\u2019s drastically restricted diet led to hypoglycemia, which is being compensated with an increased glycogenolysis rate. Option A is incorrect because increased insulin secretion would lead to hyperglycemia rather than hypoglycemia in this situation. Option C is incorrect because epinephrine-induced gluconeogenesis is not the main process that compensates for hypoglycemia in this situation, although epinephrine may play a role. Option D is incorrect because hypoglycemia actually stimulates glucagon release from pancreatic alpha cells."
