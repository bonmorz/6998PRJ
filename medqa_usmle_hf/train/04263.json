DNA polymerase I is responsible for removing these RNA primers, and its 5' to 3' exonuclease activity is responsible for this. Therefore, decreasing this activity of DNA polymerase I would prevent the removal of the RNA primers on the lagging strand. All other options do not directly affect the removal of RNA primers. Helicase separates the DNA strands, DNA polymerase I 3' to 5' exonuclease activity is involved in proofreading and correcting errors, and DNA ligase joins the fragments of DNA on the lagging strand."
