This is a viral infection of the brain, and acyclovir is the appropriate antiviral medication to treat it. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is used for ischemic stroke, not herpes encephalitis. Ceftriaxone and vancomycin are used for bacterial meningitis, which typically presents with fever, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status, but the MRI does not support this diagnosis. Amphotericin B is used for fungal infections, which are not suggested by the clinical presentation or MRI findings."
