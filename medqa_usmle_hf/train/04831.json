The hyperdense mass seen on noncontrast head CT and the homogeneous, well-circumscribed mass with compression of adjacent white matter on MRI, along with the patient's age and medical history, suggest the most likely diagnosis is a meningioma. Glioblastoma multiforme often has irregular borders and central necrosis, and Schwannoma and Hemangioblastoma are less common than meningioma."
