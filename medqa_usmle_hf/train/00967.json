The patient has symptoms of depression, including fatigue, difficulty focusing, and a flat affect, but does not have evidence of suicidal ideation or psychosis. Escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is a first-line treatment for depression. Reassurance alone is not sufficient treatment for depression. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine used for anxiety and should not be used as the first-line treatment for depression. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant and is not typically used as a first-line treatment due to side effects and potential for overdose."
