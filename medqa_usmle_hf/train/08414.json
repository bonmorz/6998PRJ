The symptoms and the family history suggest the patient has pheochromocytoma, and the elevated urine metanephrines confirm the diagnosis. Phenoxybenzamine is the recommended first-line medication for pheochromocytoma as it blocks alpha receptors and prevents a hypertensive crisis. Propranolol and atenolol are beta blockers, which may exacerbate hypertension caused by pheochromocytoma. Phentolamine is also an alpha blocker, but it has a shorter duration of action compared to phenoxybenzamine."
