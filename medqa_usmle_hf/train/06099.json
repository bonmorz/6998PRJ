The child exhibits several behaviors commonly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including difficulty with social interaction, repetitive behaviors, and obsessive interests. The fact that he has always been a lonely kid and the symptoms have been present for a while also support the diagnosis of ASD. The other options, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette\u2019s syndrome, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), have some overlapping symptoms with ASD, but specific features of the case (e.g. the barking noises, obsession with rocks) suggest ASD as the most likely diagnosis."

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is possible but doesn't explain the patient's obsession with rocks.
