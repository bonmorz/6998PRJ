The patient\u2019s blood pressure, palpable breast tissue, and small testicles suggest the most likely diagnosis of hypertension due to anabolic steroid use. Anabolic steroids are known to suppress the body\u2019s natural testosterone production, which will decrease gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Thus, the correct answer is (B). Decreased bone density, increased HDL, and increased sperm count are not typical laboratory changes associated with anabolic steroid use."

Option (A) is associated with osteoporosis, which is not a typical finding in this patient. Option (C) may be increased due to the patient\u2019s exercise regimen, but it is not directly related to anabolic steroid use.

Therefore, the laboratory change most likely to be found in this patient is decreased GnRH. Decreased bone density can be seen in conditions such as osteoporosis, increased HDL is more commonly associated with exercise, and small testicles do not necessarily suggest increased sperm count."
