It does not cross the suture lines, is nonpulsatile, and can occur after vacuum-assisted delivery, which fits the presentation of the patient. A lipoma is a benign fatty mass that is not typically present at birth. A subgaleal hemorrhage is a collection of blood within the subgaleal space, which is beneath the galea aponeurotica, and is typically a result of head trauma. An epidermoid cyst is a slow-growing cyst that is typically asymptomatic and is caused by epidermal cells that are trapped during embryonic development."
