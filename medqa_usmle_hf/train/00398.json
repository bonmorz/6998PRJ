Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic that blocks dopamine receptors, but it does not adequately address anxiety symptoms. 5-HT2A receptor antagonism is a mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotics, which have been shown to be effective in treating anxiety symptoms in patients with psychosis. Therefore, a drug with 5-HT2A receptor antagonism should have been prescribed instead of haloperidol to reduce the likelihood of the patient developing her current symptoms."

Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic, which works by blocking dopamine receptors. It can cause restlessness as a side effect. Antipsychotic medications that work by blocking 5-HT2A receptors, such as atypical antipsychotics, are less likely to cause extrapyramidal symptoms like restlessness and have a better side effect profile. Therefore, the drug with 5-HT2A receptor antagonism would have been a better choice to reduce the likelihood of the patient developing her current symptoms."

Haloperidol, which the patient is currently taking, is a dopamine receptor antagonist used to treat psychotic symptoms but may not be as effective in addressing anxiety and restlessness. GABA receptor antagonists are not helpful in addressing anxiety, and \u03b12 receptor antagonists can worsen anxiety symptoms. NMDA receptor antagonists are used to treat other conditions such as depression and can have side effects such as hallucinations and confusion."
