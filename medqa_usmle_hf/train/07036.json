The abnormal blood gases suggest respiratory failure, and intubation is the next best step to secure the airway, provide ventilation support, and improve oxygenation. IV steroids are already being given as prednisone, and terbutaline is not the best choice for severe acute asthma exacerbation. Continuing current management with close observation may lead to deterioration and increased risk of respiratory arrest."

The patient is presenting with severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia despite maximal medical management, which suggests impending respiratory failure.

Option (A) is not appropriate as the patient's current management is not effectively improving his condition. Option (B) may be considered later, but the patient requires immediate airway management. Option (C) may exacerbate the patient's tachycardia and hypertension, therefore, it is not recommended as the next step."

The patient is presenting with severe asthma exacerbation and is not responding well to initial management with standard therapies.

Given the severity of the patient's symptoms, intubation should be considered as the next best step to ensure proper oxygenation and improve respiratory distress. Option (A) is not ideal as the current management is not resulting in significant improvement. Option (B) may be necessary, but in the acute setting, immediate respiratory support should be the primary focus.

The patient is presenting with a severe asthma exacerbation, as evidenced by his shortness of breath with minimal improvement even after using his albuterol inhaler, and his low oxygen saturation despite supplemental oxygen. His normal laboratory values suggest that he does not currently have an infection or other underlying medical condition contributing to his symptoms. His initial management with albuterol nebulizer, magnesium sulfate, and tiotropium bromide did not significantly improve his oxygen saturation or pulse rate. Therefore, the next best step in management would be intubation to provide mechanical ventilation and improve oxygenation. Option A, continuing current management with close observation, would not be appropriate given the severity of the patient's symptoms and lack of improvement with initial interventions. Option B, beginning IV steroids, would be a reasonable option for a patient with an asthma exacerbation, but it would not be sufficient on its own to manage this patient's severe respiratory distress. Option C, terbutaline, is another medication that may be used to treat asthma, but it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for severe exacerbations and would not be appropriate in this case."
