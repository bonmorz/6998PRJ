The symptoms and physical examination suggest a possible diagnosis of meningitis, and the next best step in management is to perform a CT scan of the brain to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a stroke or intracranial bleeding. A lumbar puncture would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of meningitis, but it should not be performed until a CT scan has ruled out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms. Intensive care unit referral may be necessary depending on the severity of the patient's condition, but it is not the next best step in management. Electroencephalography is not typically used in the diagnosis or management of meningitis."
