The child's symptoms suggest an atrial septal defect, which is a congenital heart defect where there is a hole in the wall between the two upper chambers of the heart, causing increased blood flow to the lungs and potentially leading to symptoms such as rapid breathing and mild edema. The presence of a fixed split S2 on inspiration also supports this diagnosis. Liver failure would present with other symptoms such as jaundice and altered mental status. Patent foramen ovale is a normal opening in the heart that usually closes after birth and is unlikely to cause these symptoms. Endocardial cushion syndrome is a rare congenital heart defect that usually presents with more severe symptoms at a younger age, such as heart failure and cyanosis."
