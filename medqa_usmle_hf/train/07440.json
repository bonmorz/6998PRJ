The question is asking for the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test, which is the proportion of patients with a positive test result who actually have the disease. In this case, the patients with a diagnosis of active TB on the basis of history, clinical symptoms, and CXR pattern are the true positives, which is 700 out of the total 2,800 patients with likely active TB. So the PPV is 700/1,000, which equals 0.7, or 70%. However, the question is asking for the probability, which is a percentage. To convert this value to a percentage, multiply it by 100. So the answer is (C) 70%. However, this is not one of the answer choices, likely due to a typographical error. Alternatively, we can use the formula for PPV, which is true positives / (true positives + false positives). In this case, it is 700 / (700 + 300) = 0.7, or 70%. Again, this value needs to be converted to a percentage to match the answer choices."

From the table, we know that there are 700 true positives and 300 false positives in the group with a diagnosis of active TB based on history, symptoms, and CXR. Thus, PPV = 700 / (700 + 300) = 0.7 or 70%. However, the question is asking for the probability that a patient with a diagnosis of active TB based on history, symptoms, and CXR actually has active TB, which is the true positive rate or sensitivity. From the table, we know that out of the total 1000 patients with active TB, only 700 tested positive for TB sputum. Therefore, the sensitivity = true positives / (true positives + false negatives) = 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%. This corresponds to answer choice (B)."

The probability of having active TB given a positive diagnosis is calculated as (true positives) / (true positives + false positives) = 700 / (700 + 300) = 0.70.
