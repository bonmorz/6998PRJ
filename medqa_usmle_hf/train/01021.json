Prominent occiput, long philtrum, and cleft palate are physical findings associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, but they are not relevant to the patient's current symptoms. In this case, the most likely missed physical exam finding is a webbed neck, which is a sign of Turner syndrome, a condition that can be associated with hypertension in girls. It is important to perform a complete physical examination to identify any unusual findings or clues to the underlying diagnosis."

The clicking sound around the time of systole suggests a possible cardiac abnormality, but the absent pedal pulses indicates a possible coarctation of the aorta, which is often missed on physical exam. Among the options, webbed neck is the only one associated with coarctation of the aorta. Cleft palate, prominent occiput, and long philtrum are associated with genetic syndromes such as Down Syndrome but are not likely to be missed during physical exam."
