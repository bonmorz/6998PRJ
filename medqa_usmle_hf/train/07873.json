The child\u2019s symptoms suggest a possible hearing impairment, which can cause delays in speech and social interaction. A hearing exam should be the first step in management to rule out this possibility. While autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a possibility, it cannot be definitively diagnosed without further evaluation. Restructuring the home environment and starting medication (risperidone) should only be considered after a thorough evaluation and diagnosis of ASD or other developmental disorders."
