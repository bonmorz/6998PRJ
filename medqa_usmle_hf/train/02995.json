It can be caused by a variety of factors including genetic disorders (such as 22q.11.2 deletion syndrome and Bruton tyrosine kinase defect), infections (such as Diphyllobothrium latum), radiation exposure, and certain medications. Glanzmann-Riniker syndrome, on the other hand, is a rare inherited bleeding disorder that does not cause lymphocytopenia. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) I, II, IV, V."
