The patient is on clarithromycin, which can prolong the QT interval and lead to Torsades de Pointes (TdP) ventricular tachycardia, which is shown on the ECG strip. The high potassium level (6.1 mEq/L) is also a risk factor for TdP, but the fact that the patient had QT prolongation on a previous ECG suggests that the medication is the more likely cause. Clarithromycin should be discontinued immediately in this scenario."

Hypercalcemia can also cause arrhythmia but the calcium level is within normal range. The low TSH level indicates hyperthyroidism but the patient is not exhibiting classic symptoms.
