The x-ray findings, along with the symptoms of cyanosis and tachypnea, suggest that the most likely diagnosis is congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), which is caused by abnormal budding of the ventral foregut. Fistula between the esophagus and the trachea could cause pneumonia but not the fluid-filled densities seen on the x-ray. Impaired fusion of pleuroperitoneal membrane is associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Increase in alveolar surface tension is associated with respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants."

The x-ray findings suggest pulmonary hypoplasia, which is often associated with abnormal budding of the ventral foregut.

Fistula between the esophagus and trachea would lead to air entering the stomach instead of the lungs. Impaired fusion of the pleuroperitoneal membrane is associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Increase in alveolar surface tension is seen in respiratory distress syndrome, which is unlikely in this scenario."

The presence of fluid-filled densities in the left lung suggests the abnormal budding of the ventral foregut, which can lead to a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. This can cause the lungs to be underdeveloped, leading to cyanosis and decreased breath sounds, as well as increased pulmonary pressure and alveolar surface tension. A fistula between the esophagus and the trachea would result in air filling the gastrointestinal tract and cause gastric distension, which is not seen in this case. Impaired fusion of pleuroperitoneal membrane would result in a diaphragmatic hernia, but not necessarily fluid-filled densities in the lung."
