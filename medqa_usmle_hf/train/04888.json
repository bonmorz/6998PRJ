Failure to thrive with psychosocial etiology is suspected when there is a decrease in weight for age from a previously established growth curve or when the present weight is below the 5th percentile on two separate occasions without evidence of a definitive medical disorder. In this case, the present weight is between the 75th and 50th percentile markers, which suggests a decrease in weight for age, leading to the suspicion of failure to thrive with psychosocial etiology.

However, after plotting his current growth parameters on the growth charts, the pediatrician suspects failure to thrive with a psychosocial etiology because his present weight for age is between 75th and 50th percentile markers. This indicates a decrease in weight gain over time, which is concerning for failure to thrive. Option (A) is incorrect because the child's weight for age is not currently between the 90th and 75th percentile markers.
