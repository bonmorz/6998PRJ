The combination of a decreased level of pregnancy-associated plasma protein and an increased level of \u03b2-hCG suggests a possible chromosomal abnormality in the fetus. Additional testing can be done through chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis which can provide additional chromosomal information from placental or amniotic fluid cells. Option (A) suggests an additional chromosome in placental tissue, which is most likely to confirm or rule out a chromosomal abnormality, such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) or other structural abnormalities. Option (B) refers to decreased estriol, which is associated with Down syndrome but can also be caused by other factors. Option (C) refers to triploidy which is associated with chromosomal abnormalities but is less common than trisomies. Option (D) refers to decreased inhibin A, which is another marker for Down syndrome, but is not the most conclusive diagnostic test."
