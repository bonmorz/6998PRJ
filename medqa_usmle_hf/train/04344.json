The presence of a hypoechoic mass in the thyroid lobe and neoplastic follicular cells suggest a follicular adenoma or carcinoma. The RAS gene mutation also increases the risk of carcinoma. As such, the most appropriate next step in management is thyroid lobectomy, which can help confirm the diagnosis and determine the need for further treatment. Watchful waiting is not appropriate given the risk of malignancy, and radioiodine therapy or total thyroidectomy may not be necessary depending on the pathology results after the thyroid lobectomy."
