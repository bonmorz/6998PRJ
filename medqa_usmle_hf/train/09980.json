The patient's symptom of decreased sensation in the feet and ankles, along with a history of falls, suggests peripheral neuropathy. The presence of proteinuria suggests kidney damage, and incomplete bladder emptying is a common complication of diabetic neuropathy affecting the autonomic nervous system. Increased lower esophageal sphincter pressure and dilated pupils are not typically associated with diabetic neuropathy. Hyperreflexia is not typically associated with peripheral neuropathy or diabetic complications. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) incomplete bladder emptying."
