The symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory results suggest a hepatic abscess, and the hypoechoic lesion with hyperemic rim seen on ultrasonography supports this diagnosis. Among the options, cholangitis is the most likely cause of hepatic abscess due to its association with biliary tract disease. Infectious endocarditis usually presents with multiple small embolic lesions, echinococcosis presents with cystic lesions, and diverticulitis typically causes left-sided abdominal pain."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, leukocyte count, and tender right upper quadrant suggest cholangitis or inflammation of the bile ducts. The hypoechoic lesion in the right lobe of the liver with a hyperemic rim can be a result of cholangitis. Infectious endocarditis would have other accompanying symptoms such as heart murmurs, and echinococcosis would show cysts rather than lesions on imaging.
