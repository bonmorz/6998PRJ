The diabetic patient with albuminuria has early evidence of microvascular disease, which can progress to macrovascular disease. ACE inhibitors such as enalapril have been shown to slow the progression of microalbuminuria to overt nephropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. Options (C) and (D) are not indicated for the treatment of microalbuminuria in diabetes mellitus. Option (A) is incorrect because there are treatments available to slow the progression of microalbuminuria."
