The patient has multiple injection marks around the cubital fossa and hand veins, which strongly suggests intravenous drug use.

While smoking can increase the risk of infection, it is not specifically linked to spinal epidural abscess. Inhaled steroid use is not a known risk factor for this condition. Increased BMI can increase the risk of epidural abscess, but it is not the most likely risk factor in this patient given the history of intravenous drug use."

Among the options, intravenous drug use is the most likely risk factor for the patient's condition, as evidenced by the multiple injection marks visible around the cubital fossa and hand veins.
