The CT scan shows no hemorrhage or major infarct, but rather early ischemic changes in the left middle cerebral artery territory. This suggests that the patient may have had an embolic stroke. Since the time of onset is not specified, it\u2019s unclear if the patient is eligible for thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). However, as the patient has chronic atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation with heparin may increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to administer aspirin, which would reduce the risk of further thrombo-embolic events. It is important to note that this decision should be made in consultation with a neurologist or stroke specialist, and the patient should be monitored closely for any signs of worsening."

Aspirin is the most appropriate next step in the management of a patient with an ischemic stroke to prevent further thrombus formation. Heparin is used for therapeutic anticoagulation, but it is contraindicated in patients with a higher risk of bleeding, which is a possibility since the patient has chronic atrial fibrillation.
