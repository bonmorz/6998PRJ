Inhibition of phosphodiesterase 3 increases levels of cyclic AMP and results in positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart. Vasodilation caused by cilostazol may aid in decreasing afterload and increasing cardiac output, leading to an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume. Angioedema and antiarrhythmic action are not expected effects of cilostazol."

However, this increase in cyclic AMP is also known to increase contractility and therefore, positive inotropy. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.
