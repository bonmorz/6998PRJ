Hairy cell leukemia and Chronic lymphocytic leukemia typically do not present with blast cells, and Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is more commonly seen in children or young adults."

The symptoms of increasing generalized fatigue and weight loss in a middle-aged man with hypertension and hyperlipidemia are suggestive of a malignant hematological disorder. The presence of blast cells on peripheral blood smear and positive staining for myeloperoxidase, CD33, and CD34 strongly suggest acute myeloid leukemia.
