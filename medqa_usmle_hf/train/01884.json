The boy also has wheals on his body, suggesting urticarial rash, which can be caused by an autoimmune reaction. Elevated levels of serum IgA are associated with Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, which presents with glomerulonephritis, joint pain, and skin rash. 24-hour urinary protein is associated with proteinuria, which may be related to glomerulonephritis, but it is not specific. Elevated levels of serum IgG and C3 protein are associated with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, but the boy only had a sore throat and no evidence of recent infection. Elevated IgM-IgG immune complex rheumatoid factors are not specific for any specific disease. Therefore, (B) Elevated level of serum IgA is the most likely associated laboratory finding."
