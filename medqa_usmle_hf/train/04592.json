Alzheimer's disease is mainly caused by the accumulation of beta-amyloid protein in the brain, leading to neurodegeneration. The nucleus basalis is a structure in the basal forebrain that is involved in the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter important for learning and memory. Decreased activity in this area is associated with Alzheimer's disease. The other options are not directly involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease."
