Option B is incorrect because the toxin does not affect acetylcholinesterase. Option C is incorrect because the toxin does not act as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine. Option D is incorrect because the toxin does not lead to prolonged depolarization of NM receptors."

The symptoms and laboratory evaluation suggest botulism, which is caused by the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. The botulism toxin blocks the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, leading to the symptoms of weakness of extraocular muscles, weak gag reflex, and fixed dilated pupils. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Blockade of release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions. Inactivation of acetylcholinesterase at neuromuscular junctions is seen in organophosphate poisoning. Competitive antagonism of acetylcholine at postsynaptic receptors and prolonged depolarization of NM receptors are seen in myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton syndrome, respectively."
