The patient\u2019s symptoms, such as increased sleepiness during the day and difficultly concentrating suggest that he may have sleep apnea. The elevated red blood cell count (hemoglobin and hematocrit) could be due to chronic hypoxia caused by sleep apnea. Cor pulmonale would have presented with peripheral edema, which is not noted in this patient. Diuretic overuse may lead to low blood volume and low red blood cell count, which is not consistent with the lab results. JAK2 mutation is associated with a different kind of abnormal blood count."
