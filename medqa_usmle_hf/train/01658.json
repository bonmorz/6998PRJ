The patient presents with signs of acute abdomen with left lower quadrant tenderness and vomiting, and has a history of obesity, diabetes, alcohol abuse, and hypertension, which makes him high risk for various conditions, such as diverticulitis, ischemic colitis, and malignancy. CT scan is the most accurate and widely used imaging modality for acute abdomen, as it provides a comprehensive view of the abdomen and can identify various pathologies. Barium enema, colonoscopy, and sigmoidoscopy are not ideal tests for acute abdomen, as they require bowel preparation and can be contraindicated in certain conditions. Additionally, they only provide a limited view of the colon and may miss important pathology in other organs of the abdomen."
