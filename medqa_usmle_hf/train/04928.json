The patient's symptoms suggest iliotibial band syndrome, which is commonly seen in runners and athletes who do repetitive knee flexion and extension movements. Tenderness to palpation over the lateral knee and discomfort on adduction during the physical examination also support this diagnosis. Other options would have different symptoms or physical exam findings."

The positive Ober's test, where the leg does not lower to the table in a smooth fashion on hip extension and abduction, is indicative of iliotibial band syndrome. Lateral collateral ligament injury would have instability on valgus stress, while Pes anserine bursitis would have tenderness at the medial aspect of the knee. Musculoskeletal strain is a general term and is not a specific diagnosis for this case."
