In this case, the subtype would be IgG, which exists as a monomer. IgG is typically produced in response to a secondary exposure to an antigen and is responsible for long-term immunity.

IgG antibodies, which also exist as monomers, are produced later in the course of the infection and provide long-term immunity. They are not specific to hepatitis B core antigen. Option (B) is incorrect because pentameric IgM is involved in the complement system activation. Option (C) is incorrect because mast cell activation is mediated by IgE antibodies.
