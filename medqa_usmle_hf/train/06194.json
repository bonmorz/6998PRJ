It is commonly used to treat anaerobic infections such as aspiration pneumonia, which is the diagnosis in this case. Doxycycline and Azithromycin are both macrolide antibiotics, which work by inhibiting protein synthesis. Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that targets bacterial cell wall synthesis. While these antibiotics may also be used to treat pneumonia, they do not work by blocking peptide transfer at the ribosomal subunit."
