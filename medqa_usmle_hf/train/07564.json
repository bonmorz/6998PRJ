The patient also has signs of stomatitis, glossitis, and cheilosis, which suggest a deficiency of vitamin B6. Vitamin B6 deficiency can cause neurological symptoms and tongue and mouth inflammation. Vitamin B9 deficiency can cause megaloblastic anemia and birth defects. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause megaloblastic anemia and neurological symptoms. Vitamin B2 deficiency can cause skin and eye inflammation. None of these deficiencies match the patient's symptoms except for vitamin B6."
