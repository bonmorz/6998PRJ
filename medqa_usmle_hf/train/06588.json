Substance X is likely to be an aldosterone antagonist, as it causes a decrease in urinary sodium concentration and an increase in urinary potassium concentration. Among the options, only aldosterone has the same effect on renal function. Atrial natriuretic peptide increases urinary sodium concentration, while Spironolactone and Furosemide are diuretics that increase urinary sodium concentration and decrease urinary potassium concentration."

Aldosterone has a similar effect on the kidneys as it promotes sodium and water reabsorption while enhancing potassium excretion. Option A, atrial natriuretic peptide, promotes natriuresis and decreases sodium reabsorption. Option B, spironolactone, blocks the action of aldosterone and enhances potassium retention. Option D, furosemide, inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle, leading to increased urinary excretion of these ions."
