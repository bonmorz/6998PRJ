Antibiotics may be added if there is no improvement or worsening of symptoms, but the best choice of antibiotics will depend on the results of culture and sensitivity testing.

Option (C) may be a possible choice of antibiotics but it's not the best intervention for this patient without further information."

Supportive therapy, such as analgesics, hydration, and rest, is often sufficient for resolution of mild to moderate cases of endometritis. Antibiotics may be used if symptoms are severe or if there are signs of systemic infection or sepsis, but the choice of antibiotics depends on the severity of the infection and local resistance patterns, and should be guided by microbiologic culture results if possible. Option A and B include vancomycin and gentamicin, which may not be the first-line therapy for endometritis, and clindamycin and gentamicin may increase the risk of C. difficile infection. Option C includes doxycycline which may not be effective for postpartum endometritis."
