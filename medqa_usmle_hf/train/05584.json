The intense and severe symptoms may be due to dysmenorrhea and can be addressed symptomatically. The patient is not exhibiting other signs of PCOS or pregnancy. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder typically presents with symptoms in the week before menses, which is not described in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is normal development."

Pregnancy is unlikely given the patient\u2019s age and lack of sexual activity.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome can cause irregular menstrual cycles, but it is less likely in a 14-year-old girl without other associated symptoms.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is another possible cause, but additional symptoms need to be present such as acne, excess facial or body hair, and weight gain.
