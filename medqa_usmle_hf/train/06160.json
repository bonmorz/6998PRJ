The patient's presentation with lower limb weakness and absent deep tendon reflexes suggests a lower motor neuron lesion. Furthermore, the recent flu-like symptoms and absence of routine vaccinations raise suspicion for polio. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic pleocytosis and normal glucose concentration is also consistent with poliomyelitis. HSV encephalitis would likely present with altered mental status, and tetanus would present with muscle rigidity and spasms. Guillain-Barre syndrome may have some similar features but the absence of ascending paralysis and the recent travel history make poliomyelitis a more likely diagnosis."

The symptoms and history point towards the most likely diagnosis as Poliomyelitis, which is a viral infection that can cause lower limb weakness. The absence of deep tendon reflexes in one leg is also consistent with polio. The leukocyte count and protein concentration in cerebrospinal fluid can be elevated in polio, but glucose concentration is usually normal. Her lack of vaccination further increases her risk of contracting polio."

The patient's recent travel history and symptoms suggest that the most likely diagnosis is poliomyelitis, which is a viral infection that can cause lower limb weakness. The CSF analysis is consistent with a viral infection. HSV encephalitis would present with more generalized neurological symptoms and elevated CSF protein levels. Tetanus would present with muscle rigidity and spasms rather than weakness. Guillain-Barre syndrome may also present with lower limb weakness, but the CSF analysis typically shows a higher protein concentration and a lower glucose concentration than what is seen in this patient."
