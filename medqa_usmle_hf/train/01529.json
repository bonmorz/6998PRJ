The scratching sound is a pericardial friction rub. ECG shows ST segment elevations often seen in acute pericarditis. Breast cancer and radiation therapy can also increase the risk of pericarditis. Embolic occlusion of a pulmonary artery will show signs of pulmonary embolism on physical examination and imaging. Subendothelial fibrosis of coronary arteries is seen in atherosclerosis, which is not likely in a 51-year-old woman without a history of coronary artery disease. Fibrotic thickening of the pericardium suggests constrictive pericarditis, which is a chronic condition, unlike the patient's acute symptoms."

The patient's symptoms, including shortness of breath and substernal chest pain that worsens on inspiration and lying down, suggest pericarditis. The scratching sound heard on cardiac examination also supports this diagnosis. The ECG shows ST segment elevations, which is a common finding in acute pericarditis. Neutrophilic infiltration of the pericardium is the most likely underlying cause in this case, as the patient has a history of breast cancer and radiation therapy, which can lead to pericarditis. Embolic occlusion of a pulmonary artery would present with different symptoms, such as sudden onset dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain.
