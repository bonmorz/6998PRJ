The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain with diffuse tenderness, guarding, and rebound, absent bowel sounds, and leukocytosis suggests an acute abdominal condition requiring urgent surgery. The most likely cause is perforation, possibly due to a gastric or duodenal ulcer in this patient with a history of chronic lower back pain and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen). Ruptured ectopic pregnancy would cause lower abdominal pain localized to one side, and bowel obstruction would cause a more gradual onset of symptoms with constipation and vomiting. Colorectal cancer is unlikely in a patient of this age and with no family history of colon cancer."
