The given situation is an example of classical conditioning, where the sound of the flushing toilet acts as a conditional stimulus that elicits a reflexive response (jumping back) similar to an unconditioned response (jumping back from hot water). White coat syndrome is also an example of classical conditioning, where the sight of a white lab coat acts as a conditional stimulus that elicits a conditioned response (anxiety) even in the absence of an actual threat. The other options are examples of operant conditioning, where a behavior is strengthened or weakened based on consequences."

The process detailed in the question is an example of classical conditioning, where the sound of the flushing toilet (neutral stimulus) becomes associated with the experience of hot water (unconditioned stimulus), leading to a conditioned response (jumping out of the way of the water). Similarly, white coat syndrome is an example of classical conditioning, where the sight of a white lab coat (neutral stimulus) becomes associated with negative experiences such as pain or fear (unconditioned stimulus), leading to a conditioned response (anxiety or fear). The other options describe operant conditioning (checking pay telephones for change after finding it previously), punishment avoidance (child not throwing tantrums to avoid being grounded), and avoidance conditioning (mouse pressing a red button to avoid receiving shocks)."

The conditioning process in the scenario is classical conditioning, where a stimuli (flushing toilet sound) becomes associated with a response (jumping out of the way of hot water) even in the absence of the actual stimuli. Option (D) is most similar because it also involves a learned response to a stimuli, in this case the sight of a white lab coat causing patient anxiety even though the white coat has no direct impact on their health or treatment. This is also a form of classical conditioning. The other options are examples of operant conditioning."

Options A, B, and C describe operant conditioning, in which behavior is modified by rewards and punishments rather than through association of stimuli."
