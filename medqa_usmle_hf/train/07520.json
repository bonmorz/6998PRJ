High doses of systemic corticosteroids is the standard treatment, but if there is no clinical improvement after 4 weeks, immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate should be added. Rituximab is another immunosuppressive agent but is typically used for refractory cases. Tacrolimus has not been studied extensively in dermatomyositis, and intravenous immunoglobulin is typically used in acute flares."

Rituximab is also used for dermatomyositis but is often reserved as a second-line therapy. Tacrolimus is more commonly used for organ transplant rejection.
