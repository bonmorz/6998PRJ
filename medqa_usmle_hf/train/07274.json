The physical exam findings suggest that the patient has transient synovitis of the hip, which is a self-limited condition that is treated with analgesics such as ibuprofen for pain control. Arthrocentesis may be used if there is concern for septic arthritis, but this patient's CRP level and lack of swelling make septic arthritis less likely. MRI may be considered if the symptoms do not improve or if there is concern for another diagnosis. Prednisone is not indicated for this condition."
