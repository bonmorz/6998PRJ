The fact that the patient has stable angina suggests that the headaches are not caused by a transient ischemic attack or acute hemorrhage. Beta adrenergic inactivation is unlikely to cause throbbing headaches. Vasodilation of cerebral arteries is a common side effect of nitroglycerin, which is a medication commonly used to treat stable angina. Therefore, vasodilation of cerebral arteries is the most likely cause of the patient's throbbing headaches."
