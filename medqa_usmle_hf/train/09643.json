The patient has no known allergies and just started a new medication, indicating a possible medication-induced reaction. The symptoms also suggest angioedema, which is caused by increased levels of bradykinin, either due to decreased degradation or increased production. Option (C) fits this mechanism of action, while the other options are not related to angioedema. The newly diagnosed hypertension and newly started medication can also be risk factors for angioedema."

Among the options, decreased bradykinin degradation is the most likely mechanism. Bradykinin is a vasodilator and increased levels can cause increased permeability of blood vessels, leading to edema. In normal circumstances, bradykinin is rapidly degraded by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), but some hypertension medications can inhibit ACE, leading to increased levels of bradykinin and triggering angioedema."

Option A is not the correct mechanism, as decreased receptor response would lead to decreased angiotensin II, not increased.
