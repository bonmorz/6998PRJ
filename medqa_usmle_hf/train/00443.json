ZES often leads to gastrinoma, and MEN1, a syndrome that is associated with the development of multiple endocrine neoplasia, including gastrinoma, is the most likely cause of ZES in this patient. NF2 is associated with neurofibromatosis type 2, C-Kit is associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), and RET is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) and type 2B (MEN2B).
