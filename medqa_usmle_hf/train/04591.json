The presence of an enlarged tongue and pale appearance suggest that the patient may have systemic amyloidosis, which is characterized by deposition of an extracellular fibrillar protein that stains positive for Congo red. The symptoms, including hepatic enlargement, ankle edema, chest auscultation, and low voltage waves, are consistent with cardiac involvement. Myocardial speckling on echocardiogram and diastolic dysfunction also support this diagnosis. Concentric hypertrophy of the myocytes is seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, calcification of the aortic valve orifice with obstruction of LVOT is seen in aortic stenosis, and reciprocal variation in ventricular filling with respiration is seen in pulsus paradoxus."

The extracellular deposition of an amyloid fibril protein that stains positive for Congo red in the myocardium is the mechanism underlying cardiac amyloidosis. Option B is suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, option C is suggestive of aortic stenosis, and option D describes one aspect of diastolic dysfunction but does not fully explain the patient's presentation."
