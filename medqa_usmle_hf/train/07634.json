The patient has symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) likely caused by Clostridium difficile infection secondary to the recent use of multiple medications. The presence of schistocytes, thrombocytopenia, and elevated creatinine level confirms the diagnosis. Treatment for HUS includes plasma exchange to remove the harmful substances. Renal dialysis helps in clearing excess fluids and waste products from the blood but does not address the underlying cause. Intravenous immunoglobulin is used in the treatment of immune-mediated disorders and not HUS. Rehydration is necessary but not a treatment for HUS."

Intravenous immunoglobulin has been used in some cases of TTP, but it is not considered a first-line treatment."
