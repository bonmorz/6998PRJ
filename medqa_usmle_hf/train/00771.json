Intention-to-treat analysis is most appropriate in this case, as it includes all patients who were randomized and thus accounts for the potential bias introduced by patients lost to follow-up or who did not complete treatment. Per-protocol analysis would only include patients who completed treatment according to their assigned arm, which would not provide an accurate representation of real-world use. Sub-group analysis would further divide the already reduced sample size and increase the risk of bias. Non-inferiority analysis is not applicable in this case as the goal is to prove superiority of Aclotsaban."

This method ensures that bias and confounding factors are minimized and provides a more accurate representation of the effectiveness of the treatment in a real-world setting. Per-protocol analysis and sub-group analysis exclude certain patients, which can introduce bias and reduce the generalizability of the results. Non-inferiority analysis is used to demonstrate that a new treatment is not worse than the standard of care, rather than showing superiority."

The most appropriate technique in this scenario is an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all patients who were enrolled in the study and analyzes them according to the group to which they were originally assigned, regardless of whether or not they completed the treatment or were lost to follow-up. This is important in order to avoid bias and provide a more accurate representation of real-world clinical practice.

Intention-to-treat analysis is the most appropriate technique to use in this scenario as it includes all randomized patients, regardless of whether they completed the study or not, and analyzes them according to their assigned treatment arm. This technique aims to closely mimic a real-world scenario and is considered the gold standard for clinical trial analysis. Per-protocol analysis only includes patients who completed the treatment according to their assigned arm, which may introduce bias. Sub-group analysis can be used to look at specific populations within the study, but it is not the most appropriate technique to prove the superiority of the drug overall. Non-inferiority analysis is used when a new treatment is not expected to be better than the current standard of care but may have other benefits, so it is not appropriate in this scenario."

Therefore, the most appropriate technique is intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all patients randomized regardless of protocol adherence and maintains randomization throughout the analysis."
