The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is characterized by irregular menstrual bleeding, elevated luteinizing hormone, and elevated testosterone.

Elevated serum beta-HCG would suggest pregnancy, adrenal tumor would likely show abnormal levels of aldosterone or cortisol, and an intrasellar mass would suggest a pituitary tumor."
