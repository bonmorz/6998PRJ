VSD is a hole in the wall (septum) between the left and right ventricles of the heart, which allows blood to flow between them instead of to the body. This can cause oxygen-poor blood to be pumped to the body, leading to cyanosis (bluish discoloration due to lack of oxygen) and dyspnea (shortness of breath). Squatting increases systemic vascular resistance and decreases pulmonary resistance, leading to more blood flow to the lungs and less shunting of blood through the VSD. This temporarily relieves the symptoms."
