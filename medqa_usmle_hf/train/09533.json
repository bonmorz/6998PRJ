The clinical presentation, with fever, profuse watery diarrhea, lethargy, sunken eyes, and dry mucous membranes, suggests dehydration. The most appropriate initial step is to administer intravenous 0.9% saline solution to rehydrate the patient. The laboratory values indicate hypernatremia, which further suggests dehydration. Administering 0.45% saline or 5% dextrose in water may be appropriate after hydration is established. Performing a stool PCR for rotavirus antigen is not necessary at this point as the patient's presentation is consistent with viral gastroenteritis and the priority is to manage dehydration."

Option B is not the most appropriate initial step as it is important to address the patient's dehydration first before identifying the specific cause of diarrhea. Option C is not appropriate as 0.45% saline solution may not provide enough fluid and electrolyte replacement. Option D is not appropriate as the patient's glucose level is normal and glucose-containing solutions should be avoided in the early management of dehydration."
