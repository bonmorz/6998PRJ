The key to answering this question is recognizing that the patients are all presenting with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), a type of kidney disease that occurs after infection with certain strains of Group A Streptococcus bacteria. The disease is most common in children and usually resolves on its own within a few weeks without treatment. Therefore, the best prognosis is seen in the 8-year-old boy who undergoes no treatment. The other patients may have factors that negatively impact their prognosis, such as age or underlying medical conditions."
