The reduced cAMP level decreases the activation of the lac operon by the catabolite activator protein (CAP). Therefore, the addition of glucose reduces lactose fermentation by decreasing cAMP levels and subsequent CAP activation. Option (A) is incorrect because the repressor inhibits transcription of the operon by binding to the operator. Option (B) is incorrect because CAP enhances transcription by binding upstream of the promoter. Option (C) is incorrect because glucose inhibits the production of cAMP."

The addition of glucose leads to decreased levels of cAMP, which negatively affects the activity of CAP, a factor required for optimal lac operon activity. This reduces lactose fermentation. The repressor binds to the operator in the absence of lactose, preventing transcription. The addition of lactose leads to reduced binding of the repressor to the operator, allowing for transcription of the lac operon. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect. Option (B) is incorrect because CAP is needed for optimal lac operon activity, and increased binding to it would lead to increased lactose fermentation. Option (C) is incorrect because cAMP levels are usually high in the absence of glucose, which increases binding to CAP, resulting in increased lactose fermentation."

The presence of glucose triggers the synthesis of cAMP, which decreases the amount of cAMP-CAP, thereby decreasing transcription of the lac operon. This is because the cAMP-CAP complex is needed for maximum transcription of the operon since it stimulates RNA polymerase binding. Additionally, glucose inhibits the adenylate cyclase enzyme that is responsible for cAMP synthesis, which further reduces cAMP-CAP and lac operon transcription. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) decreased level of cAMP."
