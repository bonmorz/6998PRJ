The patient\u2019s behavior of not responding to her name, not following directions, and not playing with other children are common symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. The fact that the patient was meeting developmental milestones until recently makes options A and D less likely, and option C is unlikely given the concern expressed by the parents. The flapping motions with her hands suggest autism as well."

The symptoms described fit the criteria for Autism spectrum disorder, including difficulty with social interaction, repetitive behaviors or interests, and delayed or abnormal language and communication development. The patient\u2019s lack of responsiveness to her name and inability to play with other children are key indicators. The patient\u2019s ability to draw detailed trains and run around the room suggests good motor skills. ADHD is more characterized by hyperactivity, impulsiveness and inattention, which is not reflected in this patient\u2019s symptoms. Rett syndrome presents in females and is characterized by loss of motor and communication abilities, which is not consistent with this patient\u2019s history."
