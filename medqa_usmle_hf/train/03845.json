The symptoms and biopsy findings are consistent with tuberculosis, which is caused by a delayed T cell-mediated reaction. Antibody-mediated cytotoxic reactions involve antibodies attacking cells, combined type III/IV hypersensitivity reactions involve immune complexes and inflammation, and immune complex deposition involves the deposition of immune complexes in tissues. None of these are consistent with tuberculosis."
