ASCUS is a category of abnormal findings on a Pap smear that indicate that there are some atypical squamous cells present, but it is not clear if they are indicative of pre-cancerous or cancerous changes. The next best step in the management of this patient is to perform an HPV DNA test, as this can help determine if the patient is at higher risk for developing cervical cancer. Repeat Pap smear can be done in 1 year if the HPV DNA test is negative, and LEEP is only done if there are more significant findings on the Pap smear or the HPV DNA test."
