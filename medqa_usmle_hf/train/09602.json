A fingerstick blood glucose concentration of 47 mg/dL suggests hypoglycemia, which can lead to symptoms such as sweating, tremors, and confusion. Propranolol, which is a beta-blocker, can mask some of these symptoms by antagonizing beta2-adrenergic receptors. This is the most likely pharmacologic mechanism responsible for the absence of symptoms in this patient."
