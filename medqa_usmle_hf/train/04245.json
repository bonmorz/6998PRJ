The fact that the intensity of the murmur decreases with the handgrip maneuver confirms the diagnosis of aortic stenosis and suggests that the cause of the symptoms is dystrophic calcification on the aortic valve. Option A refers to Marfan syndrome, which is associated with aortic aneurysm, not stenosis. Option B refers to infective endocarditis, which is more likely to cause mitral or tricuspid valve issues. Option D refers to rheumatic fever, which is a cause of mitral stenosis."
