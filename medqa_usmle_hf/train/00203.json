The patient has wet gangrene on her right leg which indicates poor circulation, leading to hypoxemia and finally respiratory failure. The high FiO2 suggests that the patient has respiratory failure due to a problem with gas exchange, not ventilation. The arterial blood gas shows a low PO2, indicating hypoxemia. The most likely finding will be fluid in the alveolar space, reflecting the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by sepsis."

Therefore, the most likely finding in further evaluation of this patient is fluid in the alveolar space.
