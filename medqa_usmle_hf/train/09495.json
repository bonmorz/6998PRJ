Bedwetting can be a sign of stress or anxiety, and the birth of a new sibling may trigger such feelings in a child. Punishing the child for bedwetting can add to the stress, leading to a exacerbation of the behavior. Therefore, the reappearance of bedwetting in this case is best described as regression. Isolation of affect involves disconnecting oneself from emotions, identification involves adopting behaviors or characteristics of someone else, and rationalization involves justifying or explaining away behavior. None of these options fit this scenario."

Regression is the defense mechanism where an individual returns to an earlier stage of development, and bedwetting is a common example of regression in children.

The recommended approach aims to reduce stress and promote positive reinforcement."
