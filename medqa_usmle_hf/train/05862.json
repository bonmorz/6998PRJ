Therefore, in this case, the elevated WBC count suggests a severe pancreatitis with associated inflammation and infection, which may lead to increased mortality. The other laboratory values reflect liver function (alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin) and pancreatic enzyme levels (amylase and lipase), which may indicate the severity of the disease but are not as strongly associated with mortality as WBC count."
