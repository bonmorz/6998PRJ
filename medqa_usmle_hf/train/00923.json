The rash appears to be consistent with a fungal infection, which would be treated with an anti-fungal medication such as topical clotrimazole. Oral acitretin is used to treat psoriasis, which is not the likely diagnosis based on the presentation. Topical hydrocortisone is a steroid that is used to relieve itching and reduce inflammation but it may not be effective against a fungal infection. Topical salicylic acid is used to treat conditions like acne and psoriasis, but it is not effective against fungal infections."
