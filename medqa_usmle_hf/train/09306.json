Splitting is the defense mechanism in which a person splits the world into all-good and all-bad, and is demonstrated in this scenario with the girl seeing her mother as all-good and her father as all-bad. Denial is the refusal to accept reality, projection is attributing one's undesirable thoughts or emotions to others, and regression is reverting to an earlier stage of development.
