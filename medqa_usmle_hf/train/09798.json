The urinalysis showing >100,000 cfu/mL of E. coli indicates a urinary tract infection, but it is important to note that this may be an asymptomatic bacteriuria and not the cause of her current symptoms. Therefore, there is no need for antimicrobial treatment unless she is symptomatic and has a positive urine culture. Thus, the correct answer is (D) No treatment."
