The patient presents with severe epigastric pain, radiating to the back, worsened by swallowing and coughing, and a history of vomiting. The physical exam finding of mediastinal crackling in synchrony with cardiac contraction suggests Boerhaave syndrome, which is a transmural esophageal rupture. Coronary artery occlusion and dissection of the aorta both present with chest pain but not with these specific symptoms. Ulcerative changes in the gastric mucosa can cause pain but do not explain the other symptoms."

The severe epigastric pain that worsens with swallowing and radiates to the back is indicative of transmural esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome), which is more likely in patients with a history of emesis, alcohol use, and smoking. Mediastinal crackling on cardiac auscultation is classically seen in Boerhaave syndrome. Coronary artery occlusion and aortic dissection usually present with chest pain, but it is not as severe and radiating to the back. Ulcerative changes in the gastric mucosa would not cause mediastinal crackling on cardiac auscultation."
