The presentation suggests beta-thalassemia, which is confirmed by the laboratory results showing microcytic anemia with elevated red cell distribution width. The plain radiograph shows hair-on-end appearance, an indication of extramedullary hematopoiesis. Hemoglobin F is the predominant type of hemoglobin in infants, so option (B) is the correct answer. Hemoglobin Bart is seen in alpha-thalassemia, and hemoglobin S is seen in sickle cell anemia, but neither is a likely diagnosis based on the information given. Hemoglobin A2 is a minor hemoglobin component and not relevant for this patient\u2019s presentation."
