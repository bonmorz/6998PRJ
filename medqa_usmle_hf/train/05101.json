The patient presents with chest pain and a history of SLE, Sjogren syndrome, and interstitial lung disease, which put her at risk for pericarditis. The exam findings suggest cardiac tamponade, which is a medical emergency. The most likely electrocardiogram finding in this case would be QRS complex height variation, as this is a common finding in cardiac tamponade. ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF are a sign of inferior wall myocardial infarction, which is less likely given the patient's history. Polymorphic P waves and wide QRS complexes with no P waves are not typical findings in cardiac tamponade."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest cardiac tamponade, which occurs when fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac and compresses the heart. The filling of the internal jugular vein at 9 cm above the sternal angle and distant heart sounds indicate decreased cardiac output. QRS complex height variation is a common electrocardiographic finding in cardiac tamponade due to the presence of alternating high- and low-amplitude QRS complexes. ST elevations, polymorphic P waves, and wide QRS complexes with no P waves are not commonly associated with cardiac tamponade."
