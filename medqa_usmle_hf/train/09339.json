NADPH oxidase deficiency, also known as chronic granulomatous disease, is a disorder that affects the immune system\u2019s ability to fight off certain bacterial and fungal infections. This disorder is characterized by recurrent infections such as lymphadenopathy, fever, and abscesses. Defective neutrophil chemotaxis is associated with leukocyte adhesion deficiency. Impaired repair of double-strand DNA breaks is associated with ataxia telangiectasia. Impaired signaling to actin cytoskeleton reorganization is associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome."
