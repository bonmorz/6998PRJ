The patient\u2019s fear of leaving her mother and difficulty in adjusting to a new grade further supports this diagnosis. Social anxiety and agoraphobia are less likely as the patient does not have specific fears of social situations or leaving the house. Truancy is not the correct answer as the patient\u2019s refusal to attend school is due to anxiety and not a desire to skip school."
