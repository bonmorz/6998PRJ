A femoral neck fracture may cause hip and groin pain but is unlikely in the absence of trauma, and the patient only reports a fall off a treadmill, which is unlikely to cause a fracture.

Femoral neck fracture causes hip pain but typically with more acute onset, and an obese patient like this one is at higher risk for osteoarthritis than fracture.

The patient's symptoms, including pain in the hip and groin, decreased range of motion, and crepitus, suggest osteoarthritis. The tenting of the skin indicates dehydration, which can be a complication of acute renal failure. The high doses of vitamin D may also be contributing to the patient's symptoms as excessive vitamin D intake can lead to hypercalcemia, which can worsen osteoarthritis. Radiography is likely to show loss of joint space and osteophytes, which are common findings in osteoarthritis. Hyperdense foci in the ureters suggest the presence of kidney stones, which are not related to the patient's symptoms. Femoral neck fracture may be possible due to the recent fall, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with osteoarthritis."
