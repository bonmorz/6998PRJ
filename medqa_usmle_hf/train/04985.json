However, her symptoms and synovial fluid analysis suggest an acute septic arthritis, which is caused by the hematogenous spread of infection from another site in the body. Arthrocentesis showing a high PMN count and presence of bacteria further supports this diagnosis. Option A implies rheumatoid arthritis, which is not suggested by the given information. Option B suggests an injury, but the synovial fluid analysis does not support this. Option D suggests gout, but there is no mention of typical precipitating factors or urate crystal presence in the synovial fluid."

The symptoms and synovial fluid analysis suggest septic arthritis, which is caused by hematogenous spread of infection.

Autoimmune response to bacterial infection implies that the immune system is attacking healthy joint tissue, which is not the case here. Occult meniscal tear would not explain the synovial fluid analysis findings. Intra-articular deposition of urate crystals would suggest gout instead."

Autoimmune response to bacterial infection (option A) is less likely given the absence of a known bacterial infection. Occult meniscal tear (option B) would not cause the patient's other symptoms.

The 2-cm ulcer on the right toe can be a possible source of hematogenous spread of infection to the right knee, leading to the symptoms she is experiencing. The synovial fluid analysis also supports this hypothesis with a high WBC count and an elevated percentage of PMN cells.
