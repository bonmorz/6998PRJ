Option (B) may indicate systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but this diagnosis is less likely given the patient\u2019s symptoms.

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a possible sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as gonorrhea or chlamydia, which can lead to reactive arthritis. The presence of conjunctivitis supports the possibility of reactive arthritis. The patient\u2019s mother\u2019s autoimmune disease suggests a possible genetic predisposition. HLA-B27 is a genetic marker that is associated with an increased risk of developing reactive arthritis. Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to reveal a HLA-B27 positive genotype. The hiking trip two months ago and chondrocalcinosis are not relevant to the patient\u2019s current symptoms. Positive anti-dsDNA antibodies are associated with lupus nephritis, but this is not suggested by the patient\u2019s history and symptoms."
