The patient has a positive apnea test, absent brainstem reflexes, and no known family members or instructions for end-of-life care. Based on these findings, it is appropriate to remove the ventilator as continued mechanical ventilation is futile, and the patient should be allowed to die with dignity. Ethics committee consultation or court order may be appropriate in some cases, but the patient\u2019s clinical condition and lack of decision makers make it necessary to remove the ventilator. A repeat CT scan is unlikely to change the clinical situation."
