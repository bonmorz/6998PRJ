The patient's symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) IIa, which is characterized by medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism. The elevated calcitonin and PTH levels, as well as the presence of adrenal lesions, support this diagnosis. FMTC is a subtype of MEN II and does not typically involve adrenal lesions. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a syndrome associated with multiple types of cancer but does not typically involve endocrine tumors. MEN IIb is also a subtype of MEN II but is characterized by the presence of mucosal neuromas, as well as medullary thyroid cancer and pheochromocytoma. The absence of mucosal neuromas in this patient makes MEN IIb less likely."
