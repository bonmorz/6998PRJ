The patient presents with severe chest pain, radiating to the back and shoulders, diaphoresis, widened mediastinum on chest x-ray, and diastolic decrescendo murmur, all of which suggest aortic dissection. The elevated blood pressure in one arm compared to the other is also suggestive of aortic dissection. The patient's past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus also puts him at increased risk for aortic dissection. Treatment with morphine and beta-blockers is appropriate, as they help reduce pain and lower blood pressure, respectively."

The non-specific ST segment and T wave changes on ECG and the patient\u2019s medical history should not be ignored but are less suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. Pulmonary embolism can cause chest pain but usually presents with shortness of breath instead of retrosternal pain radiating to the back and shoulders. Aortic regurgitation can cause a diastolic murmur but typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms."

The patient\u2019s presentation is consistent with aortic dissection, due to the sharp, intense, and radiating chest pain, widened mediastinum on chest radiograph, and diaphoresis which can be seen in patients with aortic dissection. The diastolic decrescendo murmur over the left sternal border suggests aortic regurgitation, but this is not the most likely diagnosis given the other symptoms and findings. Pulmonary embolism can also cause chest pain and shortness of breath, but the pain is often pleuritic and associated with changes in breathing or body position. The ECG changes are non-specific and could be seen in a number of conditions, but the combination of findings and symptoms point to aortic dissection."

The patient\u2019s symptoms and risk factors suggest aortic dissection, especially with the widened mediastinum on chest X-ray and the diastolic decrescendo murmur heard on physical examination. The non-specific ST segment and T wave changes on ECG can be seen in aortic dissection, but also in other cardiac conditions such as acute myocardial infarction. The patient\u2019s blood pressure discrepancy in the arms is also a sign of aortic dissection. Treatment with intravenous morphine and beta-blockers is appropriate for managing the pain and hypertension associated with aortic dissection. Timely diagnosis and surgical intervention are necessary to avoid rupture or other complications."

The severe chest pain radiating to the back and shoulders, a widened mediastinum on chest radiograph, and a diastolic decrescendo murmur suggest aortic dissection.

Pulmonary embolism would present with different symptoms and findings on chest radiograph and ECG. Aortic regurgitation may have a similar murmur but would not present with chest pain of this severity."
