The symptoms of difficulty walking, shaking movements of the hands, and rigidity indicate extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), which are common with antipsychotic medication use. Fluphenazine is a dopamine antagonist, so a drug with a similar mechanism of action would likely worsen the symptoms. Therefore, a muscarinic antagonist is most likely to provide relief by blocking the excess cholinergic activity that contributes to EPS."
