The symptoms described suggest that the baby may have tetralogy of Fallot, which includes right ventricular outflow obstruction, ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. The harsh systolic murmur heard over the left upper sternal border is consistent with the right ventricular outflow obstruction. Option A is not consistent as hypoplasia of the left ventricle would result in decreased heart function rather than a systolic murmur. Option B is not consistent as narrowing of the distal aortic arch would result in decreased blood flow rather than a systolic murmur. Option D is not consistent as anatomic reversal of aorta and pulmonary artery would result in transposition of great vessels rather than a systolic murmur."
