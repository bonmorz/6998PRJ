ApoC-II is a co-factor for lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, which enables VLDL particles to catalyze triglyceride hydrolysis. The transfer of ApoC-II from HDL to VLDL particles could explain why only VLDL particles with transferred proteins are able to catalyze triglyceride hydrolysis. The other options, Apo-A1 and ApoB-100, are important components of HDL and VLDL particles respectively, but are not directly involved in catalyzing triglyceride hydrolysis.
