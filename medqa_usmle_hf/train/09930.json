CT scan of the head without contrast is the initial study of choice in patients suspected of having a subarachnoid hemorrhage as it can rapidly detect the presence of blood in the subarachnoid space. Lumbar puncture can help confirm a diagnosis, but it should not be performed until CT scan has been done. MRI scan of the brain and CT angiography of the head are not first-line studies for suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage."
