The lack of a sagittal cranial suture suggests craniosynostosis, which is a possible complication of Graves disease during pregnancy.

Group B streptococcus in the blood is a potential complication of neonatal sepsis, but there is no information in the question to suggest sepsis. Low hemoglobin and pericardial effusion are not related to the condition described in the question."
