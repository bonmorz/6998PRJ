The patient\u2019s history of alcohol consumption and recent intake of a pint of vodka prior to admission suggest that alcoholic hallucinosis is the most likely cause of his symptoms. Delirium tremens can also occur in patients with alcohol use disorder, but the symptoms typically appear earlier than 12 hours after the last drink. Cocaine intoxication and brief psychotic disorder are less likely, given the patient\u2019s history of alcohol use and presence of fine tremors, which are more characteristic of alcohol withdrawal."

The patient's history of regular drinking for the past 10 years, consumption of alcohol prior to admission, and presence of auditory hallucinations are indicative of alcoholic hallucinosis. Delirium tremens is characterized by tremors, confusion, and hallucinations but usually occurs during or after withdrawal from alcohol, while the patient is still in the hospital after stopping alcohol use. Cocaine intoxication and brief psychotic disorder may also cause hallucinations, but the patient's history of regular alcohol use and absence of cocaine use in the past 12 hours make those less likely."
