The woman moved from a low-altitude area (New York City) to a high-altitude area (Denver), leading to a decrease in oxygen saturation due to decreased atmospheric pressure. This will stimulate an increase in erythropoietin, which will increase red blood cell production and plasma volume to compensate for the decreased oxygen saturation. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) - an increase in erythropoietin and a decrease in O2 saturation, with no change in plasma volume."

Denver has a higher altitude than New York City, which means there is less atmospheric pressure and less oxygen in the air.

The change in altitude from sea level in New York City to the higher altitude in Denver can cause an increase in erythropoietin levels which stimulates red blood cell production leading to an overall increase in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. This can cause a decrease in O2 saturation due to the shift in the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. However, as the plasma volume takes time to adjust, it remains unchanged temporarily. Therefore, the most likely set of changes is an increase in erythropoietin levels, a decrease in O2 saturation, and an unchanged plasma volume, which is option (D)."
