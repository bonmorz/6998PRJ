The patient's symptoms suggest hepatic encephalopathy, and the presence of abdominal ascites and jaundice suggest cirrhosis. The best initial treatment for hepatic encephalopathy is administration of lactulose, which helps to decrease the absorption of ammonia from the gut, a contributing factor to the development of hepatic encephalopathy. Liver transplantation is a definitive treatment option for end-stage liver disease but is not the next best step in management for hepatic encephalopathy. Administering rifaximin, neomycin, or glucose alone does not address the underlying cause of hepatic encephalopathy."

The patient's symptoms suggest hepatic encephalopathy, and the next best step in management is to administer lactulose.

Liver transplantation may be an eventual option, but it is not the next step in management. Rifaximin and neomycin are also treatments for hepatic encephalopathy, but lactulose is the preferred first-line agent. Glucose is not a treatment for hepatic encephalopathy."
