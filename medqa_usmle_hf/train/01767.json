The patient presents with chest pain, hoarseness, hypertension, and past smoking history, which are risk factors for aortic dissection. The sudden drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness suggest a possible dissecting aortic aneurysm. Transthoracic echocardiography is the most reliable test for diagnosing aortic dissection. Chest X-ray can show widened mediastinum but is less specific, EKG and cardiac troponins are more specific for myocardial infarction but less likely to be positive in aortic dissection."

This patient is presenting with symptoms of an aortic dissection or rupture, given the sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the back, hoarseness, and an early diastolic murmur. The syncopal episode and the subsequent low blood pressure suggest that this may have progressed to a state of shock. Transthoracic echocardiography is the next best step in management to assess for aortic dissection or rupture, as it can visualize the aortic arch and may show an intimal flap or aortic dissection. Chest X-ray and EKG can be done concurrently, but would not necessarily provide definitive diagnosis in this scenario. Cardiac troponins may be elevated in aortic dissection or rupture, but may also be elevated in other cardiac conditions such as myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure, and would not be the definitive diagnostic tool in this scenario."
