Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain itself, rather than just the meninges, which can cause clouded sensorium and other neurological symptoms such as confusion and agitation.

However, cerebrospinal fluid analysis would be needed to confirm the diagnosis."

While all of the listed symptoms can occur in both encephalitis and meningitis, clouded sensorium (confusion or altered level of consciousness) is more commonly seen in encephalitis. Meningitis usually results in a stiff neck, while encephalitis does not. The normal CT scan of the head suggests that there is no bleeding or mass effect. The final diagnosis will depend on cerebrospinal fluid results. Empiric treatment with acyclovir is appropriate since it covers most viral causes of encephalitis."
