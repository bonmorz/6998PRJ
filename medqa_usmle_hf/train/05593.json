The pain in both legs that increases with walking, especially downhill, for a patient with a significant smoking history suggests peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

Ankle-brachial index (ABI) may also be performed to evaluate for PAD, but it is not the next best step in management. Cilostazol may be used for PAD, but the patient's symptoms are not clearly indicative of PAD at this time. CT angiography may also be ordered if PAD is highly suspected."
