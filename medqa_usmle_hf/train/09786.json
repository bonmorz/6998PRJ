The patient's high hemoglobin A1c level indicates poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, and the symptoms suggest diabetic neuropathy. Among the options, glimepiride is a sulfonylurea drug that helps to lower blood sugar levels by increasing insulin production from the pancreatic islet cells. As a result, the patient's islet cells would produce increasing amounts of secretory granules in response to this drug. Metformin does not increase insulin production; it works by decreasing glucose production in the liver. Pioglitazone and acarbose work differently to lower blood sugar levels."
