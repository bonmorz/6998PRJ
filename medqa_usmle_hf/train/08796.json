The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest hypertensive emergency, and Labetalol is a commonly used medication for this condition. It works by blocking both beta- and alpha-adrenergic receptors, resulting in decreased heart rate and vasodilation, which reduces blood pressure. The drop in heart rate and blood pressure seen in the patient after medication administration supports the use of Labetalol. Hydralazine, Fenoldopam, and Nitroprusside are also medications used for hypertensive emergency, but they have different mechanisms of action and would not necessarily produce the same response as seen in this patient."
