Bone marrow biopsy is not necessary at this time. Testing for EBV, HIV, and CMV is unlikely to be helpful in the immediate management. Decreasing methimazole dose may not be sufficient to address the agranulocytosis and carries a risk of not adequately treating Graves disease."

Bone marrow biopsy is not necessary at this point as the patient's symptoms and lab values strongly suggest drug-induced agranulocytosis. Testing for EBV, HIV, and CMV may be helpful in certain circumstances, but the next step is to immediately discontinue the methimazole.

Since the patient recently started on methimazole for Graves disease and is experiencing agranulocytosis (low white blood cell count), a potential side effect of methimazole, discontinuing the medication is the most appropriate next step in management. Bone marrow biopsy is not necessary at this time since the low white blood cell count is likely related to the medication. Testing for EBV, HIV, and CMV would not be the most appropriate next step without further indication.
