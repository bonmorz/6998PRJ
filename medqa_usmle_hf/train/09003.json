An increase in oxygen concentration at the pulmonary artery indicates increased cardiac output.

Normal findings or pulseless electrical activity would not explain the patient's symptoms. Widespread ST-segment elevations would indicate a new myocardial infarction, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation."

Normal findings and pulseless electrical activity are less likely due to the patient's symptoms and vital signs.
