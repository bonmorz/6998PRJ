The telangiectasias, bluish discoloration of the fingertips, and midsternal chest pain suggest systemic sclerosis, which is often associated with an elevated anti-centromere antibody titer. Dysphagia and thickening and tightening of the skin on the fingers are common features of systemic sclerosis. Spasm of blood vessels in response to cold or stress is also a common feature, but an erythematous periorbital rash is not typically associated with systemic sclerosis. Therefore, option (B) is least likely to be seen."
