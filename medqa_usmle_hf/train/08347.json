Platelet count is normal ruling out immune thrombocytopenia. The combination of hemolysis and a prosthetic heart valve suggests mechanical hemolysis, which often results in the formation of schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells) in the blood smear. Therefore, the correct answer is (B). Dacrocytes are tear-drop shaped red blood cells and are seen in myeloproliferative disorders, Basophilic stippling is seen in lead poisoning, and Degmacytes are seen in thalassemia."
