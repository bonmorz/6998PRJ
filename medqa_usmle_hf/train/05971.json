The photomicrograph shows multiple schistocytes, indicating that the patient has microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), which is commonly seen in patients with mechanical heart valves. Among the options, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a common finding in MAHA due to the release of intracellular LDH from damaged red blood cells. Elevated bilirubin and low platelets are also common in MAHA, but they are not the most specific findings. Haptoglobin is expected to be low in this patient due to the consumption of haptoglobin by free hemoglobin."
