The symptoms and laboratory findings of atypical lymphocytes suggest infectious mononucleosis, which is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. In an immunocompromised host, the Epstein-Barr virus can cause linear ulcers near the lower esophageal sphincter. Multiple cerebral abscesses with surrounding edema and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates with pneumatoceles are more commonly caused by bacterial or fungal infections. Purplish skin nodules on the distal extremities are a manifestation of Kaposi sarcoma, which is commonly seen in HIV-positive patients."

The presence of atypical lymphocytes suggests a viral infection, and the negative heterophile antibody assay and EBV VCA antibodies indicate that it is not mononucleosis. HIV antibody is also negative, ruling out possible immunodeficiency. The mild elevations of ALT and AST suggest liver involvement. Putting all this together, we can infer that the patient has acute hepatitis caused by a viral infection. None of the other options are consistent with the given information."
