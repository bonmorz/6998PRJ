Terbinafine is an antifungal drug used to treat fungal infections, which is the likely cause of the patient\u2019s toenail discoloration and debris. Terbinafine works by inhibiting squalene epoxidase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of fungal cell wall components. By inhibiting this enzyme, terbinafine disrupts the fungal cell membrane and ultimately leads to fungal cell death. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they describe mechanisms of action for other antifungal drugs, such as griseofulvin, azoles, and polyenes, respectively."
