The level of injury is also consistent with this diagnosis (T10 vertebra)."

Brown-Sequard syndrome is characterized by ipsilateral flaccid paralysis and diminished vibratory sense, and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation. This fits with the patient\u2019s symptoms. Option A (Anterior cord syndrome) presents with motor and sensory deficits below the level of the lesion, with preserved proprioception and vibratory sense. Option C (Posterior cord syndrome) presents with loss of proprioception and vibratory sense with intact motor function. Option D (Central cord syndrome) presents with weakness and sensory loss in the upper extremities, but may also involve the lower extremities."
