The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which is caused by a deficiency in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) enzyme. Allopurinol is the medication used to lower uric acid levels by inhibiting xanthine oxidase enzyme. In addition to its action on xanthine oxidase, it also inhibits purine nucleoside phosphorylase, which is involved in the production of hypoxanthine, one of the substrates of HGPRT. Therefore, the inhibition of purine nucleoside phosphorylase helps to reduce the production of uric acid in these patients."
