The symptoms described suggest that the most likely diagnosis is double aortic arch, which compresses the trachea and leads to respiratory symptoms that are worsened by flexion of the neck and improved by extension of the neck. The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms. Laryngomalacia would cause stridor but not wheezing, while congenital subglottic stenosis would cause persistent stridor but not exacerbation of symptoms with feeding, crying, and neck position. Recurrent viral wheeze is a possibility, but it does not explain the vomiting after feeding or the improvement with neck extension."

The symptoms of wheezing exacerbated by crying, feeding, and flexion of the neck, and relieved by extension of the neck, suggest tracheomalacia, which is associated with double aortic arch. Laryngomalacia typically presents with stridor and may be worsened with feeding, but not necessarily crying or neck flexion. Congenital subglottic stenosis would present with stridor but not necessarily wheezing, and is unlikely to be relieved by extension of the neck. Recurrent viral wheeze may be a possibility, but the specific symptoms described in the case make double aortic arch the more likely diagnosis."

The symptoms suggest a condition called vascular ring, which occurs when the aorta and its branches surround and compress the trachea and esophagus. Double aortic arch is the most common type of vascular ring and can cause the recurrent episodes of stridor and wheezing, as well as difficulty in feeding and vomiting. Laryngomalacia may also cause stridor, but is not relieved by extension of the neck. Congenital subglottic stenosis is a narrowing of the trachea and may cause wheezing, but is not exacerbated by crying or feeding. Recurrent viral wheeze is a common cause of wheezing in children, but does not present with the other symptoms mentioned."
