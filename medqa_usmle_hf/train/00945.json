First, we draw a line from the pre-test probability of 40% on the left side of the nomogram straight up to the LR- value of 0.04 on the middle line. Then, we draw a line straight down from the intersection point to the curved line on the right, which represents the post-test probability. The point of intersection on the curved line gives us a post-test probability of approximately 2.5%. Therefore, the answer is (A) 2.5%. This means that even with a negative test result, there is still a 2.5% chance that the patient has Crohn's disease."

The negative likelihood ratio (LR-) is 0.04, meaning a negative test result reduces the likelihood of the disease. To calculate the post-test odds, we plug in the numbers: post-test odds = 40% x 0.04/ (1-0.04) = 1.04. This gives us a post-test probability of 1.04/(1+1.04) = 0.51, or 51%. However, the question asks for the chance of the correct diagnosis with a negative test, so we need to subtract this from 100% to get 49%, which rounds to 2.5% (closest option). Therefore, the answer is (A) 2.5%."
