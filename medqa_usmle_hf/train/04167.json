The symptoms suggest that the patient is experiencing extravasation, which is the leaking of drug solution out of the vein and into the surrounding tissue, leading to tissue injury. The drug works by increasing inositol trisphosphate concentrations in arteriolar smooth muscle cells, so phentolamine is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to prevent further tissue injury by reversing the vasoconstriction caused by the drug. Procaine is a local anesthetic and not indicated in this situation. Conivaptan is a vasopressin antagonist and not indicated. Heparin is an anticoagulant and not indicated in this situation."
