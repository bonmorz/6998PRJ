The patient\u2019s symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain are consistent with a duodenal ulcer. The fact that food ingestion provides relief is also indicative of a duodenal ulcer, as it suggests that the ulcer is located in the duodenal bulb where food neutralizes the acid. The use of over the counter omeprazole also suggests a GI tract issue. Non-bilious vomiting and early satiety are not specific to a duodenal ulcer."

The patient presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and early satiety, suggesting the possibility of a duodenal ulcer. The past relief with omeprazole suggests acid-related disease. The fact that a small meal or snack provides relief indicates that food ingestion provides relief of the symptoms, which is consistent with a duodenal ulcer. The non-bilious vomiting and hypoactive bowel sounds are nonspecific findings. The use of ibuprofen is not suggestive of any specific diagnosis."

Furthermore, non-bilious vomiting is a common symptom of duodenal ulcers. However, omeprazole would not provide immediate relief of symptoms in an acute exacerbation, so option (C) is incorrect. The only option that suggests relief with food ingestion is (D), making it the most consistent with a duodenal ulcer."
