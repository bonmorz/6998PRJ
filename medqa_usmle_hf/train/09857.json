Negative selection is the stage of T-lymphocyte development in which cells that recognize self-antigens with high affinity are eliminated to prevent autoimmune responses. As multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease, it is most likely that the negative selection process is defective, allowing T-cells that target self-antigens to escape elimination and initiate an immune response against myelin sheaths. Positive selection ensures that T-lymphocytes recognize self-antigens with low affinity, while D-J and V-DJ rearrangement contribute to the production of a diverse repertoire of T-cell receptors. While these stages are important for normal T-lymphocyte development and immune function, they are not specifically implicated in autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis."
