The fact that the upper GI bleed has been ruled out with an EGD and the colonoscopy is unremarkable suggests that the lower GI bleed is still ongoing. Technetium-99 labelled erythrocyte scintigraphy is a noninvasive method for localizing these types of bleeds. Nasogastric tube lavage can help diagnose upper GI bleeds, but it has already been ruled out in this case. Ultrasound of the abdomen and CT of the abdomen may show signs of bleeding but are not the most appropriate methods for localizing a lower GI bleed."
