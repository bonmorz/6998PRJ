The sudden, painless, bright red vaginal bleeding in the third trimester with a soft, nontender abdomen and no contractions suggests placenta previa. The presence of blood on the vulva, introitus, and medial aspect of both thighs bilaterally indicates that the blood is coming from the placenta rather than the uterus. Uterine atony would present with a firm, boggy uterus, whereas abruptio placentae would present with painful uterine contractions and often a tender uterus. The absence of contractions also rules out the latent phase of labor."
