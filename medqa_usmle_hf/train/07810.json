The patient presents with severe hyperglycemia and signs of dehydration with low blood pressure, tachycardia, and sunken eyes. The lab results show low serum sodium, normal serum osmolality, and trace ketones in the urine, suggestive of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome (HHNS). The initial treatment is intravenous normal saline infusion to correct the volume depletion, followed by adding potassium to avoid hypokalemia. The insulin infusion should be started after the correction of volume depletion and electrolyte imbalance. Adding dopamine infusion is not necessary in this case, as the patient's blood pressure is already low. Starting basal-bolus insulin is not appropriate as the patient requires continuous insulin infusion. Therefore, the best next step in this patient is adding potassium to the intravenous fluids."
