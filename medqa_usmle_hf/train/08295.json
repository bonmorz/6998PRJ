The patient's symptoms, including headache, chest tightness, and loss of consciousness, are indicative of cholinergic crisis. Irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, which leads to accumulation of acetylcholine at post-junctional receptors, is the mechanism responsible for this crisis. Therefore, option (D) is correct. Competitive inhibition of acetylcholine at post-junctional effector sites is seen in myasthenia gravis. Binding of acetylcholine agonists to post-junctional receptors is the mechanism of action of medications such as Nicotine patches used to help smoking cessation. Inhibition of presynaptic exocytosis of acetylcholine vesicles is seen with medications like Botulinum toxin used in the treatment of chronic migraines."

The patient's symptoms suggest cholinergic crisis, which occurs when there is an accumulation of acetylcholine at post-junctional sites due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine.
