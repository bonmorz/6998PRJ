The patient is presenting symptoms of panic attacks and has had trouble with medication compliance and side effects in the past.

Alprazolam and Buspirone are both medications used to treat anxiety disorders, but given the patient's history, non-pharmaceutical treatment is preferred. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor which is used to treat depression and anxiety disorders, but it may not be the best option as it takes several weeks to take effect and the patient needs immediate relief."
