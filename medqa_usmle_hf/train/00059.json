This is a prospective cohort study as it follows a group of individuals over time and observes the outcome of interest (hospital use) in relation to exposure (patient satisfaction driven healthcare).

Prospective case-control studies start with a disease/outcome and then look for exposure factors. Cross-sectional studies are a snapshot in time of a population and assess both exposure and outcome at the same time."

A prospective cohort study follows a group of individuals over time, with the baseline characteristics and demographics collected at the start. In this case, the study is looking at the outcome of increased hospitalization in relation to the adoption of \"patient satisfaction\" driven healthcare protocols, which is being assessed over a year, indicating a prospective study design. Retrospective case-control studies compare two groups that have already had the outcome of interest (in this case, hospitalization) and are often used to investigate the causes of the outcome. Prospective case-control studies are less common and involve selecting individuals with the outcome of interest and then matching them with individuals without the outcome to see if there are differences in exposure. Cross-sectional studies collect information on one point in time and are useful for identifying prevalence, but not causality."
