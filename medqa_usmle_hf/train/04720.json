The patient\u2019s symptoms and findings are consistent with renal colic, which is caused by a kidney stone obstructing the ureter. The most common type of kidney stone is composed of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate, which is formed when calcium binds with oxalate or phosphate. Both of these substances are poorly absorbed by the intestines and can be excreted in the urine, leading to the formation of kidney stones. However, none of the answer choices are calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate. Lysine is an amino acid that is poorly reabsorbed by the kidneys, and high levels of lysine in the urine can contribute to the formation of kidney stones. Therefore, the patient\u2019s kidney stone may be composed of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate with lysine as an additional component."

Aspartic acid, histidine, and phenylalanine do not have a significant effect on kidney stone formation."
