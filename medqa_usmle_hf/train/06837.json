The patient\u2019s leukocyte count is significantly elevated and the peripheral blood smear shows a majority of neutrophils with band forms and immature and mature neutrophil precursors. These findings are consistent with a leukemoid reaction, which is defined as a peripheral blood leukocyte count higher than 50,000/mm\u00b3 with shift to the left of neutrophilic granulocyte lineage, and reactive basophilia. Acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia are both types of leukemia but with different laboratory findings. Tuberculosis would not lead to these laboratory findings."

The patient has leukocytosis with > 80% neutrophils, which suggests a leukemoid reaction, a reactive increase in white blood cells due to infection or inflammation. The presence of immature neutrophil precursors and increased leukocyte alkaline phosphatase activity support this diagnosis. Acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia typically have blast cells on peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy, which are not present in this case. Tuberculosis may cause weight loss and night sweats, but it is not likely to cause leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance."
