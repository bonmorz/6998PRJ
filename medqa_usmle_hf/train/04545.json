An anterior spinal artery lesion affects the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord, which includes the pathways for pain and temperature sensation, motor function, and proprioception.

Preserved pressure sensation (B) suggests that the posterior column of the spinal cord is preserved, which is consistent with the location of an anterior spinal artery lesion affecting the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord."

The anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord are responsible for motor function and pain and temperature sensation, while the posterior one-third is responsible for proprioception and vibratory sense. Therefore, option (D) is incorrect. Negative plantar extensor response and flaccid paralysis suggest a lower motor neuron lesion, which is not consistent with an anterior spinal artery lesion. Preserved pressure sensation suggests that the posterior columns, which carry the sensation of fine touch, pressure, and vibration, are spared. Thus, the correct answer is (B)."

Based on the given information, the lesion is affecting the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord, which means that it is affecting the blood supply from the anterior spinal artery. This artery supplies the anterior portion of the spinal cord and is responsible for motor function, pain, and temperature sensation. Therefore, loss of pressure sensation (which is supplied by the posterior spinal cord) would not be affected. Negative plantar extensor response indicates an upper motor neuron lesion that occurs above the level of the lesion described. Flaccid paralysis on the right side indicates a lower motor neuron lesion that occurs below the level of the lesion described. Loss of vibratory sense indicates a lesion affecting the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, which is not present in this case. Therefore, preserved pressure sensation is the most likely finding in this scenario."

Since the anterior spinal artery supplies the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord, a lesion in this area would affect the descending motor tracts and the ascending spinothalamic and spinoreticular tracts but not the dorsal columns. This would result in flaccid paralysis on both sides, loss of pain and temperature sensation, preserved pressure sensation, and loss of vibratory sense below the level of the lesion. Therefore, the answer is (B) preserved pressure sensation."

The anterior spinal artery supplies the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord, which includes sensory and motor pathways. Therefore, a finding that suggests damage to the sensory pathway, such as loss of vibratory sense, is not a symptom of an anterior spinal artery lesion. Flaccid paralysis on one side is more suggestive of a lesion in the lateral corticospinal tract. A negative plantar extensor response in the lower limbs would suggest damage to the corticospinal tract, but not necessarily the anterior spinal artery. Preservation of pressure sensation suggests that the posterior columns are not affected, which helps localize the lesion to the anterior two-thirds of the cord supplied by the anterior spinal artery."

Anterior spinal artery syndrome usually causes loss of pain and temperature sensation, motor weakness, and loss of bowel and bladder control. However, pressure and vibratory sensation can remain intact due to the fact that these are transmitted through the posterior columns of the spinal cord, which are not affected by the lesion. Therefore, the correct answer would be (B) preserved pressure sensation. Negative plantar response in lower limbs suggests an upper motor neuron lesion, flaccid paralysis suggests a lower motor neuron lesion, and loss of vibratory sense below the level of the lesion suggests posterior column dysfunction."
