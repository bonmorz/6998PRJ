Coagulative necrosis is usually seen in hypoxic conditions and not related to pancreatitis. Caseous necrosis is usually associated with tuberculosis or fungal infections. Liquefactive necrosis is seen in conditions where there is significant inflammation or infection, but it is not typically associated with acute pancreatitis."
