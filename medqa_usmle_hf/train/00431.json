The patient displays several symptoms of conduct disorder, including defiance, aggression, and disregard for others' feelings. These symptoms may progress to antisocial personality disorder in adulthood, so option C is the most accurate statement. Option A is unlikely, as the patient's behavior is causing difficulties at home and school. Option B is premature, as the patient is still a child and has not been formally diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. Option D is incorrect, as there is no medication specifically indicated for conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder. Behavioral interventions, family therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy are recommended treatments for conduct disorder."

Option A is unlikely as the patient's behavior can lead to negative consequences in the future. Option B is also unlikely to be true as diagnosis of personality disorders requires longer-term patterns of behavior. Option D is incorrect as strong D2 antagonists are not first-line pharmacotherapy for conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder."

Option D is incorrect as pharmacotherapy is not first-line treatment for conduct disorder, but rather behavioral interventions and therapy are typically recommended."
