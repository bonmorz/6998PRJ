The patient's symptoms suggest gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can lead to inflammation of the esophagus. Biopsy of the gastroesophageal junction is taken; this area should have columnar epithelium, which can become metaplastic as a result of GERD. Villi and microvilli, Brunner glands, and Peyer patches are not typically found in the gastroesophageal junction. Furthermore, the fact that chest discomfort worsened with nitroglycerin suggests that this is not angina but rather related to GERD."

The symptoms suggest gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and the biopsy is taken at the gastroesophageal junction, which is where the lower end of the esophagus meets the stomach. GERD can cause esophagitis, which is inflammation and irritation of the esophagus.

Villi and microvilli are found in the small intestine, Brunner glands are found in the duodenum, and Peyer patches are found in the ileum, which are all further downstream from the biopsy location. Sublingual nitroglycerin is expected to relieve chest discomfort in patients with angina or ischemic heart disease, but worsen it in patients with esophageal spasm, which is more commonly associated with GERD."
