The elevated hemoglobin concentration and erythropoietin concentration suggest polycythemia, but the red cell volume is not elevated, which rules out polycythemia vera. Excessive diuretic use can lead to dehydration and hemoconcentration, but the laboratory studies do not show evidence of dehydration. Chronic myelogenous leukemia can cause an elevated white blood cell count, but there is no evidence of this in the laboratory studies. Hepatocellular carcinoma can produce erythropoietin and cause a similar presentation to polycythemia vera."
