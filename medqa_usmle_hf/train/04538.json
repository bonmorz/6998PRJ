This is known as a toxic thyroid nodule or toxic adenoma, and it is caused by a single nodule in the thyroid gland that produces excess thyroid hormone. It is not caused by thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies, thyroglobulin antibodies or activation of oncogenes."

The symptoms and laboratory results suggest that the patient has hyperthyroidism, and the thyroid nodule is likely a hot nodule. Gain-of-function mutations of the TSH receptor are a common cause of hot nodules in hyperthyroidism. Thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies are associated with autoimmune thyroid diseases such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Thyroglobulin antibody production is associated with thyroid cancer. Activation of oncogenes promoting cell division can lead to thyroid cancer, but it is not the most likely mechanism for this patient's hyperthyroidism."

The symptoms and laboratory findings suggest that the patient has a thyroid nodule that is producing excessive amounts of thyroid hormone. The radionuclide scan confirms that the nodule is responsible for the increased uptake and suppression of the surrounding tissue. The most likely mechanism for this is a gain-of-function mutation of the TSH receptor, which can cause autonomous secretion of thyroid hormone. Option A, thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies, is associated with autoimmune thyroiditis. Option C, thyroglobulin antibody production, is seen in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Option D, activation of oncogenes promoting cell division, is associated with thyroid cancer but is less likely in this case as the nodule is benign."
