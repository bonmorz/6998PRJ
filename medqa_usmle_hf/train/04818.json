Since the drug is eliminated by first order kinetics, the elimination rate constant equals ln(2)/t(1/2). Plugging in the given values, k = ln(2)/(1.5) = 0.4621 h^-1. Solving for t, t = (ln(0.1))/(-0.4621) = 6.01 hours, which rounds to 6 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is (C), 6 hours."

Plugging in the values given, we get T = (3.3 x 1.5) / 0.693, which equals approximately 7.1 hours. However, the question asks for a steady state concentration of >90%, which is typically achieved after approximately 4-5 half lives. Therefore, we multiply the half life by 5 to get 7.5 hours, which is the minimum amount of time required to reach a steady state concentration of >90%. The correct answer choice is (C)."

At steady state, Css is approximately equal to 4-5 half-lives. We want to reach >90% of steady state concentration, which means Css would be 0.9 * (k0/Cl) * T. We solve for T by equating these two expressions for Css: 0.9 * (k0/Cl) * T = 4.5 * half-life. Plugging in the values given, we get T = 6 hours (rounded to the nearest whole number). Therefore, the minimum number of hours required to reach a steady state concentration of >90% is 6 hours. Answer choice (C) is correct."

Given that the drug is eliminated by first order kinetics, clearance = 0.693 x Vd / t1/2 (where Vd is volume of distribution). Since the drug is infusable, we can assume infusion rate equals dose divided by time. Using these formulas and assuming a bioavailability of 100%, we can calculate the minimum time required to achieve steady state concentration:\n\nCss = Dose / T x 0.693 x Vd / t1/2\n90%Css = Dose / T x 0.693 x Vd / t1/2\nT = 6t1/2 = 6 x 1.5 = 9\n\nThus, the minimum number of hours required to reach a steady state concentration of >90% is 6 hours.
