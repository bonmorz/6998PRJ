Since peripheral IV access couldn\u2019t be established, the next best option is intraosseous cannulation for quick fluid and medication administration. Intramuscular epinephrine is not the first-line treatment for septic shock, and internal jugular vein cannulation may take too long to establish. Ultrasound-guided antecubital vein cannulation is unreliable in extremely hypotensive patients."
