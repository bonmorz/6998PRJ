The gray, enlarged and nodular appearance of the pancreas with localized calcium deposits is similar to the findings in congenital CMV infection. Primary hyperparathyroidism causes hypercalcemia but does not produce pancreatic changes. Chronic kidney disease may produce mineralization in soft tissues but generally does not cause specific pancreatic changes. Sarcoidosis can lead to hypercalcemia and calcium deposition, but it is not a common cause of pancreatic calcification."
