The small, pale red blood cells seen in the peripheral blood smear suggest microcytic anemia, which is most commonly caused by iron deficiency. Decreased serum haptoglobin concentration is seen in hemolytic anemia, not iron deficiency anemia. Dry bone marrow tap is associated with aplastic anemia, myelofibrosis, and primary myelofibrosis. Increased serum methylmalonic acid concentration is seen in vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. Positive stool guaiac test suggests an underlying gastrointestinal pathology, such as iron-deficiency related gastrointestinal bleeding."
