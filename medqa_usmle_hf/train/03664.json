The symptoms and signs strongly suggest hypoparathyroidism, which can occur after thyroidectomy with central neck dissection due to inadvertent removal or injury of the parathyroid glands. This leads to decreased calcium levels in the blood and subsequent neuromuscular and cardiovascular symptoms. Vitamin D and ionic calcium supplementation can help prevent and treat hypoparathyroidism in this setting. Anticonvulsants and magnesium sulfate may be used to treat seizures associated with hypocalcemia, but do not prevent hypocalcemia. Potassium supplementation is not indicated in this case, as potassium levels are already normal."
