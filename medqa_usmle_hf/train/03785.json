The symptoms and family history suggest a muscular dystrophy, and the genetic study revealing a significant deletion in the gene that codes for dystrophin is highly indicative of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Becker muscular dystrophy also involves dystrophin, but usually has a later onset and milder symptoms. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy have different genetic mutations and clinical presentations."

The symptoms of weakness and delayed motor skills, along with a notable deletion in the gene for dystrophin, suggests Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is the most common type of muscular dystrophy in children. Becker muscular dystrophy is also caused by a dystrophin gene mutation but is less severe and has a later onset than Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy are both different types of muscular dystrophy with distinct clinical features and genetic causes."

The significant deletion in the gene that codes for dystrophin is a characteristic of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which typically presents in early childhood and affects boys more often than girls. Becker muscular dystrophy is a milder form of muscular dystrophy that presents later in childhood or early adulthood. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy also present with weakness, but have different genetic mutations and clinical features."

The symptoms and the genetic study suggest that the boy has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an X-linked recessive disorder that affects primarily males. The deletion in the gene that codes for dystrophin is the most frequent genetic cause of this disease. The onset of symptoms is typically delayed until a child begins walking, which is consistent with the mother's report. The boy's weakness and difficulty walking are also common early symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy."
