The patient is presenting with classic symptoms of possible pulmonary embolism, including shortness of breath, chest pain, positive Homan's sign, and a positive D-dimer result. The CT scan is needed to confirm the diagnosis, and if pulmonary embolism is confirmed, a Greenfield filter would be an ideal treatment to prevent further emboli from traveling to the lungs. Unfractionated heparin and subcutaneous fondaparinux can also be used as anticoagulants in the treatment of pulmonary embolism, but the Greenfield filter is a more effective intervention in this case. Warfarin would not be appropriate for immediate treatment in this situation, as its effects may take several days to reach therapeutic levels."

The patient presents with shortness of breath and chest pain, positive Homan\u2019s sign, and positive D-dimer results, suggesting the possibility of pulmonary embolism. The patient also has a history of a recent hemorrhagic stroke, making anticoagulation therapy a challenging decision due to bleeding risk. A Greenfield filter, also known as an inferior vena cava filter, can be used to prevent pulmonary embolism without increasing the risk of bleeding. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer. Unfractionated heparin, subcutaneous fondaparinux, and warfarin are anticoagulation therapies that increase the risk of bleeding, which is not ideal for patients with a history of hemorrhagic stroke."
