At the current visit, the placental edge is only 1 cm from the internal cervical os, indicating marginal previa. Option (A) is the correct answer as it describes the correct sequence of placental position. Option (B) is incorrect as the placenta was shown to be low-lying at any point. Option (C) is incorrect as it describes a backward progression in placental position, which is not possible. Option (D) is also incorrect as it suggests a low-lying placenta progressing to marginal previa, which is the opposite of what was described."
