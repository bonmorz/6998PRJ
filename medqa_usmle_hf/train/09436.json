The patient's symptoms, including retrosternal chest tightness and shortness of breath with use of morphine suggest a pseudoallergic reaction, possibly due to sensitivity to aspirin. Excessive beta-adrenergic blockade is unlikely as the patient is on a low dose of metoprolol and has a history of hypertension. Alveolar rupture is also unlikely as there are no signs of pneumothorax. Bradykinin-induced bronchial irritation is also unlikely as the patient has a history of asthma, which suggests an allergic component to his respiratory symptoms."

The patient has a history of sensitivity to aspirin and is experiencing symptoms of a pseudoallergic reaction, such as chest tightness, shortness of breath, and flushing.

Alveolar rupture is unlikely given the absence of physical trauma or significant respiratory distress. Bradykinin-induced bronchial irritation is a possible cause of symptoms, but less likely than a pseudoallergic reaction given the patient's history of sensitivity to aspirin."
