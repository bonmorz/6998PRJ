The symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that the patient most likely has measles, which is a common viral infection in Sudan. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare but fatal complication of measles that occurs several years after the initial infection, especially in patients with inadequate immunity. Therefore, this patient is at increased risk of developing SSPE. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura, transient arrest of erythropoiesis, and glomerular immune complex deposition are not associated with measles infection."
