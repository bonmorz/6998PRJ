The photograph shows the typical appearance of razor bumps, also known as pseudofolliculitis barbae, which is caused by interfollicular penetration of the skin by the distal end of the hair. Trichophyton is a fungus that causes infections of the skin, hair, and nails. Cutibacterium acnes, formerly called Propionibacterium acnes, is a normal resident of the pilosebaceous unit and can cause acne. Follicular obstruction with subsequent duct rupture can lead to folliculitis or abscess formation."
