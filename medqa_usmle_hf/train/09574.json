The symptoms of lethargy, fatigue, pale skin, and constipation suggest iron-deficiency anemia, which can be caused by impaired heme synthesis. The presence of sideroblasts in the blood smear indicates that the heme synthesis pathway is affected. The scheme presented shows the steps of heme synthesis. Ferrochelatase, labeled no. 1, is the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of heme synthesis, which is the insertion of iron into protoporphyrin IX to form heme. Therefore, impairment of ferrochelatase would lead to a buildup of protoporphyrin IX, which would cause symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia."

The scheme presented shows the heme synthesis pathway. Ferrochelatase is responsible for incorporating iron into protoporphyrin, which is the last step of heme synthesis. A deficiency in this enzyme would lead to an accumulation of protoporphyrin, which can cause the symptoms seen in this patient. The other enzymes labeled in the scheme are not associated with symptoms in this scenario."
