The patient\u2019s low hemoglobin and erythrocyte count, along with a normal leukocyte count, suggest a diagnosis of anemia.

Before ordering a bone marrow biopsy, which is invasive and more costly, a simple reticulocyte count can help to confirm the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia. Therefore, (B) Reticulocyte count is the best next step in the management of this patient\u2019s condition."

The patient is presenting with symptoms of anemia, which is supported by the laboratory results showing low hemoglobin and erythrocyte count. The MCV and MCH are normal, indicating a normocytic, normochromic anemia. The most appropriate next step is to assess the reticulocyte count to determine if the anemia is due to decreased production of red blood cells or increased destruction. A low reticulocyte count would suggest decreased production, while a high reticulocyte count would suggest increased destruction. Options A, C, and D are not indicated at this point in the evaluation of the patient's anemia."

The high MCV and MCH suggest a macrocytic anemia, which can be caused by vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency. The best next step is to order a reticulocyte count to determine if the anemia is regenerative or nonregenerative. A regenerative anemia would suggest a deficiency in a nutrient that is required for erythropoiesis, such as vitamin B12 or folate. If the reticulocyte count is nonregenerative, then further evaluation for a bone marrow disorder would be warranted, such as a bone marrow biopsy. A serum ferritin level would help to evaluate for iron deficiency anemia but would not be the best initial test given the patient\u2019s findings. A direct antiglobulin test would not be helpful in this case."
