The patient is presenting with symptoms of mitral stenosis, which is confirmed by the opening snap before S2 and diastolic decrescendo murmur best heard at the apex. The ECG shows atrial fibrillation, which is common in mitral stenosis. Beta-blockers are the prefered drug for rate control in this case, as they decrease the heart rate by blocking the action of adrenaline. Balloon commissurotomy may be considered in selected cases, warfarin should be used for thromboembolism prophylaxis, and antidiuretic therapy might be necessary in cases of heart failure or pulmonary edema, but none of these options are the correct first step in management in this case."

The patient is presenting with symptoms and examination findings consistent with mitral stenosis, indicated by the opening snap before S2 and the diastolic decrescendo murmur best heard at the apex. The ECG also shows atrial fibrillation, which is a common complication of mitral stenosis. Based on the patient's gestational age, balloon commissurotomy may carry an unacceptable risk to both the patient and the fetus. Warfarin is contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy, and antidiuretic therapy is not indicated in this case. Beta-blockers are the drug class of choice for rate control in this case, as they are safe to use during pregnancy and can help prevent tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy."

The correct management includes rate control with beta-blockers to prevent tachycardia and decrease cardiac workload. Balloon commissurotomy and antidiuretic therapy are not typically used in the management of mitral stenosis in pregnancy. Warfarin is contraindicated in pregnancy as it can cause fetal abnormalities. Instead, anticoagulation therapy with heparin may be used for thromboembolism prophylaxis."
