The patient's lack of immunity to varicella zoster virus and exposure to chickenpox puts her at risk for developing varicella infection during pregnancy, which can lead to complications such as congenital varicella syndrome. The most appropriate next step in management is administration of varicella zoster immune globulin to provide passive immunity and reduce the risk of varicella infection. Varicella vaccine is contraindicated during pregnancy, and reassurance or ganciclovir therapy are not appropriate management options."
