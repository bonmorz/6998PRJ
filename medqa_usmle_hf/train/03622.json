The patient presents with a left orbital floor fracture, which can cause restricted ocular motility and enophthalmos (displacement of the eyeball into the orbit).

MRI is not necessary for the diagnosis and management of this patient. The chance of spontaneous improvement of ocular motility is unknown and may be influenced by the size and location of the fracture. Surgical intervention is not immediately necessary in this case, as the fracture is small and not causing significant displacement. However, if there is evidence of worsening ocular motility or enophthalmos, surgical intervention may be necessary."
