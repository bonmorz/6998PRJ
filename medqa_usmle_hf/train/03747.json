The patient is presenting with symptoms of an acute asthma attack, as evidenced by difficulty breathing, decreased pulmonary function tests, and low oxygen saturation.

Albuterol can also be used as a second-line treatment, but epinephrine is preferred for initial treatment in severe cases. Intubation may be needed in severe cases where the patient is not responding to treatment, but it is not the best initial treatment. Prednisone is an oral corticosteroid that is typically used to prevent future asthma attacks, but it is not the best initial treatment for an acute attack."
