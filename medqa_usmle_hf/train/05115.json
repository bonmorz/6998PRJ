The toxin produced by the pathologic organism (Corynebacterium diphtheriae) inhibits eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2), leading to protein synthesis inhibition and cell death. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. ADP-ribosylation factor 6 is involved in vesicular trafficking, Desmoglein is a component of cell-to-cell junctions, and RNA polymerase II is involved in transcription, none of which are related to diphtheria."

The gray, thick membrane covering the tonsils suggests that the target of the virulence factor produced by this organism is eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2). This protein is responsible for protein synthesis and is essential for the survival of eukaryotic cells.
