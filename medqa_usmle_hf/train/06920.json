The symptoms, synovial fluid aspiration, and gram stain suggest the presence of a joint infection caused by gram-negative rods, most likely an Enterobacteriaceae.

IV nafcillin is not appropriate as it does not cover gram-negative pathogens and is not effective in treating joint infections. IV ceftazidime and gentamicin may be effective, but cefepime provides broader coverage and is a better choice."
