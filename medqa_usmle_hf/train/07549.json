The patient's symptoms indicate benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and the smooth, severely enlarged prostate without nodules suggests BPH-related bladder outlet obstruction. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, such as finasteride and dutasteride, reduce the size of the prostate by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which plays a major role in the development and progression of BPH. Alpha-1-adrenergic antagonists, such as terazosin and tamsulosin, relax the smooth muscle in the prostate and improve urine flow, but do not reduce the size of the prostate. Anticholinergics, such as oxybutynin and solifenacin, are used to treat overactive bladder symptoms but are not effective for BPH-related urinary symptoms. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil and tadalafil, are used to treat erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension, but are not effective for BPH-related urinary symptoms."
