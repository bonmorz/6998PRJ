The symptoms suggest the patient has tetanus, which is caused by the Clostridium tetani bacteria that produces tetanospasmin, a neurotoxin that affects the release of the neurotransmitter glycine.

The symptoms described suggest the patient is experiencing malignant hyperthermia, a rare but potentially life-threatening reaction to anesthesia or certain medications. This reaction is triggered by an abnormal release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle cells, which leads to sustained muscle contraction and increased metabolic demand. Glycine is a neurotransmitter that acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and plays a role in regulating skeletal muscle function. In cases of malignant hyperthermia, the abnormal release of calcium can disrupt glycine receptor function and contribute to skeletal muscle rigidity and increased reflexes."

The symptoms described suggest the patient is experiencing symptoms of tetanus, which is caused by a toxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium tetani. The toxin affects glycine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, causing muscle rigidity and increased reflexes. Diazepam can help treat muscle spasms experienced by the patient. Metronidazole is an antibiotic used to treat the infection caused by the bacteria. Immunoglobulin provides passive immunity against the toxin produced by the bacteria. Acetylcholine is involved in muscle contraction and is affected in myasthenia gravis. Dopamine and serotonin are involved in mood regulation and are not the primary neurotransmitters affected in tetanus."
