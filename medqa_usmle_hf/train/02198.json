The next best step would be to discontinue glipizide and initiate insulin glargine 10 units at bedtime. Glipizide is a sulfonylurea that promotes insulin release from the pancreas, but its effectiveness decreases over time. Insulin glargine is a long-acting basal insulin that can provide more consistent control of blood glucose levels. Discontinuing metformin is not appropriate as it is a first-line medication for type 2 diabetes. Discontinuing sitagliptin is also not a preferred option as it has a low risk of hypoglycemia and can be used in combination with insulin. Basal-bolus insulin therapy is a more advanced treatment and may not be necessary for this patient at this time."
