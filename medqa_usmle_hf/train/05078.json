This condition is inherited as an autosomal dominant mutation, with impaired erythropoiesis leading to macrocytic red blood cells without hypersegmented neutrophils. Children who survive may present with short stature and craniofacial abnormalities. Splenectomy is not a treatment option for this condition. Diamond-Blackfan anemia is not caused by an inability to convert orotic acid to UMP nor by a defect in lymphoblasts and erythroid progenitor cells.

The symptoms described in the question suggest that the patient has Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA), which is a rare kind of anemia. However, none of the answer choices entirely match with the characteristics of DBA. DBA is an inherited condition characterized by a shortage of red blood cells, which leads to a risk of developing severe anemia. One of the true statements about this condition is that fetal hemoglobin levels are elevated in patients with DBA. Treatment options for DBA include corticosteroids and blood transfusions, but splenectomy is not a treatment option. The condition is not due to an inability to convert orotic acid to UMP, nor due to a defect in lymphoblasts and erythroid progenitor cells."
