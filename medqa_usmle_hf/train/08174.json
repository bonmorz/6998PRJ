The symptoms, including perineal hypesthesia, urinary incontinence, and absence of anal sphincter contraction, suggest damage to the sacral spinal cord. Option B, absent reflex erection, is consistent with spinal cord involvement at the S2-S4 levels, which can also affect the bladder and anal sphincter. Paralysis of hip adductors and impaired hip flexion are indicative of damage at the L2-L4 levels, while impaired psychogenic erection is related to damage to the upper lumbar spinal cord or higher cortical centers, which are not likely to be affected in this case."
