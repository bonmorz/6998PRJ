When the body is in a state of starvation, the liver produces ketones such as \u00df-hydroxybutyric acid to provide energy to the brain. Glucose-6-phosphate is involved in glucose metabolism and glycogen is a storage form of glucose that can be broken down into glucose when needed, but in this case, the body is in a state of starvation and glucose levels are low. Fatty acids can be used as an energy source during starvation, but they cannot cross the blood-brain barrier to provide energy to the brain, which relies mainly on glucose or ketones."

During prolonged fasting or starvation, the liver produces ketone bodies (including \u00df-hydroxybutyric acid) as an alternative source of energy for the brain.

Fatty acids are also released and used for energy, but they cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Glucose-6-phosphate and glycogen are used as sources of glucose, but the body tries to preserve glucose for other cells during starvation, so it is unlikely that the liver is releasing glucose into the bloodstream during a hunger strike."
