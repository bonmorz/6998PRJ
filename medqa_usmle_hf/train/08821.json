A 95% CI means that if the study were to be repeated many times, we can be 95% confident that the true value falls within the range of the CI. Option (A) is incorrect, as it states that chance would not produce the difference shown, which is not what a CI represents. Option (B) is incorrect, as it refers to a confidence interval for the estimated difference containing 0, but the question does not mention this situation. Option (D) is incorrect, as the confidence level of 95% is a standard in statistical analysis and not chosen by the researcher."
