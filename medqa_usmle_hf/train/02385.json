The symptoms, including loss of consciousness, sustained rhythmic contractions of all extremities, and low glucose level, suggest hypoglycemia. The fact that the patient has no history of diabetes and a low C-peptide level raises suspicion for surreptitious insulin use. Beta cell tumor is unlikely as there is no evidence of hyperinsulinism. Diabetic ketoacidosis and surreptitious sulfonylurea use can cause hypoglycemia, but they are less likely given the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory values."

The family history of type 1 diabetes mellitus is not relevant to this diagnosis. Beta cell tumor would cause hyperinsulinemia and increased C-peptide levels. Diabetic ketoacidosis is characterized by hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis, which are not present in this case. Surreptitious sulfonylurea use would also cause hypoglycemia, but the low C-peptide level suggests exogenous insulin use."

Beta cell tumor is unlikely as there is no indication of insulin production being too high. Diabetic ketoacidosis is also unlikely as the patient has low glucose levels. Surreptitious sulfonylurea use is a possibility, but the low C-peptide levels indicate that this is not the case."
