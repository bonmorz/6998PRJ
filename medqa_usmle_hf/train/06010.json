Isosorbide mononitrate is a nitrate drug that leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains in venous smooth muscle cells. It is used to treat angina and heart failure. Nitroglycerin is another nitrate drug that is used to treat angina but it acts primarily on arteries rather than veins. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that acts on vascular smooth muscle and is used to treat hypertension and angina. Nitroprusside is a potent vasodilator that is used in hypertensive emergencies but it acts on both arteries and veins, leading to more potent arterial vasodilation. Thus, the most likely drug the patient ingested is Isosorbide mononitrate."

Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker and does not act on myosin light chains in smooth muscle cells.
