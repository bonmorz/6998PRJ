Ganciclovir is an antiviral that inhibits viral DNA synthesis, which is important to stop the spread of the disease. If the patient is still experiencing symptoms after a few days, it is likely that the CMV is resistant to ganciclovir and a medication that inhibits nucleic acid synthesis, such as foscarnet, should be used instead."

Ganciclovir is used to inhibit viral DNA synthesis, but the patient is still symptomatic which suggests that the viral DNA synthesis is not completely inhibited. Foscarnet, the medication the patient is switched to, inhibits viral DNA polymerase and is effective against ganciclovir-resistant viruses. Therefore, nucleic acid synthesis is the process inhibited by Foscarnet."

The initial treatment with ganciclovir, which inhibits viral DNA synthesis, did not work, so a different medication targeting the same pathway is needed. Therefore, the newly added medication also targets nucleic acid synthesis. Answer choice (A) is incorrect because ganciclovir already targets viral penetration into host cells. Answer choice (C) is incorrect because the patient is not experiencing progeny virus release (which refers to the release of new virions from infected cells), but rather an active viral infection within the retina. Answer choice (D) is incorrect because ganciclovir already targets viral uncoating."
