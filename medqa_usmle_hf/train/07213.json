The table shows that the urinary PAH concentration increases with the plasma PAH concentration up to a certain point, but then plateaus. This is likely due to saturation of the PAH transport carriers in the proximal tubules, which are responsible for actively moving PAH from the blood into the tubules for excretion. As the plasma concentration of PAH continues to increase, the transporters become saturated and the rate of excretion plateaus. Increased diffusion rate (B) would not explain this phenomenon, nor would decreased glomerular filtration (C) or increased flow rate of tubular contents (D)."

The table above shows that as plasma PAH concentration increases beyond 20 mg/dL, urinary PAH concentration plateaus and does not increase proportionally. This suggests saturation of PAH transport carriers, meaning that there are a limited number of transporters that can carry PAH and they become saturated at higher concentrations. Increased diffusion rate, decreased filtration, and increased flow rate do not explain this plateau."

The table shows that as plasma PAH concentration increases, urinary PAH concentration also increases until it reaches a plateau at 30-40 mg/dL.

The table shows that as the plasma PAH concentration increases, the urinary PAH concentration also increases until the plasma concentration reaches 20 mg/dL. After that point, the urinary PAH concentration does not increase proportionally with the plasma PAH concentration. This suggests that the transport carriers for PAH are saturated, meaning that they are already at their maximum capacity for transporting PAH. Therefore, the best explanation for the decrease in PAH excretion with a plasma concentration greater than 20 mg/dL is saturation of the transport carriers. Increased diffusion rate would result in increased excretion, not decreased. Decreased glomerular filtration would affect all substances, not just PAH. Increased flow rate would increase excretion proportionally with plasma concentration."

The table demonstrates that as plasma PAH concentration increases, urinary PAH concentration also increases, until it reaches a plateau around 150-180 mg/dL. This suggests that the transport carriers responsible for moving PAH into the tubules become saturated at higher plasma concentrations. This mechanism is known as carrier-mediated transport. Therefore, (A) - saturation of PAH transport carriers - best explains the decrease in PAH excretion at higher plasma concentrations. Option (B) - increased diffusion rate of PAH - does not make sense as PAH is not normally transported by diffusion. Option (C) - decreased glomerular filtration of PAH - is incorrect because PAH is actively filtered at the glomerulus, and would not be affected by decreased filtration. Option (D) - increased flow rate of tubular contents - would not cause a decrease in PAH excretion."

Option B is incorrect, as the diffusion rate is not affected by changes in plasma concentration. Option C is also incorrect, as there is no evidence of decreased glomerular filtration.
