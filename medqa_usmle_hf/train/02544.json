The patient has intermittent lower abdominal cramps associated with diarrhea, bloating, and mild nausea, and a 5-kg weight loss, which are consistent with Crohn disease. The barium enema findings also indicate Crohn disease rather than Ulcerative colitis, which is limited to the colon. Celiac disease is associated with weight loss, but it does not typically cause ulceration or narrowing of the colon. Intestinal carcinoid tumors would not cause the specific symptoms described in the case."

The patient presents with symptoms of Crohn\u2019s disease, including intermittent lower abdominal cramps associated with diarrhea, bloating, and mild nausea. The weight loss and difficulty in fully emptying bowels further support the diagnosis. The barium enema shows ulceration and narrowing of the right colon, which is consistent with Crohn\u2019s disease. Ulcerative colitis typically involves the rectum and spreads proximally, while Crohn\u2019s disease can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. Celiac disease typically presents with malabsorption and a high-fiber diet is not a risk factor. Intestinal carcinoid tumors usually present with flushing and diarrhea, which are not present in this case."
