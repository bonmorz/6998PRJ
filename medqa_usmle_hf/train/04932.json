The described breathing technique is known as the Valsalva maneuver, which can have various effects on cardiovascular parameters. In particular, it is expected to increase intrathoracic pressure, decrease venous return, and decrease left ventricular stroke volume. Therefore, the most likely effect after 10 seconds in this position is decreased left ventricular stroke volume. Option A is incorrect because Valsalva maneuver is expected to increase systemic vascular resistance. Option C is incorrect because Valsalva maneuver is expected to increase intra-abdominal pressure. Option D is incorrect because Valsalva maneuver can either increase or decrease pulse rate, depending on various factors."
