Gentamicin may cause hearing loss but not the other symptoms. Omeprazole is a proton-pump inhibitor and is not associated with the symptoms observed. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol syndrome, which may cause similar symptoms, but the presence of cataracts suggests that warfarin exposure is the most likely cause in this case."
