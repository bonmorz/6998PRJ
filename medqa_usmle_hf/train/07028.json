The symptoms, including increased daytime somnolence, paralysis upon waking from naps, and visual hallucinations, suggest the most likely diagnosis is narcolepsy. The standard pharmacotherapy for narcolepsy is stimulants, such as amphetamines and methylphenidate, which can cause cardiac irregularities, nervousness, and hallucinations as side effects. Parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia are side effects of antipsychotic medications. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a side effect of some diuretic medications. Weight gain and metabolic syndrome are side effects of some antipsychotic and mood stabilizing medications."
