The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for GDM is insulin. Insulin binds to tyrosine kinase receptors and activates them, which in turn leads to increased glucose uptake by cells and decreased blood glucose levels. Therefore, the correct answer is (B). The other options are mechanisms of action for different types of medications used for treating diabetes, but they are not appropriate for GDM."

Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is the mechanism of action of sitagliptin, which is used to treat type 2 diabetes. Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma is the mechanism of action of thiazolidinediones, which are also used to treat type 2 diabetes. Opening of ATP-dependent K+ channels is the mechanism of action of sulfonylureas, which are not recommended for use in pregnancy."
