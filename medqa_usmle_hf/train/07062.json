Physiologic anemia occurs in pregnancy but usually occurs later in the pregnancy and should have higher MCV values. The fetus should not be affected by iron deficiency anemia until later in the pregnancy when iron stores are depleted. Folate deficiency anemia has similar symptoms but should have a higher MCV. Pernicious anemia is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency and usually does not occur in pregnancy since prenatal vitamins contain adequate amounts of B12."

Physiologic anemia of pregnancy usually occurs around 20-24 weeks gestation and would not be severe enough to cause symptoms at 12 weeks. Folate deficiency anemia and pernicious anemia would have elevated MCV. The normal Hb levels in the fetus suggest that the fetus is not affected by the mother's anemia. However, it is important to monitor the mother's anemia and provide appropriate treatment to prevent potential fetal complications."

Physiologic anemia is common during pregnancy, but it typically does not manifest until the second or third trimester. Folate deficiency anemia would be characterized by macrocytosis (elevated MCV), which is not seen in this patient. Pernicious anemia is a type of vitamin B12 deficiency, which is not indicated by the CBC results. It is important to note that the fetal hematologic state is typically separate from the maternal state, and the question does not provide sufficient information to definitively determine the fetal hematologic state. However, if there is maternal iron deficiency anemia, the fetus may also be at risk of iron deficiency due to reduced transplacental transfer of iron."

The fetus may not have anemia at this point, but the mother's anemia could lead to complications during pregnancy and delivery. Option A is incorrect because folate deficiency anemia usually has a normal MCV. Option C is unlikely because pernicious anemia is rare in young women and fetal Hb levels are often affected. Option D is incorrect because physiologic anemia is common in pregnancy but usually occurs in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, not at 12 weeks."

The MCV is low, which points more towards iron deficiency anemia than folate deficiency anemia. Since the patient is pregnant and the fetus relies on maternal Hb levels for oxygenation, the most likely hematologic state for the fetus is normal Hb levels. Pernicious anemia is unlikely since it is more commonly seen in older adults and physiologic anemia is a term used to describe the normal decrease in Hb levels during pregnancy, but it does not explain the low Hb and hematocrit values in this patient."

Folate deficiency anemia and pernicious anemia have different lab findings. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer. The anemia is mild, so oral iron supplementation can be recommended for the mother."
