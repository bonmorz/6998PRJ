Her distress and difficulty sleeping support a diagnosis of a mental disorder, but the symptoms are not severe enough to suggest major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. The symptoms are also not consistent with the repetitive, intrusive thoughts and behaviors of obsessive-compulsive disorder."
