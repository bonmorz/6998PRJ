Aminoglycoside toxicity usually causes vertical nystagmus, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo often causes brief, intense nystagmus when the patient changes head position, and Meniere disease typically causes a slow-phase, beating nystagmus that lasts for minutes."

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo causes brief bouts of vertigo and nystagmus with a characteristic pattern that changes with head position. Meniere disease causes recurrent episodes of vertigo with tinnitus and hearing loss, but the nystagmus is not horizontal."
