The described defect is a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which causes increased blood flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle. This increased flow leads to increased pressure in the right ventricle and lungs, causing the symptoms described. After successful repair of the defect, there will be a decrease in left-to-right shunting and a subsequent decrease in right ventricular pressure, leading to a decrease in overall pulmonary vascular resistance. As a result, there will be a decrease in left atrial pressure, as the blood is now flowing primarily to the left side of the heart. However, there will initially be an increase in left ventricular pressure, as the left ventricle adjusts to the decreased volume of blood in the right ventricle. Therefore, the correct answer is (B): \u2193 left atrial pressure, \u2191 left ventricular pressure, and \u2193 right ventricular pressure."
