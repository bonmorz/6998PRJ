The increased laxity of the right knee joint when the knee is flexed to 30\u00b0 and an abducting force is applied to the lower leg suggests damage to the medial collateral ligament (MCL). The other options are not associated with this specific type of instability. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and lateral meniscus are more commonly associated with posterior instability and rotational instability, respectively. The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) may cause varus instability."
