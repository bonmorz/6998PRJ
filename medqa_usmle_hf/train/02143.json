Hereditary spherocytosis is a chronic hemolytic anemia characterized by the formation of spherocytes, which are more prone to hemolysis than normal red blood cells. As a result, patients with this disease are at high risk for infection, especially from encapsulated organisms like Streptococcus pneumoniae. Daily penicillin prophylaxis is therefore recommended to prevent bacterial infections due to encapsulated organisms. Vaccine against hepatitis B virus is a recommended vaccination for patients with splenectomy, but it is not the most appropriate recommendation for preventing morbidity and mortality in this case. Warfarin and hydroxyurea are not indicated for this patient."
