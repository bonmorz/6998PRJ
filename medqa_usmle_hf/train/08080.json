The physical examination findings suggest that the boy has a limp and his left pelvis sags when he stands only on his right leg. The most likely cause of these findings is damage to the right superior gluteal nerve, which supplies the gluteus medius and minimus muscles that are responsible for stabilizing the pelvis during single leg stance. The other options mentioned are less likely to be the cause of these specific findings."
