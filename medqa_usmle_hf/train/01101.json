The symptoms described suggest a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, which is characterized by a bimanual, rhythmic, low-frequency tremor, slow movements, and a shuffling gait. The most likely underlying cause of Parkinson's disease is neuronal degeneration due to \u03b1-synuclein protein misfolding. Copper accumulation due to mutations in hepatocyte copper-transporting ATPase can cause Wilson's disease, which can also present with neurological symptoms, but typically presents at a younger age with liver involvement as well. Cerebellar ischemia due to chronic hypertension can cause ataxia and other cerebellar findings, but not Parkinsonian symptoms. Proliferation of beta-adrenergic receptors from excessive circulating T4 can cause tremor and other symptoms, but not Parkinsonian symptoms."
