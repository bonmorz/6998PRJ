The patient's symptoms of chest pain and food sticking in her chest while eating, along with the esophagogram results, suggest the most likely diagnosis is achalasia, which is characterized by failed relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and impaired peristalsis of the esophagus. Simultaneous multi-peak contractions on manometry would be consistent with this diagnosis. Elevated lower esophageal sphincter pressure would suggest a different diagnosis, such as diffuse esophageal spasm. A gastroesophageal junction mass would not cause the symptoms described, but would be seen on endoscopy. Hypertensive contractions on manometry would suggest nutcracker esophagus."
