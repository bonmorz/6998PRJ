Abdominal CT may be performed afterwards for further evaluation. Diagnostic laparoscopy or emergency laparotomy may be necessary if there is clear evidence of intra-abdominal bleeding or organ injury."

Given the mechanism of injury and the physical findings, the most likely diagnosis is internal bleeding. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the bleeding. CT may also be used, but it is less sensitive than DPL in detecting small amounts of blood. Diagnostic laparoscopy and emergency laparotomy can be considered if DPL is inconclusive or if there is evidence of significant bleeding."
