However, her PTH level is only slightly elevated and her urine calcium excretion is low, suggesting a mild form of the disease. As she is asymptomatic, the next best step in the management of this patient is to monitor her serum calcium level and repeat PTH level in 6 months to 1 year. No treatment is necessary at this time. Giving IV fluids or pamidronate is not indicated as she is not symptomatic and her urine calcium excretion is low. Glucocorticoids are not used in the management of hyperparathyroidism."

Therefore, the next best step is to monitor her and observe without treatment. IV fluids would not be necessary if the patient is not dehydrated. Pamidronate is used for hypercalcemia of malignancy, not for primary hyperparathyroidism. Glucocorticoids are used to treat hypercalcemia associated with granulomatous disorders."

Therefore, (B) is the correct answer. Starting IV fluids or giving glucocorticoids is not indicated in this case. Pamidronate is a bisphosphonate used to treat hypercalcemia, but it is not indicated in this case as the patient is asymptomatic and does not have severe hypercalcemia."

Starting IV fluids, giving glucocorticoids or starting on pamidronate are not indicated at this point."
