The fact that the patient has a history of anemia with target cells suggests a possible diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. The presence of a single point mutation suggests a mutation in a single nucleotide in the gene. Exons are regions of the gene that code for amino acids, so a mutation in the exon can lead to the absence or alteration of an amino acid sequence. Intron, Kozak consensus sequence, and transcriptional promoter regions do not code for amino acid sequences, so a mutation in these regions would not directly affect the amino acid sequence of the protein."

The symptoms and physical exam findings suggest cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, which often presents with right upper quadrant pain worsened by eating and a positive Murphy's sign. The mutation described is a frameshift mutation, which would cause a change in the amino acid sequence and is more likely to occur in an exon of the affected gene. Intron mutations may affect splicing but are less likely to cause a frameshift mutation. Kozak consensus sequence and transcriptional promoters are not related to frameshift mutations."

The question describes a genetic mutation that results in the loss of a specific sequence of amino acids in the protein encoded by the affected gene.
