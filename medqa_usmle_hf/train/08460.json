The history and symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of hypercalcemia due to malignancy, with the lung mass being a potential source of the calcium. The first step in management is to address the dehydration caused by the constipation and potential kidney damage due to kidney stones. This can be done by administering intravenous fluids. Options A and B are both used to treat osteoporosis and would not be applicable in this scenario. Furosemide may worsen calcium excretion and would not be the first step in management."

The patient's history and lab values suggest hypercalcemia, which can be caused by various conditions including lung cancer.

Alendronate and calcitonin may be used to treat osteoporosis and hypercalcemia caused by other conditions but may not be effective in this situation. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that can help remove excess fluid and lower calcium levels but is not the first step in management."
