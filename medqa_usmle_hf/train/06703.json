The woman is demonstrating reaction formation, which is a defense mechanism where a person behaves in a way opposite to their true feelings in order to avoid facing those feelings. In this case, her derogatory comments may be a way for her to distance herself from her own same-sex attraction. Acting out involves expressing negative emotions through impulsive behavior, sexualization involves making everything about sex, and intellectualization involves using logic and rationalization to avoid emotional issues. None of these are applicable to the given scenario."

Acting out involves impulsively acting on thoughts or feelings without considering the consequences. Sexualization involves unconsciously making sexual issues the focus of one's life. Intellectualization involves avoiding emotions by focusing on logic and reason. None of these defense mechanisms fit the woman's behavior as described in the question."

Reaction formation is a defense mechanism where a person unconsciously replaces anxiety-provoking or threatening emotions with their opposite. In this case, the woman's frequent sexual fantasies about female coworkers may provoke anxiety or conflict with her beliefs, so she replaces them with derogatory comments about same-sex couples to maintain a sense of control and conformity. Acting out is a defense mechanism where a person acts impulsively on their emotions rather than dealing with them directly. Sexualization refers to the objectification of oneself or others as sexual objects, which is not necessarily relevant in this scenario. Intellectualization is a defense mechanism where a person focuses on rational thinking and abstract ideas to avoid emotional discomfort."

Acting out involves engaging in impulsive or inappropriate behaviors, sexualization involves viewing oneself or others primarily in terms of sexual attractiveness, and intellectualization involves using intellectual reasoning to distance oneself from emotional responses."
