IL-1 is a cytokine involved in the inflammatory response and is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of gouty arthritis. It stimulates the production of other cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, which contribute to the inflammation and pain associated with gout. IL-10, INF\u03b3, and IL-5 are not typically associated with gouty arthritis."
