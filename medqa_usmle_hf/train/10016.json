The patient has a history of gestational diabetes (having given birth to a child with a birth weight > 4 kg) and is overweight. Therefore, a glucose oral tolerance test is indicated to screen for gestational diabetes, which is more common among overweight or obese women and those who have had a previous large baby. Serology for CMV may be indicated for pregnant women with a history of exposure or symptoms suggestive of infection. Coagulogram and liver enzyme assessment are not routine tests for prenatal care unless there are specific indications."
