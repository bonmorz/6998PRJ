The patient has HIV infection and a history of intravenous illicit drug use, which puts him at high risk for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). The symptoms, chest x-ray findings, and lymphocyte-predominant pleural effusion with high adenosine deaminase support the diagnosis of TB rather than other options. Rheumatoid arthritis is not related to the patient's symptoms, and pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia typically presents with nonproductive cough and dyspnea rather than productive cough and chest pain. Lung cancer is less likely given the patient's young age and nonsmoker status."

The patient is HIV-positive and has symptoms of pneumonia with a left-sided pleural effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy. The pleural fluid analysis shows high adenosine deaminase activity, which is a characteristic of tuberculosis. The patient's history of intravenous drug use and staying at a homeless shelter also increase the likelihood of tuberculosis. Rheumatoid arthritis and lung cancer are unlikely diagnoses in this case, and although Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-positive patients, the presentation is not consistent with this condition."

The patient is immunocompromised due to his HIV infection and has a history of intravenous illicit drug use, putting him at risk for pulmonary tuberculosis.
