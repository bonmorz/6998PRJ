The symptoms and the scarlatiniform rash with flaccid blisters that rupture easily are indicative of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. This syndrome is caused by an exfoliative toxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus, which causes the skin to peel off in sheets. Toxic epidermal necrolysis would cause large areas of skin to peel, but it would not present with a scarlatiniform rash. Toxic shock syndrome would present with fever, rash, and hypotension but would not cause the specific type of rash seen in this patient. Urticaria would present with hives, which are not described in this patient's rash."
