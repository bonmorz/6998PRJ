Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast that also causes pneumonia, but it grows on Sabouraud agar, which contains glucose and peptone. Bordetella pertussis is a bacterial cause of pertussis (whooping cough), and Coxiella burnetii is a bacterial cause of Q fever, neither of which are likely in this case."
