The patient has taken an overdose of pain medication, based on the history of a suicide attempt, and is current experiencing symptoms of toxicity including nausea, dizziness, and confusion.

Aspirin is the only option among the answer choices that is known to cause metabolic acidosis. Acetaminophen toxicity is more commonly associated with liver damage and does not typically cause metabolic acidosis. Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant medication, neither of which are known to cause metabolic acidosis in the setting of overdose."
