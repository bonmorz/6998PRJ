The multiple features that the patient exhibits suggest that he may have Fragile X syndrome, which is a genetic condition caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene. Southern blot with DNA probes is the most specific test to diagnose Fragile X syndrome as it can detect changes in the gene's DNA sequence. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is a method to separate and identify proteins, PCR followed by northern blot with DNA probes is used to detect RNA sequences, and Western blot is used to detect specific proteins in a sample. These tests are not relevant to the diagnosis of Fragile X syndrome."
