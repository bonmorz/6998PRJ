The symptoms described are consistent with methylmalonic acidemia, which is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme mutase, which is responsible for converting methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA in the mitochondria. This deficiency leads to a buildup of methylmalonic acid, resulting in acidosis and other symptoms.
