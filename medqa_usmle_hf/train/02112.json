The patient\u2019s occasional milk discharge from both breasts indicates a prolactinoma, a non-cancerous tumor of the pituitary gland that produces high levels of prolactin. Prolactin inhibits the secretion of FSH and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone, which interfere with ovulation and may lead to infertility. The patient\u2019s normal hormone levels, except for prolactin, suggest that it is a prolactinoma causing her symptoms."

The patient\u2019s symptoms of occasional milk discharge from both breasts suggest a prolactinoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland that overproduces the hormone prolactin, which causes lactation.
