The symptoms and laboratory tests are consistent with polycythemia vera, a condition characterized by the excessive proliferation of red blood cells, which can cause pruritis (severe itching), joint pain, and deep vein thrombosis. The best next step in treatment is hydroxyurea, which is used to reduce red blood cell production and decrease the risk of thrombosis. Diphenhydramine may provide symptomatic relief of pruritis but does not address the underlying condition. Febuxostat is used for the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia, which are not present in this patient. Prednisone is a steroid medication that can treat inflammation, but it is not the first-line therapy for polycythemia vera."
