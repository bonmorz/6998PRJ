The patient's elevated tTG levels suggest a possible diagnosis of celiac disease, which is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten consumption. The rash may be a result of dermatitis herpetiformis, which is a skin manifestation of celiac disease. While chlamydia infection may cause genital or rectal symptoms, it is unlikely to be the cause of the rash described by the patient. Streptococcal meningitis infection would present with more severe symptoms such as fever, headache, and neck stiffness, and bed bug infestation would typically result in characteristic bites rather than a rash along the back and flank."
