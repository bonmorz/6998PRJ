The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux and smoking, which are risk factors for esophageal smooth muscle fibrosis. The skin changes and dilated blood vessels on the face suggest that the patient may have scleroderma, which is also associated with esophageal involvement, including fibrosis. Esophageal smooth muscle fibrosis can cause difficulty swallowing. Degeneration of neurons, outpouching of the lower pharyngeal mucosa, and demyelination of brain and spinal cord axons are not associated with the presented symptoms."
