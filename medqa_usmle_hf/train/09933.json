Among the options given, 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. 17-\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency would result in hypertension and hypokalemia, while 5-\u03b1-reductase deficiency would result in undervirilization and an inability to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. Aromatase deficiency would result in virilization and elevated testosterone levels."
