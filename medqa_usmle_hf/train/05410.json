Since both parents are healthy, they are likely carriers of the disease allele. Therefore, the probability that each parent is a carrier is 50%. If both parents are carriers, the probability of their offspring inheriting two copies of the disease allele is 25% and the probability of inheriting one copy is 50%. Therefore, the best answer is (B) 50%. However, it should be noted that more information is needed about the brother's disease status/symptomatology to determine a more accurate prediction of his carrier status."
