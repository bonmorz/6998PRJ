The missing anus may be attributed to the failure of the hindgut to properly develop from the endoderm."

The presence of missing phalanges, single kidney, and heart defect suggests that the mesoderm layer was affected during embryologic development. The missing anus suggests that the endoderm layer might also be affected, but mesoderm is the best answer since it's associated with limb development and kidney and heart formation. The difficulty feeding and apnea suggest neuromuscular involvement, which could be related to neural crest cells, but this is not the most likely tissue affected given the other findings."
