The patient\u2019s symptoms and laboratory results suggest multiple myeloma, which is a cancer of plasma cells in the bone marrow. The lytic lesions in 2 ribs indicate bone involvement. Protein electrophoresis of the serum with immunofixation shows an M-protein spike, which is a hallmark of multiple myeloma. Urinary tract infection is not associated with any of the patient\u2019s symptoms or laboratory results. Leukemic hiatus is a term for a period of cessation or reduction in the progression of leukemia, which is not relevant to this case. Splenomegaly and Richter\u2019s transformation are both associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which is not suggested by any of the patient\u2019s findings."

Richter's transformation is a transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia into a more aggressive form and is not applicable to this patient's symptoms."
