The patient\u2019s symptoms (tall stature, small/firm testes, gynecomastia) suggest Klinefelter syndrome, which is caused by meiotic nondisjunction resulting in an extra X chromosome (XXY). The elevated FSH and LH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure, a common feature of Klinefelter syndrome. Anabolic steroid use and failure of neuronal migration are not typically associated with these symptoms, while CGG trinucleotide repeat disorders are associated with genetic conditions such as fragile X syndrome, which has a different set of symptoms."
