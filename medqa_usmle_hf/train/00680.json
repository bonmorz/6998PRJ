The symptoms of progressive fatigue and shortness of breath while playing sports, along with no other symptoms, suggest a mild form of congenital heart disease. Coarctation of the aorta presents with hypertension in the upper extremities and weak pulses in the lower extremities. Complete atrioventricular septal defect presents with poor weight gain and feeding intolerance. Double-outlet right ventricle with subaortic ventricular septal defect presents with cyanosis and poor feeding in infants. Atrial septal defect is a common congenital heart disease that may present with the clinical features listed above."

The presence of normal blood pressure, normal pulse rate, and no radio-femoral delay suggests that there may not be a coarctation of the aorta. Complete atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) is usually diagnosed in infancy and may cause symptoms earlier than 7 years of age. Double-outlet right ventricle with subaortic ventricular septal defect is an uncommon congenital heart disease. However, the progressive fatigue and shortness of breath while playing sports suggest that the boy has an abnormal communication between the atria, which may lead to volume overload of the right-sided chambers and pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is atrial septal defect (ASD)."
