The barium esophagram shows an esophageal stricture, which can be caused by a variety of conditions including cancer, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and eosinophilic esophagitis. Gastroesophageal endoscopy is the next best step in management as it can help detect any underlying conditions causing the stricture. Myotomy with fundoplication is a surgical procedure that may be done in certain cases, but it is not the first step in management. Giemsa stain of blood smear is used to detect infections such as malaria and is not relevant in this case. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen may be done if other tests are inconclusive, but again, it is not the first step in management."
