Sodium bicarbonate is used as a treatment for cardiotoxicity from tricyclic antidepressants. It can also help reduce the acidic environment caused by the overdose. Glucagon and cyproheptadine have been used in some cases of serotonin syndrome, but it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. Lorazepam is not indicated for treatment of an overdose of clomipramine."

The patient has palpitations, dizziness, dry skin, dilated pupils, and a tachycardic ECG with QRS wide. These signs suggest a tricyclic antidepressant overdose. The treatment is intravenous fluids and sodium bicarbonate to increase the urine pH, making the drug less toxic. Glucagon is used to treat beta-blocker overdose, and cyproheptadine can be used in serotonin syndrome. Lorazepam is not indicated in this case."
