Herd immunity refers to the concept that when a large proportion of a population is immune to a particular disease, even those who are not immunized are still protected.

Genetic drift is a phenomenon related to changes in genetic makeup over time. Tolerance refers to the immune system not attacking one\u2019s own cells. Immune evasion is a strategy used by pathogens to avoid being detected or destroyed by the host immune system.
