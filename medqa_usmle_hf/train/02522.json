The patient's heavy smoking history puts her at an increased risk for developing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, which already have an increased risk with the use of combined OCPs. Therefore, it is recommended to discontinue OCP use and choose an alternative form of contraception. Options A and B are incorrect as they both refer to the effect of smoking on the liver enzyme CYP1A2, which may affect the metabolism of OCPs but not their effectiveness or side effects. Option C is incorrect as smoking has minimal effect on CYP3A4 metabolism of progestin in OCPs."

The patient's symptoms suggest a respiratory infection and there is no indication that smoking inhibits or induces CYP1A2 or CYP3A4. However, smoking is a well-known risk factor for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, especially in women taking OCPs. The physician suggests discontinuing OCPs and using an alternative contraception method to reduce the risk of these potentially life-threatening side effects."

Option (A) and (B) are incorrect as they provide opposite explanations regarding the effect of smoking on CYP1A2.
