The patient's serum \u03b2-hCG concentration is elevated and the ultrasound shows bilateral enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled, septated cysts with clear content, which suggests theca lutein cysts. These cysts can be seen in patients with gestational trophoblastic disease, such as a molar pregnancy, which is confirmed by the dilation and curettage results. Corpus luteum cysts and follicular cysts are common and usually resolve without intervention, while dermoid cysts contain tissue from multiple germ layers and are not associated with this clinical presentation."
