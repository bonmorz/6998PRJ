Elevated serum amylase levels are a common finding in acute pancreatitis, but do not indicate the underlying cause. Increased \u03b2-glucuronidase activity is associated with gallstone pancreatitis, which is not indicated in this case. Impaired cellular copper transport is a characteristic of Wilson's disease, which does not present with acute pancreatitis. Premature activation of trypsinogen within the pancreas is a common cause of acute pancreatitis."
