The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and dry cough, exacerbated by physical activity and relieved by rest, suggest a respiratory problem. The dullness on percussion, decreased vocal tactile fremitus, and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base point towards a pleural effusion. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax and pulmonary tuberculosis would have different symptoms and physical exam findings. Acute bronchitis may cause a cough with sputum production but not shortness of breath, and would not cause the specific physical exam findings mentioned."
