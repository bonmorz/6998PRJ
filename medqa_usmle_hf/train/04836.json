Aromatase deficiency can cause these symptoms and results in a lack of estrogen synthesis, leading to delayed puberty and menstrual cycles. Kallmann syndrome is related to hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency and would not cause androgen excess. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia would have presented earlier in life and Mullerian agenesis would not have present with androgen excess."

Among the options, only Aromatase deficiency can cause both of these symptoms. It is a rare condition in which there is a deficiency of the enzyme aromatase, which converts androgens to estrogens, leading to excess androgens and insufficient estrogen production. This can cause ambiguous genitalia in females and delay in puberty."

The presence of ambiguous genitalia at birth, abnormal hair growth on the chin during pregnancy, and clitoromegaly on pelvic examination suggest a disorder of androgen excess. The nodulocystic acne and multiple ovarian cysts point towards polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but breast development at Tanner stage I suggests that there is a problem with estrogen production. Aromatase deficiency is the most likely diagnosis, as the enzyme is required to convert androgens to estrogens. Kallmann syndrome is associated with delayed onset of puberty, Congenital adrenal hyperplasia with varying degrees of virilization, and Mullerian agenesis with absence of a uterus."
