As a language model AI, it doesn't have the capability to watch videos or use other external information. In general, valproic acid is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug that is effective for a variety of seizure types, including ones that can cause confusion and cognitive impairment. Phenytoin is commonly used for focal seizures and status epilepticus. Ethosuximide is used primarily for absence seizures. Lorazepam may be used for acute seizure management or status epilepticus. The symptoms described in the question suggest that valproic acid may be most appropriate, but the final decision on medication choice should be made by a physician after a full evaluation of the patient's medical history and presentation."
