Increased anion gap and increased serum ketones are expected in diabetic ketoacidosis. Decreased respiratory rate, however, is not a typical symptom of diabetic ketoacidosis, as the body typically tries to compensate for the acidosis by increasing respiratory rate to blow off excess CO2. Increased serum potassium levels may also be observed due to the movement of potassium out of cells in exchange for hydrogen ions."
