The tibial tuberosity is tender to palpation, and the radiograph shows bone fragment avulsions at the site which is consistent with Osgood-Schlatter disease. Patellofemoral pain syndrome usually causes pain in the front of the knee, while pes anserine bursitis usually causes pain on the inside of the knee. Tibial plateau fracture can cause severe knee pain and swelling, but it is unlikely due to the lack of significant trauma."

The radiograph shows a prominent tibial tuberosity and irregularity of the apophysis, which is consistent with Osgood-Schlatter disease, a common cause of knee pain in adolescents involved in sports. The patient's history of recent participation in field hockey and a fall on her knee support this diagnosis. Patellofemoral pain syndrome typically presents with anterior knee pain and is not associated with tibial tuberosity tenderness. Pes anserine bursitis may cause medial knee pain, but it is less likely to be associated with a prominent tibial tuberosity. Tibial plateau fracture usually results from higher-energy trauma and would be less likely to present with a history of overuse and tibial tuberosity tenderness."
