The symptoms and the organism characteristics suggest that the patient has a bacterial infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus pyogenes is susceptible to bacitracin but resists antibodies, has a hyaluronic acid capsule, and forms large mucoid colonies. Solubility in bile, positive coagulase test, and resistance to optochin are characteristics of other bacteria (Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively) that are not the causal organism in this case."
