The patient presents with symptoms consistent with oral thrush, which can be treated with antifungal medication such as fluconazole. The symptoms of nausea, palpitations, and anxiety, along with a tremor in both hands, suggest potential side effects of theophylline, which is commonly used to treat COPD. Therefore, it is likely that the patient was prescribed fluconazole and is experiencing side effects from theophylline."

The patient has white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa that can be scraped off easily, indicating oral thrush. The appropriate pharmacotherapy for this condition is fluconazole, which is an antifungal agent. The symptoms of nausea, palpitations, and anxiety with a pulse of 110/min and a tremor suggest that the patient may be experiencing side effects of the medication. However, the other options (Amphotericin B, Terbinafine, Griseofulvin) are not typically used to treat oral thrush."
