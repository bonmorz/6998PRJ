The presentation of left-sided scrotal pain with nausea and vomiting, pain during urination, and a tender, swollen left testicle with an erythematous left hemiscrotum suggests acute epididymitis or orchitis. Scrotal ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is not necessary unless there are other signs or symptoms suggestive of metastatic disease. Surgical exploration may be necessary in rare cases of testicular torsion or abscess. Measurement of serum mumps IgG titer is not necessary in this case as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a mumps infection."
