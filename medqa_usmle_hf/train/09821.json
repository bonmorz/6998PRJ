The patient has a history of previous pulmonary tuberculosis and is currently presenting with a productive cough with occasional streaks of blood, as well as pulmonary crackles on examination. The x-ray shows a mass in the right upper lung. All of these suggest a possible diagnosis of lung cancer. Repositioning the patient may cause the mass to move, which is a characteristic of a lung tumor. Clusters of gram-positive cocci in sputum may suggest a bacterial infection, but this is not likely in a patient with a previous history of tuberculosis. Multiple lytic foci on skeletal scintigraphy may suggest metastases, but this is not mentioned in the case. A positive c-ANCA test may suggest Wegener's granulomatosis, but this is not likely in this patient."
