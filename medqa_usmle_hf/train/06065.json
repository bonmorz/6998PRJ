Plasmapheresis is the most appropriate next step in management for myasthenic crisis because it rapidly removes circulating antibodies that are causing the crisis. Atropine and edrophonium are used for cholinergic crisis, which can present with similar symptoms but is caused by overmedication with cholinesterase inhibitors. Thymectomy may be indicated for long-term management of myasthenia gravis, but it is not an immediate management option for a myasthenic crisis."
