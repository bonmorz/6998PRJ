AVP increases water reabsorption in the kidneys by upregulating the expression of aquaporin-2 channels in the renal collecting ducts."

The supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei are involved in the production of vasopressin and oxytocin, which are transported by carrier proteins to the kidney where they upregulate the expression of aquaporin-2 channels in the distal tubules, leading to water retention and regulation of urine volume. This is important for maintaining water balance and preventing dehydration. Therefore, the hormone transported by these carrier proteins is likely vasopressin or oxytocin, which have this function. None of the other options are related to these hormones or their functions."

The question describes the carrier protein synthesizing together with a specific hormone and transporting it to its destination, indicating the involvement of a neurohormone. Aquaporin-2 channels are involved in water reabsorption in the kidney, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is responsible for their upregulation, so the answer is (C). Maturation of primordial germ cells is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), not ADH. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is stimulated by growth hormone, not ADH. Stimulation of thyroglobulin cleavage is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), not ADH."
