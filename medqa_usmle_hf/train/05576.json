The most likely cause is a cortisol-secreting adrenal tumor. Options B and D can be ruled out because they both have reduced plasma ACTH. Option A does not fit since elevated serum cortisol is inconsistent with normal plasma ACTH. Therefore, the correct answer is C."

Elevated serum cortisol and 24-h urinary free cortisol are expected in this syndrome, as well as impaired glucose tolerance. However, a low plasma ACTH level is indicative of an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma, which is the likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms. Thus, option (C) is the most likely laboratory profile."

Option A is incorrect because elevated serum cortisol is expected in Cushing's syndrome. Option B is incorrect because high plasma ACTH is expected in pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome, but this patient has an adrenal mass. Option D is incorrect because reduced serum cortisol is not expected in Cushing's syndrome. Therefore, option C is the correct answer, with impaired glucose tolerance, elevated serum cortisol, elevated 24-h urinary free cortisol, and low plasma ACTH being the expected laboratory profile in this patient with adrenal Cushing's syndrome."

The elevated cortisol levels are most likely from the adrenal mass, and the elevated ACTH levels are due to negative feedback from the high cortisol. The impaired glucose tolerance is due to the insulin resistance caused by excess cortisol."
