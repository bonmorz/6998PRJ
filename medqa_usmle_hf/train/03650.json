The patient\u2019s medical history of diabetes and hypertension are not relevant to the answer, so we can eliminate options that relate to those conditions. Option (B) is also incorrect because amyloid A protein usually causes systemic amyloidosis which affects multiple organs, not just joints. Option (A) is related to multiple myeloma or Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, but there is nothing in the patient\u2019s history or presentation to suggest these diagnoses. Option (C) is not relevant to the patient\u2019s presentation."
