The loop of Henle is primarily responsible for the urine concentration and volume through its ability to create a concentration gradient in the medulla of the kidney. In cases of diarrhea, there is decreased fluid absorption in the colon, causing an increased flow of fluid and electrolytes to the loop of Henle, ultimately leading to decreased urine volume and increased urine concentration."
