Open testicular biopsy is not recommended as it may risk spreading the cancer to the scrotum."

The presence of a single enlarged lymph node suggests that the tumor may have spread beyond the testicle, making systemic treatment necessary. An inguinal orchiectomy, which removes the affected testicle and associated structures, is the initial approach to treating testicular cancer. Scrotal orchiectomy (option B) is not appropriate because it doesn't remove lymph nodes that may require chemotherapy. Systemic polychemotherapy (option A) may be necessary following surgery, but lymph node dissection is typically performed first. Open testicular biopsy (option D) would not be the initial procedure, as it only removes a small portion of the affected tissue for diagnostic purposes."
