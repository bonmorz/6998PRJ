The patient presents with symptoms of muscle weakness, paresthesias, and palpitations which could be caused by low potassium levels (hypokalemia). The low serum renin activity and high blood pressure suggest primary hyperaldosteronism, also known as Conn's syndrome, which is caused by an aldosteronoma, a type of adrenal tumor that causes excess production of aldosterone resulting in low potassium levels and high blood pressure. Renal artery stenosis would result in high renin levels, while Cushing syndrome and pheochromocytoma do not typically present with low potassium levels."
