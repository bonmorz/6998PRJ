The symptoms and imaging findings suggest meningitis, and among the options, only viral infections commonly cause meningitis.

Exposure to D2-antagonists may cause drug-induced Parkinson's disease, but does not typically cause meningitis either. Acid-fast resistant bacilli infection may cause tuberculosis meningitis, but there is no mention of other symptoms, such as cough, weight loss or night sweats, that are commonly associated with tuberculosis infection."
