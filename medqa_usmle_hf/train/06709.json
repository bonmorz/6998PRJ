The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with acromegaly, which is caused by excessive growth hormone (GH) secretion. GH stimulates the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is responsible for the clinical manifestations seen in acromegaly. Increased serum metanephrines suggest pheochromocytoma, increased serum cortisol suggests Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and increased serum testosterone suggests androgen excess."

The most useful diagnostic test for acromegaly is the measurement of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which is increased in 95% of cases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Increased serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including progressive acromegaly, hyperhidrosis, and hypertension, suggest an excess of growth hormone caused by a pituitary adenoma. Increased serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) often accompanies pituitary adenomas, and it is responsible for the acromegalic features, such as enlarged pores, hypertrichosis, widely spaced teeth, and prognathism. Increased serum metanephrines indicate a pheochromocytoma, and increased serum cortisol indicates Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Increased serum testosterone would not explain the patient\u2019s symptoms."
