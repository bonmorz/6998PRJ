This inhibition results in increased levels of ACTH, leading to increased production of other hormones such as aldosterone, androgen, and progesterone. Epinephrine is also produced by the adrenal gland, and its synthesis may be affected by inhibition of cortisol production. Therefore, serum concentration of epinephrine is most likely to be decreased after administration of metyrapone."

Normetanephrine and dopamine are produced by the adrenal medulla, while epinephrine is produced by both the adrenal medulla and nerve endings. The inhibition of adrenal 11\u03b2-hydroxylase is not likely to affect normetanephrine or dopamine synthesis, but it may decrease epinephrine synthesis as epinephrine is synthesized from norepinephrine, which requires cortisol as a cofactor. Therefore, the serum concentration of epinephrine is most likely to be decreased after administration of metyrapone."

Epinephrine, also produced by the adrenal medulla, is synthesized from norepinephrine, which is converted by the enzyme PNMT.
