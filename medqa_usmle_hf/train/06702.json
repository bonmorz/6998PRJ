There is a 50% chance that the child will inherit one copy of the mutated FGFR3 gene and have heterozygous achondroplasia, which is the classic form of the condition. Finally, there is a 25% chance that the child will inherit two normal copies of the FGFR3 gene and be of average height. Therefore, the percent of pregnancies between two individuals with achondroplasia that result in a live birth expected to be offspring that are unaffected by this condition is 25% + 25%, or 50%. To determine the chance that a specific pregnancy will result in an unaffected child, we use the Punnett square method."
