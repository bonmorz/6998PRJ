Among the options, only \u03b1-fetoprotein is a tumor marker and can be elevated in NF1 due to the presence of optic glioma. Serum calcium would be expected to be within the normal range."

The history of frequent falls and delayed development suggest a possible underlying genetic disorder, which raises suspicion for an elevated \u03b1-fetoprotein level. The fractured femoral neck and red eyes with dilated, tortuous conjunctival blood vessels suggest abuse or trauma, and lymphocytes and blood glucose levels are not likely to be affected. The cough may indicate a respiratory infection but is not relevant to the laboratory results. The previous calcium and iron supplementations may be related to the delayed development but are not related to the current presentation."
