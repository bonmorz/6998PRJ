The patient is experiencing flushing, which is a common side effect of niacin, which is often used to treat hyperlipidemia. Niacin works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1, leading to decreased prostaglandin synthesis and resulting in flushing. Option (C), irreversible inactivation of cyclooxygenase, would alleviate this symptom. Option (A) refers to the mechanism of action of insulin, which is used to treat diabetes but is not directly relevant to the patient\u2019s current symptom. Option (B) refers to the mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors, which are used to treat hypertension but are not directly relevant to the patient\u2019s current symptom. Option (D) refers to the mechanism of action of statins, which are used to treat hyperlipidemia, but would not alleviate the patient\u2019s current symptom."
