The symptoms and prostate-specific antigen level suggest benign prostatic hyperplasia, which can be treated with a drug that decreases conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, such as finasteride or dutasteride. These drugs also have a side effect of promoting hair growth in male pattern baldness. Option B is incorrect because hydroxyprogesterone is not involved in androgen production. Option C is incorrect because selective alpha-1A/D receptor antagonists, such as tamsulosin, are used to treat urinary symptoms of BPH but do not promote hair growth. Option D is incorrect because it involves a different pathway and is not used to treat BPH."
