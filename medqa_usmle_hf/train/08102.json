The fracture of the greater wing of the left sphenoid bone with compression of the left superior orbital fissure suggests damage to the ophthalmic nerve, which controls the corneal reflex. Therefore, the correct answer is (D). Decreased sense of smell and numbness of the left cheek are unlikely as they are controlled by different nerves. Preserved left lateral gaze is also unlikely as damage to the superior orbital fissure can lead to impairment of eye movement."
