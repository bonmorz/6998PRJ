The laboratory studies show an elevated prothrombin time and a low platelet count, which suggests clotting abnormalities. The most likely mechanism of this patient's symptoms is the presence of thromboplastin in maternal circulation, a condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can be caused by complications of pregnancy or delivery. Separation of the placenta from the uterus or the presence of amniotic fluid in maternal circulation may also result in bleeding, but in this case, the laboratory studies suggest DIC as the underlying mechanism. Decreased synthesis of coagulation factors may also result in bleeding, but it does not explain the elevated prothrombin time and low platelet count seen in this patient."

Among the options, only thromboplastin in maternal circulation can cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is consistent with the patient's symptoms of vaginal bleeding and abnormal coagulation studies. Separation of the placenta from the uterus would lead to placental abruption, which can also cause bleeding but would not explain the abnormal coagulation studies. Amniotic fluid in maternal circulation can cause amniotic fluid embolism, which presents with respiratory distress and hypotension rather than vaginal bleeding."

The most likely underlying mechanism of DIC is the release of thromboplastin in maternal circulation, which triggers the coagulation cascade and leads to clotting and consumption of clotting factors, ultimately leading to bleeding. Separation of the placenta would cause abruptio placentae, leading to pain and abnormal fetal heart rate, but it would not explain the laboratory findings. Amniotic fluid embolism would cause acute respiratory distress and hypotension, but it would not explain the laboratory findings."

The patient's laboratory studies show an elevated prothrombin time and decreased platelet count, suggesting a coagulation disorder. Thromboplastin is a procoagulant substance that can appear in maternal circulation during pregnancy and delivery, causing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The active vaginal bleeding and laboratory findings suggest DIC, which is most likely caused by thromboplastin in maternal circulation. Separation of the placenta from the uterus (placenta abruption) and amniotic fluid embolism can also cause DIC in pregnant women, but there are no other indications of these conditions in the case presentation."
