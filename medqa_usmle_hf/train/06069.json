This would explain the quadriparesis, urinary and bowel incontinence, spasticity, and absence of sensation below the neck. The absence of sensation to pinprick and temperature but normal sensation to vibration, position, and light touch is consistent with a loss of lateral spinothalamic tract fibers, which are more superficial than the dorsal column fibers. The 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum suggests pressure ulcer due to poor nutrition and immobility."
