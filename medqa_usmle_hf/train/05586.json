However, if there is a lack of improvement or worsening of symptoms, treatment with tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 inhibitor, may be considered. Therefore, the beneficial effect of the new drug is likely due to its inhibition of interleukin-6. Thromboxane A2 and leukotriene D4 are involved in inflammation, but they are not the primary target for treating temporal arteritis. Interleukin-4 is involved in allergic responses and has no role in this condition."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest giant cell arteritis (GCA), which is characterized by inflammation of blood vessels. Methylprednisolone is a common treatment for GCA, but it has not improved the patient\u2019s symptoms, indicating a need for a different drug. Interleukin-6 is a cytokine that plays a role in inflammation and is involved in the pathogenesis of GCA. Inhibiting interleukin-6 can help reduce inflammation and improve symptoms. Thus, the new drug most likely inhibits interleukin-6."

The patient's symptoms and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest Giant cell arteritis which involves inflammation of blood vessels. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including Giant cell arteritis, and is often targeted in treatment. The improvement of visual acuity suggests that the drug is effectively reducing inflammation. Thromboxane A2 and Leukotriene D4 are involved in vascular constriction and inflammation, but are not the primary targets in treating Giant cell arteritis. Interleukin-4 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine, and its inhibition could potentially worsen the patient's symptoms."
