The presentation of abdominal pain in the periumbilical area radiating to the right lower quadrant and passing stools with blood suggests a gastrointestinal abnormality. The ultrasound not showing an appendiceal abnormality indicates that the pain was not caused by appendicitis. The histologic evaluation reveals a Meckel's diverticulum, which is a congenital abnormality present at birth, caused by failure of the omphalomesenteric duct to close properly. Increased intraluminal pressure and embryonic peritoneal adhesions are not known causes of a Meckel's diverticulum."

A and B are not supported by the information provided, and C is unlikely because bile ducts do not have gastric mucosa."
