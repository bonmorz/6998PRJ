The most appropriate next step is to administer an anticholinergic medication, such as benztropine, which can help treat dystonia caused by neuroleptics. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be used to treat muscle spasms or anxiety, but it is not the first-line treatment for dystonia. Botulinum toxin is used for chronic dystonia and bromocriptine is used for Parkinson\u2019s disease."
