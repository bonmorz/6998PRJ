The patient\u2019s symptoms and physical examination findings suggest Cushing\u2019s syndrome, which is caused by excess cortisol production. High-dose dexamethasone suppression test shows suppression of ACTH, indicating endogenous production of cortisol. Bilateral hyperplasia of the zona fasciculata is the most common cause of Cushing's syndrome. Benign adenoma of the adrenal medulla causes pheochromocytoma, which is characterized by hypertension and elevated levels of catecholamines. Nodular hypertrophy of the zona reticularis is associated with androgen excess. Unilateral carcinoma of the adrenal cortex can cause hypercortisolism, but it is much less common than bilateral hyperplasia."
