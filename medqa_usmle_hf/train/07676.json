The sudden onset of sub-sternal chest pain and shortness of breath in an elderly male with a history of hypertension and smoking suggests a myocardial infarction. The subsequent development of tachycardia and loss of consciousness indicates arrhythmia. In this case, the microscopic evaluation of the myocardium is most likely to show hyperemic granulation tissue with an abundance of macrophages, which is a common finding in the acute stage of myocardial infarction. This is because macrophages are involved in phagocytosis of necrotic myocardial cells and tissue debris. Coagulative necrosis with dense neutrophilic infiltrate is seen in bacterial myocarditis, while wavy myocardial fibers without inflammatory cells might suggest arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Dense granulation tissue with collagenous scar formation is seen in the healing stages of myocardial infarction."
