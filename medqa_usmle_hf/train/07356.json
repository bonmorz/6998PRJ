Vitamin D can be synthesized from 7-dehydrocholesterol. Therefore, the correct answer is (A). Alpha-tocopherol is a form of vitamin E and does not play a role in vitamin D synthesis. Calcium-sensing receptor regulates calcium homeostasis and not vitamin D synthesis. Glutamyl carboxylase is involved in the post-translational modification of various proteins, including those involved in blood clotting."
