The presentation and location of the ulcer suggest that the most likely cause is Helicobacter pylori infection, which is characterized by curved, flagellated gram-negative rods. Gram-positive lancet-shaped diplococci are seen in Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, but this is not a likely cause of these symptoms. Irregularly drumstick-shaped gram-positive rods are seen in Bacillus anthracis infection, and dimorphic budding yeasts with pseudohyphae are seen in Candida albicans infection, but neither of these is likely to cause a duodenal ulcer with bleeding."
