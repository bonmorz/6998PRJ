The false negative would be the number of patients with breast cancer who tested negative, which we don't know but is not provided in the question. So the denominator would be the sum of true positive and false negative, which we don't know. However, we do know that half of the enrolled patients have breast cancer, so the total number of patients with breast cancer would be 400. Thus, the false negative would be 400 - 330 = 70. Plugging in the numbers, we get 330 / (330 + 70) = 0.824 or 82.4%, which is the sensitivity of the test. Answer choice (C) is correct."
