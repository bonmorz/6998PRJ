The high eosinophil count, red blood cell casts, and elevated serum creatinine also support this diagnosis."

The patient has symptoms consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome), including asthma, chronic sinusitis, peripheral neuropathy (foot drop), and subcutaneous nodules. The elevated eosinophil count and red blood cell casts are also characteristic of EGPA. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis usually do not present with prominent eosinophilia. Polyarteritis nodosa does not typically involve the lungs or cause asthma."
