The swelling of the face and rash on the trunk and extremities suggest the release of a vasoactive amine, which is most likely histamine. Histamine can cause vasodilation and increased vascular permeability leading to the characteristic rash and swelling seen in this patient. Deficiency of C1 inhibitor would cause hereditary angioedema but is not suggested by her history. Activation of complement cascade and deposition of immune complexes are possible causes of some forms of vasculitis but not likely in this patient's case."
