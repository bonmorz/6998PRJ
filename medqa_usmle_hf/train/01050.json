The wobble phenomenon is the ability of the base at the 5' end of the anticodon in tRNA to form non-standard base pairs with more than one type of base at the 3' end of a codon in mRNA. This flexibility in pairing allows for multiple codons to code for the same amino acid. In the case of leucine, the codons can be UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA or CUG. Therefore, option (D) CUA can be another codon coding for leucine."
