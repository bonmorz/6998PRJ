Aplastic anemia is characterized by a decrease in all three cell lines (RBC, WBC, and platelets) and can present with bleeding, fatigue, and infections. Option A describes multiple myeloma, which may cause anemia but is characterized by abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow. Option C describes myelodysplastic syndrome, which may cause anemia and thrombocytopenia but is characterized by dysplastic cells in the bone marrow. Option D describes myelofibrosis, which may cause anemia and thrombocytopenia but is characterized by fibrosis and collagen deposition in the bone marrow."

The symptoms suggest that the boy may have idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which is a condition that causes a decrease in platelet count leading to bleeding and bruising. The bone marrow biopsy in ITP typically shows a hypocellular marrow with megakaryocytes that are either decreased in number or have abnormal morphology. Therefore, the most likely finding in this case would be a hypocellular fat-filled marrow with RBCs of normal morphology (option B)."
