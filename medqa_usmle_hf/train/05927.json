The liver biopsy findings suggest active inflammation with hepatocyte necrosis. Treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents is recommended, such as the combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir. Interferon and ribavirin therapy are no longer first-line treatments due to their side effect profile and lower success rates. Tenofovir and entecavir are used for hepatitis B, not hepatitis C. Tenofovir and velpatasvir are another option for treating HCV, but the combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir is preferred for this specific genotype."

The patient\u2019s history of a car accident and his father\u2019s history of alcoholism suggest a higher risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the positive HCV RNA and HCV genotype 1 indicate that he has chronic HCV infection. The liver biopsy result indicates chronic hepatitis with periportal hepatocyte necrosis, which is consistent with chronic HCV infection. Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir therapy is the most appropriate next step in management for HCV genotype 1 infection as it has a high cure rate with low side effects. Interferon and ribavirin therapy is outdated and has severe side effects. Tenofovir and entecavir therapy are used for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Tenofovir and velpatasvir therapy are used for HCV infections, but not for genotype 1 specifically."
