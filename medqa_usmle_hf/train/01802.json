The patient's symptoms, especially the pruritic rash and subcutaneous nodules, suggest Onchocerciasis, which is also known as river blindness. The presence of motile microfilariae on skin snip biopsy is consistent with this diagnosis. Lymphatic filariasis also presents with skin changes and subcutaneous nodules, but without the characteristic rash. Cysticercosis presents with cystic lesions in various organs, while cutaneous larva migrans presents with linear or serpiginous tracks on the skin."

The pruritic rash and the presence of nontender subcutaneous nodules suggest Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness. Lymphatic filariasis is also a possibility, but it typically presents with swelling of the legs, scrotum or breasts in both men and women. Cysticercosis presents with neurologic symptoms caused by cysts in the brain, whereas cutaneous larva migrans presents with an erythematous papular pruritic rash caused by migration of hookworm larvae under the skin. The definitive diagnosis for Onchocerciasis is made by the microscopic examination of skin snip biopsy specimens."

The symptoms and history of the patient suggest onchocerciasis, which is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus and results in subcutaneous nodules, pruritic rash, and difficulty reading due to eye involvement. The skin snip biopsy with motile microfilariae confirms the diagnosis. Lymphatic filariasis also presents with subcutaneous nodules and microfilariae, but typically involves the lower extremities rather than shoulders and buttocks. Cysticercosis and cutaneous larva migrans have different presentations and are not caused by Onchocerca volvulus."

Lymphatic filariasis can also cause microfilariae in skin samples, but it typically presents with lymphedema and elephantiasis.
