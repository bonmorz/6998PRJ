True positives in this case are 90 out of the 100 patients who tested positive with the gold standard test, which means the probability is 90/100 or 0.9 (since we are dealing with proportions). False positives are 20 out of the 100 patients who tested negative with the gold standard test, which means the probability is 20/100 or 0.2. Dividing the true positive probability by the false positive probability gives us a positive likelihood ratio of 0.9/0.2 or 4.5, which corresponds to option (C). A positive likelihood ratio of more than 1 indicates that the test is more likely to be positive in patients with the condition than in patients without the condition, and a value of 4.5 is considered to be moderate evidence for ruling in the diagnosis."

In this case, the true positive rate is 90/100 and the false positive rate is 20/100 (100 individuals who tested negative with the gold standard test minus the 80 individuals who tested negative with the new test). Therefore, the LR+ is 90/20, which is option (C). This indicates that the test is moderately useful for detecting salivary gland tumors."

Sensitivity is the proportion of true positives (TP) among all positive results (TP + false positives, FP). Specificity is the proportion of true negatives (TN) among all negative results (TN + false negatives, FN). From the given data, we have TP = 90, FP = 10, TN = 80, and FN = 20. So, sensitivity = 90/(90+10) = 0.9 and specificity = 80/(80+20) = 0.8. Plugging these values into the formula gives: 0.9/(1-0.8) = 4.5. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 90/20. A positive likelihood ratio of 4.5 suggests that the test is helpful in confirming the presence of salivary gland tumors, as it increases the odds of having the disease by 4.5 times."
