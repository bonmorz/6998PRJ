An EKG indicates the electrical activity of the heart, while an action potential refers to the electrical activity of a single cardiac muscle cell.

The QR segment is the deflection immediately following the QRS complex, and it represents the end of ventricular depolarization and the beginning of repolarization. In Image B, Phase 0 of the action potential is characterized by a rapid influx of sodium, which corresponds to the QRS complex on the EKG.
