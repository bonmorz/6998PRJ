The symptoms and findings suggest that the patient has Parkinson's disease, which is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. However, the question is asking for an additional feature that would be expected to find in this patient. The dilation of the ventricular system is a common finding in Parkinson's disease due to atrophy of brain tissue. Degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta is already mentioned in the question stem, so it is not an additional feature. Accumulation of Lewy bodies in cortical cells is another hallmark feature of Parkinson's disease but is not mentioned in the question stem. Caudate head atrophy is a characteristic finding in Huntington's disease, not Parkinson's disease."

The symptoms of apathy, distraction, and starting to urinate in bed suggest cognitive and motor impairment, which can be caused by various conditions. Broad-based shuffling gait, increased muscle tone, and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes suggest Parkinson's disease. Dilation of the ventricular system is a common finding on imaging in patients with Parkinson's disease. Degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta is a hallmark feature of Parkinson's disease, but it cannot be assumed to be present without imaging. Accumulation of Lewy bodies in cortical cells is a hallmark feature of dementia with Lewy bodies, another condition that can present with Parkinsonism. Caudate head atrophy is a finding in Huntington's disease, which typically presents with choreiform movements rather than Parkinsonism."

Option D, caudate head atrophy, is seen in Huntington's disease, not Parkinson's.
