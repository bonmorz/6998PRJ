Among the options, fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is the most appropriate initial medication because it can reduce obsessive-compulsive tendencies. Clomipramine is another medication that can reduce such tendencies, but it has more side effects than fluoxetine. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is also a recommended treatment for excoriation disorder. Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) is a type of CBT that may be effective for patients with borderline personality disorder or those with self-harming tendencies. Interpersonal psychotherapy focuses on interpersonal relationships and may not be as effective for treating excoriation disorder."
