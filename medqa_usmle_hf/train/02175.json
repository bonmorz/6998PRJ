The right shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve present in Curve A suggests a decreased affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, which can be caused by a higher-than-normal concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG). This can be seen in conditions such as polycythemia, where there is an increased number of erythrocytes resulting in higher levels of 2,3-DPG. Temperature, sickled red blood cells, and serum pH all affect the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, but do not result in the same rightward shift seen in Curve A."
