The symptoms described suggest the patient has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which can cause cardiac and skeletal muscle abnormalities. Anticipation is a phenomenon where the disease worsens as it is passed through generations due to increasing instability of the repeat unit mutations in the dystrophin gene. This means that the younger generation experiences a more severe form of the disease than their older relatives. The other genetic properties do not fit the scenario described."

The symptoms exhibited by both the patient and his father suggest a genetic component, most likely with anticipation, as the patient has more severe symptoms and a younger age of onset. This phenomenon, seen in diseases like myotonic dystrophy, involves a genetic expansion of a trinucleotide repeat with each successive generation leading to earlier onset and more severe symptoms. Pleiotropy refers to one gene affecting multiple phenotypic traits, which is not applicable in this case. Loss of heterozygosity and codominance involve different mechanisms of gene expression and inheritance, but are also not applicable in this case."

Pleiotropy refers to a single gene having multiple effects, loss of heterozygosity occurs when a gene is lost from one of the chromosomes, and codominance refers to both alleles being expressed equally in a heterozygote. None of these options are relevant in this case."
