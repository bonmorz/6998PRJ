The baby's presentation is consistent with hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), which is caused by incompatibility between the mother's and baby's blood types. The positive Coombs test confirms this, indicating antibodies against the baby's red blood cells. Hepatosplenomegaly is a common finding in severe cases of HDN due to the excessive breakdown of red blood cells. Hyposthenuria (inability to concentrate urine) and elevated urinary coproporphyrins are not typically associated with HDN. The eosin-5-maleimide binding test is used to diagnose hereditary spherocytosis, a different type of hemolytic anemia that is not related to HDN."
