The presence of HbsAg and HbeAg indicates an active infection, and the absence of Anti-HbsAg indicates no past infection. The patient has mildly elevated aminotransferases, suggesting liver damage. The presence of Anti-HbeAg indicates a transition from an acute to a chronic infection, as the body starts to produce antibodies against the HBeAg protein of the virus. Option B matches all of these findings, indicating that the patient has developed a chronic form of his viral infection."

This question requires knowledge of the different markers used to diagnose hepatitis B and determine if it is acute or chronic. HbsAg +, Anti-HbcAg IgG +, and HbeAg + are all markers for active viral replication, indicating an acute form of the infection. The presence of HbsAg for more than 6 months is diagnostic of chronic hepatitis B. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer, as it displays markers of chronic hepatitis B."
