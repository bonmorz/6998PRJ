The absence of sperm cells in seminal fluid suggests infertility. These symptoms are consistent with cystic fibrosis, which is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which encodes for a chloride channel protein that opens in response to binding with ATP. Therefore, the impaired function of the CFTR channel protein is due to the inability to respond to ATP binding. The other options are not related to cystic fibrosis or ATP binding."

The patient\u2019s history of recurrent respiratory infections and hepatomegaly suggest a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. The increased ALT and AST levels may indicate liver damage. Clubbing of nail beds is a non-specific finding in many diseases including cystic fibrosis. The lack of sperm cells in the seminal fluid suggests obstruction of the vas deferens, which is common in males with cystic fibrosis. The channel protein impaired in cystic fibrosis is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which opens in response to binding of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
