During inspiration, the pressure within the pleural cavity becomes more negative in reference to atmospheric pressure, causing a decrease in pressure between the parietal and visceral pleura (Probe A) and no change in pressure within the alveoli (Probe B). Therefore, the correct answer is Probe A: -6 mm Hg; Probe B: 0 mm Hg. Option (A) is incorrect because pressure between the parietal and visceral pleura becomes more negative during inspiration. Option (B) is incorrect because the pressure within the alveoli does not increase during inspiration. Option (D) is incorrect because the pressure between the parietal and visceral pleura becomes more negative during inspiration."

Since Probe B is within the cavity of an alveoli, the pressure reading should be negative. This leaves us with Option C and D as potential answers. According to the article, the pressure between the parietal and visceral pleura should become more negative than the alveolar pressure during inspiration. Therefore, the pressure reading from Probe A will be more negative than Probe B. The only option that fits this pattern is Option C, where Probe A reads -6 mm Hg and Probe B reads 0 mm Hg at the end of inspiration."

During normal inspiration, the pressure within the pleural space becomes more negative (i.e. lower) as the diaphragm contracts and expands the thorax. This causes an increase in the transpulmonary pressure gradient and helps to pull air into the lungs. The pressure within the alveoli also decreases slightly during this phase, but not as much as the pressure within the pleural space. Therefore, the most likely set of values at end of inspiration would be Probe A: -6 mm Hg and Probe B: 0 mm Hg, as this would reflect the more negative pressure within the pleural space and the relatively stable pressure within the alveoli."
