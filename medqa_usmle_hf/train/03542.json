The patient presents with painful vaginal bleeding, uterine tenderness, and a firm uterus. These are all indicative of placental abruption, which is the separation of the placenta from the uterine wall before delivery. The risk factors include trauma, smoking, prior abruption, and hypertension. Preterm labor is unlikely as the patient is already at 39 weeks of gestation. Vasa previa is a rare condition in which fetal blood vessels cross the cervix and rupture during labor, causing fetal hemorrhage. Eclampsia is a complication of preeclampsia characterized by seizures and is associated with hypertension and proteinuria, which the patient does not have."
