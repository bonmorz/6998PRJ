The horizontal nystagmus observed during examination further supports the diagnosis. The next best step in management would be reassurance and administration of vestibular suppressants such as meclizine or dimenhydrinate. Antibiotics and high-dose steroids are not indicated in the case of BPPV. MRI of the brain with gadolinium may be considered if there is no improvement in symptoms despite initial management."

The horizontal nystagmus observed during the examination supports this diagnosis. The next best step in management would be reassurance and vestibular suppressants, as the condition often resolves on its own but can be helped with medication to control symptoms. Antibiotics and steroids would not be indicated in this case, and an MRI of the brain with gadolinium would not be necessary without further indications."

The presence of horizontal nystagmus indicates peripheral vestibular dysfunction. MRI with gadolinium is not necessary at this point, as the symptoms are most likely due to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Treatment options for BPPV include reassurance, vestibular suppressants, and maneuvers like the Epley maneuver to reposition the displaced otoconia in the inner ear. Antibiotics and high dose steroids are not indicated unless there is an evidence of concurrent infection or autoimmune condition."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a disorder caused by displacement of small crystals in the inner ear. The next best step would be to offer reassurance and vestibular suppressants, such as meclizine, to relieve her symptoms. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and high dose steroids are not indicated for BPPV. An MRI with gadolinium may be ordered if more serious causes are suspected, such as a cerebrovascular accident or acoustic neuroma, but is not necessary as the patient\u2019s presentation is typical of BPPV."
