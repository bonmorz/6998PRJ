The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest chronic sinusitis and bronchitis, which is commonly seen in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The absence of heart sounds along the left lower chest is a sign of dextrocardia, which is often seen in patients with PCD. Immotile sperm is common in male patients with PCD. Defective interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain is seen in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, and increased sweat chloride levels are seen in cystic fibrosis, which are not likely in this patient. Increased forced expiratory volume suggests healthy lung function, which is not likely in this patient based on the physical exam findings."
