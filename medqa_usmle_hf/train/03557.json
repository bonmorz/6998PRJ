The pathology findings of abnormal melanocytes forming nests at the dermo-epidermal junction and discohesive cell growth into the epidermis are consistent with superficial spreading melanoma, which is the most common type of melanoma. Nodular melanoma typically presents as a new, rapidly growing pigmented nodule, while lentigo melanoma arises from a preexisting lentigo maligna lesion and often has tan-to-black color variation on sun-damaged skin. Desmoplastic melanoma is a rare type of melanoma with a fibrous, desmoplastic stroma."
