Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir and zanamivir work by blocking the activity of the influenza virus neuraminidase enzyme, which prevents the release of new virus particles from infected cells. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer. DNA polymerase inhibitors and reverse transcriptase inhibitors are used to treat viral infections such as HIV, while RNA-dependent polymerase inhibitors are used to treat hepatitis C."
