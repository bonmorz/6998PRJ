The patient\u2019s symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that he is experiencing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC causes consumption of clotting factors and platelets, resulting in prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and decreased fibrinogen levels. Additionally, the presence of schistocytes on peripheral blood smear and elevated D-dimer levels indicate ongoing coagulation and fibrinolysis. Therefore, the most likely set of serum findings in this patient is an elevated PT and PTT, decreased fibrinogen, and elevated D-dimer levels. Option (C) is the correct answer."

The symptoms described suggest that the patient is experiencing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can occur secondary to severe infections like sepsis. In DIC, there is an over-activation of the clotting system, leading to widespread formation of microthrombi, which then consume platelets and clotting factors, leading to bleeding. Therefore, we can expect an increased prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, and decreased fibrinogen levels, as well as an elevated D-dimer level as a result of the breakdown of the clots. Option (C) is the only one that matches these findings."
