The observed results are due to the increased activity of adenylate cyclase in broth A compared to broth C. Adenylate cyclase is responsible for producing cyclic AMP, which activates the lac operon and induces the transcription of enzymes needed for lactose utilization. Since broth A contains only lactose and no glucose, the cells rely solely on lactose utilization and have high levels of cyclic AMP leading to higher lactose utilization. In contrast, cells in broth C have both glucose and lactose, resulting in lower cyclic AMP levels and lower lactose utilization. Broth A and C have the same lactose concentration, so decreased production of \u03b1-galactosidase A (option C) cannot explain the results. Glycosylases (option A) are enzymes that repair DNA damage; they are not involved in lactose metabolism. Catabolite activator protein (option B) is involved in glucose repression, but it cannot explain the results observed here."

The fact that Broth A has higher levels of lactose and galactose and lower levels of glucose compared to Broth C suggests that lactose and galactose are being utilized more efficiently in Broth A. This is likely due to increased activity of adenylate cyclase, which leads to higher levels of cyclic AMP and activation of the lac operon responsible for lactose and galactose utilization. The other options are not supported by the experimental results."

The results show a high amount of lactose and low amounts of galactose and glucose in broth A, which contains only lactose. In contrast, broth C, which contains both lactose and glucose, has high amounts of both sugars. This suggests that the presence of glucose activates adenylate cyclase in E. coli, leading to increased production of cAMP and subsequent activation of the lac operon required for lactose metabolism. Therefore, the most likely property of broth A compared to broth C is an increased activity of adenylate cyclase."

The observation in Broth A compared to Broth C is the higher amount of lactose and galactose and lower amount of glucose. This suggests that in Broth A, there was increased activity of adenylate cyclase, which increases the levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP then binds to the catabolite activator protein (CAP) and increases transcription of the lac operon, leading to increased lactose metabolism. In Broth C, both lactose and glucose are present, and glucose inhibits adenylate cyclase activity, leading to lower levels of cAMP and therefore lower lactose metabolism. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Increased activity of adenylate cyclase."

                "content": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. This question requires a basic understanding of bacterial metabolism. E. coli utilizes glucose before lactose, and catabolite activator protein (CAP) regulates this process. Broth A contains only lactose, so E. coli cannot utilize it until it produces \u03b2-galactosidase to break it down into glucose and galactose. This process requires activation of the lac operon by the presence of lactose and the absence of glucose. The presence of glucose in broth C inhibits adenylate cyclase, which leads to decreased levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP), an activator of the lac operon. Therefore, E. coli in broth C utilizes glucose first, but can also produce enough \u03b2-galactosidase to utilize lactose. The absence of lactose in broth B means that the lac operon is not activated, and E. coli can only utilize glucose. Therefore, the observed results in broth A and C are due to increased activity of adenylate cyclase, which allows for activation of the lac operon and utilization of lactose in the presence of glucose."

In contrast, Broth A lacks glucose and therefore lacks cAMP-CAP signaling, resulting in decreased lactose consumption. There is no evidence to support the other options."

The difference in the amounts of lactose and glucose between Broth A and C suggests that Broth A has increased activity of adenylate cyclase, which leads to increased levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and subsequent activation of catabolite activator protein (CAP). CAP activates transcription of genes involved in lactose uptake and metabolism, leading to increased lactose utilization in Broth A compared to Broth C. The difference in galactose levels may be due to differences in the production of \u03b1-galactosidase A, but there is no evidence to support this option. There is no reason to suspect glycosylases to be involved in this process."

The presence of both lactose and glucose in broth C suggests that E. coli can utilize both sugars through induction of the lac operon by cAMP and CAP. Broth A contains only lactose, leading to the utilization of lactose alone by E. coli. In the absence of another readily available source of glucose, E. coli must activate the cAMP-dependent regulatory pathway to maintain metabolism, leading to increased activity of adenylate cyclase. This results in increased levels of cyclic AMP, which activates catabolic gene expression, including the expression of genes required for lactose metabolism. Therefore, the observed results are most likely due to the increased activity of adenylate cyclase in broth A compared to broth C."
