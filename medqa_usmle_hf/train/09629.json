The patient's symptoms suggest that he is likely suffering from a prolactinoma, which is a type of adenoma that produces excessive amounts of prolactin. This can cause headaches, decreased libido, and vision problems. Lactotrophs are the cells in the anterior pituitary gland that produce prolactin. Corticotrophs produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyrotrophs produce thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and gonadotrophs produce follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). None of these adenomas would cause the symptoms described by the patient."
