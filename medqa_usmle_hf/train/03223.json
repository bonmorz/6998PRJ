The presence of a single dark body attached to the nuclear membrane in the buccal mucosal scraping is consistent with Turner Syndrome, which is caused by a postzygotic mitotic error resulting in loss of the X chromosome. Uniparental isodisomy and Robertsonian translocation involve changes in chromosome structure, while reciprocal translocation involves exchange of genetic material between chromosomes. None of these are related to Turner Syndrome."

Uniparental disomy occurs when both homologous chromosomes are inherited from one parent. Robertsonian translocation and reciprocal translocation involve rearrangement of genetic material between non-homologous chromosomes and can lead to balanced chromosomal rearrangements, not partial deletions."
