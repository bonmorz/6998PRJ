The patient's symptoms and work history suggest occupational lung disease, most likely interstitial lung disease, which can cause decreased diffusion lung capacity of CO. The absence of digital clubbing and normal blood pressure suggest that pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure are not likely to be increased. The ratio of FEV1/FVC is normal in this patient, suggesting that there is no obstruction in the airways."
