Option (A) is incorrect as the patient's decision is his own and it is not necessary for his wife to agree before he undergoes the procedure. Option (B) is inappropriate and ethically questionable as it violates patient confidentiality. Option (D) is not an appropriate response as the patient has the right to make his own decisions.
