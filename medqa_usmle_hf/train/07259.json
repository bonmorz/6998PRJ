The tenderness in the left lower quadrant also supports this diagnosis. Crohn's disease is associated with chronic diarrhea and weight loss. Cholecystitis typically presents with right upper quadrant pain and may be associated with nausea and vomiting, but not diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome usually presents with recurrent abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits, but not necessarily with fever and tenderness on physical exam."

The patient presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and tenderness in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. The 12-month history of intermittent constipation may suggest the presence of diverticula, which are small pouches that can form in the colon. Diverticulitis occurs when these pouches become inflamed or infected, causing symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms, but it is less likely given the acute onset of symptoms in this patient. Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder and can cause right upper quadrant abdominal pain, which is not present in this patient. Irritable bowel syndrome can cause abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits, but it is a diagnosis of exclusion and typically requires a more chronic history of symptoms."

The patient has abdominal pain that is constant and rated at 7/10, along with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which suggests an inflammatory process affecting the colon or lower intestine. The tenderness in the left lower quadrant indicates involvement of the sigmoid colon, consistent with diverticulitis. Crohn disease typically involves the terminal ileum or colon and can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Cholecystitis is usually associated with right upper quadrant pain and fever. Irritable bowel syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion and is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is diverticulitis."
