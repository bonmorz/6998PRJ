The presentation of long, thin face with large jaw, protruding ears, macroorchidism, and a holosystolic murmur is consistent with Fragile X syndrome, which is caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion on the X chromosome. Answer (C) is the correct choice. CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions on chromosome 4 are associated with Huntington disease, GAA trinucleotide repeat expansions on chromosome 9 are associated with Friedreich ataxia, and CTG trinucleotide repeat expansions on chromosome 8 are associated with myotonic dystrophy."

The high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the apex of the heart that radiates to the axilla would be unrelated."
