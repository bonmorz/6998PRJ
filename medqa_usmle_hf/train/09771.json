The patient has a history of recurrent abortions, joint pain, skin rashes, and the symptoms of Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. These suggest systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The most likely test to confirm SLE and APS is testing for anticardiolipin antibodies. Test for cryoglobulins is used to diagnose cryoglobulinemia which is not commonly associated with the patient\u2019s symptoms. Hysteroscopy is not necessary in confirming the diagnosis. Blood smear for sickle cells is used to diagnose sickle cell anemia, which is not common in African Americans with the patient\u2019s symptoms."

The patient's symptoms suggest systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is commonly associated with recurrent abortions, joint pain, migraines, and skin rashes. The presence of two ulcerations on the tip of the right index finger and multiple tiny hemorrhages under the nails suggest antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is a common complication of SLE. A test for anticardiolipin antibodies can confirm the diagnosis of APS. Test for cryoglobulins is used to diagnose cryoglobulinemia, which is not typically associated with the patient's symptoms.
