The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest carcinoid syndrome, which is characterized by diarrhea, flushing, and bronchoconstriction (wheezing).

The best initial step in management is to obtain a urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) level, which is an indicator of serotonin metabolism and is elevated in patients with carcinoid syndrome. Echocardiography, plasma free metanephrine levels, and pulmonary function tests would not be helpful in diagnosing carcinoid syndrome."

The patient's symptoms and history suggest that he may have carcinoid syndrome, which is characterized by diarrhea, flushing, and wheezing.

This can be done through a simple 24-hour urine collection. Echocardiography, plasma free metanephrine levels, and pulmonary function tests may be useful in certain situations, but are not the best initial step in this case."
