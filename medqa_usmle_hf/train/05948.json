The symptoms and history suggest that the patient may have a glycogen disorder, specifically glycogen storage disease type V (McArdle disease), which affects the breakdown of glycogen in muscle cells. Upon examination, normal glycogen structure would be expected because the disease primarily affects glycogen breakdown, not synthesis. Options A and C describe glycogen disorders with abnormal branching, which is not seen in McArdle disease. Option D is not a possible finding as glycogen is always present in muscle cells."

The symptoms, history of muscle cramps, and elevated creatine kinase level suggest a possible hereditary glycogen disorder. However, based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, it is most likely that the patient has exercised-induced rhabdomyolysis, which can cause myoglobinuria and elevated creatine kinase levels. The correct answer, therefore, is that normal glycogen structure would be expected upon examination of his cells. None of the other options are consistent with the diagnosis of a hereditary glycogen disorder or the clinical presentation described in this scenario."

Based on the clinical presentation of muscle cramps and rhabdomyolysis, along with a history of muscle cramps with exercise since childhood, the most likely hereditary glycogen disorder is McArdle disease, which is characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme myophosphorylase. Upon examination of his cells, you would expect to find normal glycogen structure, as opposed to glycogen with abnormal branching patterns or short outer glycogen chains seen in other glycogen storage disorders. Absence of glycogen in muscles would be indicative of a different type of metabolic disorder altogether."

The presentation suggests the possibility of a glycogen storage disease, but the absence of a family history and other specific symptoms rules out some options. Myoglobinuria implies rhabdomyolysis, which can result from excess muscle breakdown due to overexertion or metabolic disorders such as glycogen storage disease. Among the glycogen storage diseases, McArdle disease (GSD type V) is most likely given the patient\u2019s symptoms. The abnormality in this condition is a deficiency in muscle glycogen phosphorylase, leading to impaired glycogen breakdown. Muscle biopsy in patients with McArdle disease typically shows normal glycogen structure."

Since the patient\u2019s presentation involves muscle aches, we can narrow down the possible glycogen storage diseases to Pompe disease, McArdle disease, and Tarui disease. Pompe disease is characterized by the buildup of glycogen with an abnormal branching pattern. McArdle disease is characterized by the absence of muscle phosphorylase, which leads to the accumulation of normal glycogen in muscles. Tarui disease is characterized by short outer glycogen chains. Based on this information, we can determine that the most likely answer is (B) normal glycogen structure, which is consistent with McArdle disease."
