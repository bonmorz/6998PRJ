Ghrelin is an endogenous hormone produced by the stomach that stimulates appetite and food intake by activating orexigenic neurons in the hypothalamus. Administration of a synthetic analog of ghrelin to mice would therefore likely lead to increased food intake and weight gain. Cholecystokinin and somatostatin both have satiety-promoting effects, and glucagon primarily affects glucose metabolism and does not have significant effects on appetite or weight gain."
