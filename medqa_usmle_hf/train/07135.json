The patient presents with symptoms of acute onset lower limb weakness, numbness, and tingling sensations, as well as absent reflexes and decreased sensation in a stocking distribution, which suggests a peripheral neuropathy. The most likely diagnosis is Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). Nerve conduction studies (NCS) would be the most useful test to confirm the diagnosis of GBS because it assesses the conduction of electrical impulses along nerves and can determine if there is demyelination or axonal damage. MRI of the lumbosacral spine may show inflammatory changes in GBS, but is not as useful as NCS in making the diagnosis. Serum creatine kinase and muscle biopsy are not useful in diagnosing GBS."
