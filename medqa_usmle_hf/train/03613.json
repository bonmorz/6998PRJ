Additionally, the patient's history of recurrent sinus infections, chronic cough, and mucus production may also suggest a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, which can be associated with tricuspid stenosis and airway dilation. The bruises along the patient's shins may also raise concerns for possible physical abuse or neglect, which should be investigated further. Hypocalcemia and social withdrawal/avoidance of eye contact are not typically associated with cystic fibrosis or tricuspid stenosis. Repeat sinus infections may be associated with cystic fibrosis, but the fact that this patient has had a chronic history of sinus issues since birth suggests something other than seasonal allergies as the underlying cause."

The patient's history of chronic cough, mucus production, and repeated episodes of sinus pain/pressure suggests a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

The diastolic murmur best heard along the right lower sternal border is also often seen in patients with cystic fibrosis due to pulmonary hypertension. Hypocalcemia is not associated with cystic fibrosis, and while seasonal allergies can contribute to sinus infections, the patient's history is more consistent with a chronic issue. Social withdrawal and avoidance of eye contact may be seen in children with autism, but there is no indication that this patient has autism."

Based on the patient's history of chronic cough and mucus production, tricuspid stenosis, and airway dilation on MRI, the most likely underlying diagnosis is cystic fibrosis.

Repeat sinus infections may be a symptom, but the history of chronic cough and mucus production points more strongly to cystic fibrosis. Social withdrawal and avoidance of eye contact are not specific to cystic fibrosis."
