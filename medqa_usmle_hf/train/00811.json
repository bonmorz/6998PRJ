The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, which can cause anemia due to decreased erythropoietin production. Alcoholism and liver disease can also cause anemia, but they are less likely given the patient's alcohol intake and the negative fecal occult blood test. Colorectal cancer is a possibility but less likely due to the absence of positive fecal occult blood test. The CBC shows a normocytic anemia, which is consistent with anemia of chronic kidney disease."

Alcoholism and liver disease can also cause anemia, but they are less likely to be the cause in this scenario.
