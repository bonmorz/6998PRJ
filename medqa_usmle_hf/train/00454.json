The patient is presenting with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which includes cardiovascular symptoms such as palpitations and chest pain. Among the options, only increased sensitivity of \u00df1-adrenergic receptors can explain these symptoms. This is because hyperthyroidism can lead to an upregulation of \u00df1-adrenergic receptors, which can make the heart more sensitive to the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine, leading to an increased heart rate and palpitations."
