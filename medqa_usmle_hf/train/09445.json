Blood at the urethral meatus and contusion at the base of the scrotum indicate the possibility of a urethral injury. Therefore, the most appropriate initial action would be to obtain a retrograde urethrogram (RUG), including a pre-injection kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) film to assess the integrity of the urethra. Foley catheterization or suprapubic cystostomy should be avoided until the extent of urethral injury is determined. Surgery should be considered if there is a clear indication of urethral injury or bladder rupture."

Inserting a Foley catheter or performing a suprapubic cystostomy without knowing if there is a urethral injury can worsen the injury. Taking the patient emergently to the operating room to check for a urethral injury with IV indigo carmine is not the best initial action because it can be invasive and has a risk of anaphylaxis."
