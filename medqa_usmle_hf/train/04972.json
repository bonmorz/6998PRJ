Basal cell carcinomas are typically locally invasive rather than prone to metastasis, therefore options A and D can be ruled out. Option B is not correct because basal cell carcinoma can become aggressive and invade surrounding tissue."

BCCs are typically slow-growing and have low metastatic potential. The most common mode of spread of BCCs is local invasion via collagenase, which allows the tumor cells to break down the surrounding collagen and invade surrounding tissues. Seeding is an uncommon mode of spread for BCCs. Lymphatic spread is relatively rare, occurring in only about 5% of cases."

The description of the lesion, along with the histopathology findings, suggests that the most likely diagnosis is basal cell carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma commonly spreads locally via collagenase, which breaks down collagen in the extracellular matrix to facilitate invasion of tumor cells into surrounding tissue. It is typically a slow-growing and non-metastasizing tumor, so options (A) and (D) can be ruled out. Option (B) is also not correct as basal cell carcinoma can become invasive and cause local destruction if left untreated."

The patient\u2019s lesion had a pearly appearance with telangiectasia and central ulceration and curled borders, which suggests a possible diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma. The histopathology finding of peripheral palisading cells with large, hyperchromatic nuclei and a high nuclear: cytoplasmic ratio, confirms this diagnosis. Basal cell carcinomas typically invade via collagenase leading to local invasion rather than spreading through lymphatic or hematogenous routes. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Local invasion via collagenase."
