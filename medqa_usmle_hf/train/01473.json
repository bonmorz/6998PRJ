The patient's symptoms suggest biliary colic or cholecystitis, and the elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels suggest a biliary tract obstruction. Transabdominal ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis to visualize the biliary tract and gallbladder to confirm the obstruction and identify the cause. CT scan of the abdomen can be used if ultrasonography is inconclusive or if there are other possible causes of the symptoms. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and HIDA scan of the biliary tract are possible diagnostic and therapeutic options but are not the initial step in diagnosis."

Transabdominal ultrasonography is the standard diagnostic tool for cholecystitis, as it can identify gallstones, thickening of the gallbladder wall, and other signs of inflammation. CT scan may show inflammation but may not detect gallstones. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an invasive procedure that is typically reserved for cases where other diagnostic methods have been inconclusive or when therapeutic interventions such as removal of gallstones or stent placement are needed. HIDA scan is used to evaluate the function of the biliary system but may not be necessary for the initial diagnosis of cholecystitis."
