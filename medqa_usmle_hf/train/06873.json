Infant hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin, which means it holds onto oxygen more tightly. It does not form hexagonal crystals. However, it has a decreased affinity for 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), which means it releases oxygen more readily. This is important because it ensures that oxygen can be delivered to the developing tissues of the baby."

Compared to adult hemoglobin, HbF has decreased affinity for 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Therefore, the correct answer is (C)."
