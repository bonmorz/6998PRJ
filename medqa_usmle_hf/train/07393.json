The patient\u2019s blood pressure has improved with the chlorthalidone but she exhibits side effects like urinary frequency and a fine tremor. A change in diuretics may help manage the side effects better, such as switching to a potassium-sparing diuretic or a loop diuretic. Increasing captopril or chlorthalidone dose may further exacerbate the side effects. Ultrasound of the renal arteries is not warranted at this point."

This is a possible cause of her refractory hypertension. Therefore, the best next step would be to change diuretics to a loop diuretic as they can help with hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis. An ultrasound of the renal arteries may be done later to confirm the diagnosis. Increasing captopril or chlorthalidone dose may not be appropriate since the patient already exhibits signs of excessive diuresis (fine tremor and increased urinary frequency)."
