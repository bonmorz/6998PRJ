Vancomycin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the D-alanyl-D-alanine residues on the peptidoglycan cell wall precursor molecules. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) have the ability to substitute D-lactate to the D-alanine terminus because of a modification in the cell wall peptide sequence. This modification makes the cell wall less susceptible to vancomycin binding, leading to the development of resistance to vancomycin. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."

The question is asking for the mechanism that best explains the increased incidence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus fecalis infections. Among the options, the replacement of the terminal D-ala in the cell wall peptidoglycan by D-lactate is the mechanism that confers resistance to vancomycin. Qnr protein protects the antibiotic-binding site of quinolones, efflux pumps extrude antibiotics from the bacterial cell, and decreased number of porins lead to decreased intracellular entry of the antibiotic have no relation to vancomycin resistance."

One of the mechanisms of resistance is the substitution of a terminal D-ala in the cell wall peptidoglycan by D-lactate, which prevents vancomycin from binding to the cell wall. This mechanism is often called the VanA type of resistance. Protection of the antibiotic-binding site by Qnr protein is a mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance in bacteria. Increased expression of efflux pumps which extrude the antibiotic from the bacterial cell and decreased number of porins in the bacterial cell wall leading to decreased intracellular entry of the antibiotic are mechanisms of resistance to other groups of antibiotics, but not vancomycin."
