His blood pressure readings have consistently been high and his family history includes hypertension. The next step in management should therefore focus on lifestyle modifications including weight loss, exercise, and a salt-restricted diet to help reduce blood pressure. It is important to address lifestyle changes before pharmacotherapy. Ordering a glycosylated hemoglobin test is not necessary as the patient's fasting glucose level is in the normal range. Starting the patient on lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril together may be necessary if lifestyle modifications fail to significantly reduce his blood pressure."

The laboratory tests show no indication of diabetes. Therefore, the best next step in management is lifestyle modification, including weight loss, exercise, and dietary changes. This is the first-line approach for managing mild hypertension in patients without diabetes. Starting medication should be reserved for patients with more significant hypertension or those who do not respond to lifestyle changes. Ordering an HbA1c test is not necessary as the patient has no symptoms or risk factors for diabetes. Starting hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril together is not the best initial approach and can lead to side effects, especially in an overweight patient."
