Selection bias would occur if the volunteers in one group were significantly different from those in the other group, but the mean age and CI were similar.

The researchers who compared the before and after photographs were aware of which formula was used by each group, and this knowledge could have influenced their assessment of the efficacy of the new formula. To minimize observer bias, a blinded evaluator should have compared the photographs without knowledge of the formula used.
