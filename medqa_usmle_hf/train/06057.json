This question is a bit tricky, but based on the fact that the hormone has a similar size to another known hormone, we can narrow down the options. The thyroid gland produces several hormones, including thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which have similar sizes and are both involved in regulating metabolism. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) thyroid gland."

The question provides very specific details about the study, such as the focus on progesterone during pregnancy and the identification of a circulating factor responsible for its behavior. However, the answer options do not provide clear clues. The only option that can be linked to hormone production and action is the thyroid gland. Therefore, the correct answer is (D), and the explanation is based on elimination and deduction rather than direct information provided in the question stem."

Since the question does not mention the specific hormones or circulating factor being studied, it is difficult to determine the exact answer. However, the answer can be inferred by eliminating the options that do not fit the description given. Progesterone is mainly produced by the ovaries and acts on the uterus during pregnancy, so the hormone with which the identified band has the same site of action is likely to be a reproductive hormone. Adipocytes, bones, and the adrenal gland are not directly involved in reproductive processes, so the most likely answer is (D) Thyroid gland, as thyroxine is another hormone that is involved in regulating reproductive functions, although not directly related to progesterone."
