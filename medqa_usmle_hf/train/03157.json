The description of the headache suggests that it is a migraine, and the fact that the drug acts by inducing cerebral vasoconstriction indicates that it is likely an agonist of 5-HT1 receptors. This is a common mechanism of action for abortive migraine medications. Inhibition of \u03b21- and \u03b22-adrenergic receptors is a mechanism of action for beta-blockers, which are used for prophylaxis of migraines. Inhibition of 5-HT and NE reuptake is a mechanism of action for tricyclic antidepressants, which are also used for prophylaxis of migraines. Inhibition of voltage-dependent Na+ channels is a mechanism of action for antiarrhythmic drugs and anticonvulsants, but it is not commonly used for treatment of migraines."
