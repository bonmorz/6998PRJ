The absence of pulses in the right leg and diminished pulses in the left suggest involvement of the aortic arch. Intravenous morphine sulfate is started to manage pain, but the best next step in management is intravenous metoprolol to lower heart rate and blood pressure and reduce stress on the aorta. Intravenous hydralazine is not recommended due to the risk of reflex tachycardia and increased shear stress on the aorta. Oral aspirin can be given, but it is not the most urgent step at this time. D-dimer may be elevated in aortic dissection but is not specific and can be elevated in other conditions as well."

The symptoms, including sudden onset of severe chest pain that is described as tearing, along with a history of hypertension and smoking, suggest aortic dissection. The widened mediastinum on the chest X-ray further supports this diagnosis. The blood pressure readings in the right and left arms, as well as the absent and diminished pulses in the legs, suggest that this is a type A dissection involving the ascending aorta. Intravenous metoprolol is the best next step as beta-blockers can help lower the heart rate and blood pressure, reducing the risk of further complications. Intravenous hydralazine will also lower blood pressure, but its use may cause reflex tachycardia which can increase the risk of complications. Oral aspirin may be given, but it is not the best next step and may not have a significant impact on the patient's condition. D-dimer is not useful in the diagnosis or management of aortic dissection."
