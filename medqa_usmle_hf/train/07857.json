The presence of a diastolic \"plop\" at the cardiac apex suggests the possibility of left atrial myxoma, a benign tumor, causing obstructed blood flow, embolization or interference with valve function. Transthoracic echocardiography is therefore the most appropriate diagnostic tool to identify the presence of a left atrial pedunculated mass. Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction is unlikely since there were no findings of heart failure, and there is no mention of mitral regurgitation or prolapse to suggest a flail mitral valve leaflet. Patent foramen ovale may lead to right-to-left shunting and paradoxical embolism, but there is no mention of any hypercoagulable state or evidence of such on cardiac evaluation."

The presence of a diastolic \"plop\" at the cardiac apex suggests a left atrial pedunculated mass, which is usually seen in patients with infective endocarditis.

Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction is not usually associated with syncope, and the absence of a history of cardiac disease makes it unlikely. Patent foramen ovale is a common finding in the general population, and its presence alone is not usually associated with syncope."
