The patient's symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, dyspnea when lying down, and crackles heard in lungs suggest heart failure. The cardiac catheterization report ruled out coronary artery disease, making ischemic cardiomyopathy less likely. The mildly elevated liver and edema in lower extremities also suggest liver dysfunction, but no such abnormality was found in lab tests. The most likely cause of the individual's symptoms is toxic cardiomyopathy, possibly caused by his history of smoking and alcohol consumption."

The patient has symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and at rest, crackles in lungs, liver and extremity edema, and first-degree AV block on EKG. Cardiac catheterization from 5 years ago also showed a moderately enlarged heart. These symptoms suggest toxic cardiomyopathy, which can be caused by long-term alcohol use. The patient reports drinking \"a few\" drinks per night, which can contribute to toxic cardiomyopathy. Diastolic heart failure can also cause symptoms similar to the patient's, but the absence of hypertension and the presence of left ventricular enlargement on EKG suggest toxic cardiomyopathy as a more likely cause. Ischemic cardiomyopathy would show evidence of coronary artery disease on cardiac catheterization, which this patient did not have.

Diastolic heart failure is a type of heart failure that can occur in the presence of a normal ejection fraction which is not indicated in this case.
