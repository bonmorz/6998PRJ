Then, we look for the possible effects of a GATA1 mutation in Down syndrome individuals. According to a study published in the Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, children with Down syndrome and a GATA1 mutation have a higher risk of developing acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer. Celiac disease, congenital cataracts, and endocardial cushion defect are all associated with Down syndrome but not necessarily with a GATA1 mutation."
