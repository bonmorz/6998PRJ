If the second reading shows elevated blood pressure, then lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, exercise, and reducing sodium intake should be recommended before considering medication. Referral to a specialist or medication should only be considered if there is confirmed hypertension and lifestyle modifications do not result in improvement. Therefore, the best next step is to repeat the blood pressure measurement."

If the elevated blood pressure persists, referral to a specialist or treatment may be necessary. Providing reassurance alone would not be appropriate, as hypertension is a significant risk factor for several health complications. Treating with a thiazide diuretic would also not be appropriate as treatment should not be initiated based on a single elevated reading."
