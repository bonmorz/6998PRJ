Fluphenazine, a typical antipsychotic, is effective in reducing tics in Tourette syndrome patients. Baclofen, a GABA agonist, and Valproic acid, an anticonvulsant, have been used with limited success. Sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, may be helpful in treating comorbid conditions such as anxiety or depression but does not directly treat Tourette syndrome symptoms."
