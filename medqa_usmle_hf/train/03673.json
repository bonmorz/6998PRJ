The patient's glucose readings are high at night and in the morning, indicating a need for adjustment in insulin therapy.

Adding insulin glargine is another option but it may lead to hypoglycemia if not closely monitored. replacing lispro with insulin aspart or reducing a dose of lispro will not address the issue of high glucose readings at night and in the morning."
