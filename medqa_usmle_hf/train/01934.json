Phase III clinical trials are designed to confirm the safety and efficacy of a treatment in a larger patient population. Double-blind clinical trials are typically conducted during Phase III, where both the patients and the researchers are unaware of who receives the study drug or placebo. Therefore, SD27C is currently in Phase III of the clinical trial."
