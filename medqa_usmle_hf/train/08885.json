The symptoms, such as fatigue, lightheadedness, dizziness upon standing, and unintended weight loss, suggest that the most likely cause is autoimmune destruction. The patient has a history of hypoparathyroidism since she was a teenager, which suggests that she may have other autoimmune diseases as well. Tanned skin and sparse axillary and pubic hair can also be seen in autoimmune destruction. Abdominal neoplasia and occult hemorrhage are less likely to cause these symptoms. Amyloid deposition can cause weight loss, but it does not explain the other symptoms."
