The photograph of the patient\u2019s left ear shows a tophus, which is a deposit of uric acid crystals seen in patients with gout. The joint pain in his toes, ankles, and fingers also suggest gout. Therefore, a biopsy of the ear findings is most likely to show monosodium urate crystals. The kidney stones may be caused by high levels of uric acid in the urine which can contribute to calcium oxalate stone formation, but the biopsy is not likely to show calcium oxalate crystals. Ammonium magnesium phosphate crystals are associated with urinary tract infections and not typically seen in gout. Cholesterol crystals are associated with atherosclerotic plaque and not likely to be found in this case."
