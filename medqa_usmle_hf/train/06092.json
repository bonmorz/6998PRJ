FA is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that both parents must be carriers of the gene for their child to develop the condition. The risk of having another child with FA is 25%, which can be confirmed by genetic counseling and testing. Option (B) is incorrect as it suggests a much higher risk than what is known for FA. Option (C) is incorrect as FA is a genetic disorder and cannot be prevented through natural means. Option (D) is incorrect as the risk can be calculated through genetic testing and counseling."

Option B is incorrect as the risk of having another child with FA for carrier parents is 25%, not 66%."
