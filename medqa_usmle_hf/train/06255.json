Given the patient's history of urinary retention and recurrent UTIs, it is possible that he has an underlying condition such as diabetes or peripheral neuropathy, which can increase the risk of Achilles tendon injury. Switching medications and avoiding exercise can help reduce further damage and allow the tendon to heal. Referral to an orthopedic surgeon may be necessary if conservative management fails, but it is not the most important next step in management. MRI or CT scan may be helpful for diagnosis, but are not necessary as the patient's physical exam and medical history provide sufficient evidence for Achilles tendon injury."
