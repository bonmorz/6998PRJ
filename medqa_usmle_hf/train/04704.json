Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are characteristic laboratory findings in patients with GCA. Therefore, the next best step in the management of this patient is to perform an ESR to confirm the diagnosis. Lumbar puncture is not indicated in this case. Temporal artery biopsy can be performed to confirm the diagnosis, but it is invasive and can be deferred until after ESR results are obtained. Fundoscopic examination is not relevant to this particular clinical scenario."
