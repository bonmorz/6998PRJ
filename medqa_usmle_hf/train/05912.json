A CT angiogram is ordered for further evaluation, but before the procedure, the patient should receive normal saline to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to administer normal saline (C). Administering mannitol (A) may be used for reducing intracranial pressure, and administering ionic contrast (B) may be used for imaging studies, but these are not the immediate management for an arterial occlusion. Administering sodium bicarbonate (D) may be used to treat metabolic acidosis, but this is not indicated in this scenario."
