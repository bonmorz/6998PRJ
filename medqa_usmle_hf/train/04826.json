The nontender right flank mass and CT scan showing a renal mass suggest renal cell carcinoma, which is commonly associated with VHL gene mutations. The photomicrograph may further support this diagnosis, and molecular evaluation is most likely to show VHL gene deletion. The other options are associated with different genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis (NF1 gene inactivation), tuberous sclerosis (TSC1 gene insertion), and Wilms tumor (WT1 gene deletion)."
