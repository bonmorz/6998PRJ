The key features are chronic irritability and recurrent temper outbursts that are severe, developmental inappropriate and inconsistent with situation. The outbursts must occur three or more times a week for at least one year. Pediatric bipolar disorder may also have symptoms of irritability and temper outbursts, but it requires a history of manic or hypomanic episodes. Conduct disorder requires a persistent pattern of behavior that violates the rights of others and societal norms. Intermittent explosive disorder refers to recurrent outbursts of aggression that are out of proportion with the situation, and there is usually a sense of relief after the outburst."

Conduct disorder is also a possibility, but it is more commonly associated with aggressive behaviors outside of the home setting."
