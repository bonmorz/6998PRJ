The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), which is an acute transfusion reaction caused by fluid overload. The patient received 4 units of crossmatched packed red blood cells, which can cause volume overload in some patients. Symptoms of TACO include shortness of breath, chest pressure, crackles in the lungs, and hypertension. Other options such as Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction and Acute pulmonary embolism would have different symptoms such as rash, itching, or chest pain. Acute kidney injury would cause an increase in serum creatinine levels which is not present in this scenario."

Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction would cause immediate symptoms, while acute kidney injury would manifest with decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels. Acute pulmonary embolism would be unlikely in this scenario as there is no history of recent surgery or immobilization."
