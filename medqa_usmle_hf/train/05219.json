The pleural fluid analysis shows elevated protein concentration and normal LDH, indicating an exudative effusion. The most likely cause of an exudative effusion is an increased pulmonary capillary permeability, which can occur in many respiratory conditions including infections like pneumonia. Increased pulmonary capillary permeability allows plasma proteins to leak into the pleural space, leading to an exudative effusion."
