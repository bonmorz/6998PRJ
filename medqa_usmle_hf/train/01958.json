Medications used to treat PCOS, such as ketoconazole, inhibit desmolase, which is involved in the synthesis of androgens. Ketoconazole is also used to treat histoplasmosis. Therefore, option (B) desmolase is the correct answer."

The patient\u2019s symptoms of excess hair growth and irregular periods suggest Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), which can be treated with medications that lower androgen levels. Desmolase is required for steroid hormone synthesis and inhibiting it can lower androgen levels. Ketoconazole, the medication indicated in the treatment of histoplasmosis, is known to inhibit desmolase as well. Squalene epoxidase inhibitors are used in the treatment of fungal infections, not PCOS. Aromatase inhibitors and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are also used in treating hormonal imbalances, but they are not indicated in histoplasmosis treatment."
