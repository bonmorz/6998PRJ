The symptoms of fatigue, macrocytic anemia, and occasional hypersegmented neutrophils suggest pernicious anemia, which is caused by a deficiency of vitamin B12.

Lead poisoning, anemia due to chronic alcoholism, and Helicobacter pylori gastritis are less likely given the patient's medical history and other symptoms."

Lead poisoning can cause anemia but would not typically present with the other symptoms described. Chronic alcoholism can also cause anemia, but the patient's occasional alcohol use and well-balanced diet make this diagnosis less likely. Helicobacter pylori gastritis can cause anemia, but there is no evidence in the question to support this diagnosis."
