The patient\u2019s symptoms and medical history suggest that he may have esophageal candidiasis, which is common in HIV-positive patients. Fluconazole is the preferred treatment for esophageal candidiasis, as it has a good safety profile and is effective against Candida species. Esophageal endoscopy and biopsy may be performed if there is suspicion of other esophageal lesions or malignancy. Methylprednisolone is used for immune-related conditions, which are not suggested by the patient\u2019s presentation. Nystatin is also an antifungal, but it is not as effective against esophageal candidiasis as fluconazole."
