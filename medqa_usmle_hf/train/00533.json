The symptoms and drooping eyelids suggest myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder that results in muscle weakness. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase can help improve the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles and thus improve muscle strength, which is the main mechanism of action of drugs used to treat myasthenia gravis."

Thus, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (option A) is the most likely treatment to improve muscle strength. Stimulation of B2 adrenergic receptors (option B) may help with wheezing but not with muscle weakness. There is no evidence for autoantibodies or immune complexes, so option C is incorrect. Finally, reactivation of acetylcholinesterase (option D) is not enough to counteract the autoantibodies that are damaging the acetylcholine receptors."
