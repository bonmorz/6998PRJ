The presence of left-sided ptosis and anisocoria, along with the symptoms of severe pain in the left upper limb and vision problems in the left eye, all suggest Horner syndrome. The MRI image shows a left-sided cervical rib, which is causing compression of the brachial plexus and resulting in the patient's symptoms. The distribution of symptoms typically involves the ulnar nerve, which innervates the little finger. Therefore, numbness over the patient's left little finger would be the most likely focal neurologic deficit."

Based on the location of the lesion seen in the MRI image, the patient most likely has a cervical spinal cord lesion at the C7-T1 level on the left side. This lesion affects the ulnar nerve, which supplies sensation to the little finger. Therefore, the patient is most likely to experience numbness over her left little finger. The other options are not consistent with the location of the lesion. Crutch palsy refers to radial nerve compression at the axilla, which would not be affected by a cervical spinal cord lesion. Numbness over the thumb and index finger would be associated with more proximal lesions."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest thoracic outlet syndrome, and the MRI image shows compression of the left brachial plexus by a cervical rib. The brachial plexus contains nerve fibers that innervate muscles of the upper limb and hand. Compression of this nerve can cause numbness or tingling in the affected fingers. The nerve fibers that innervate the little finger are most likely to be affected due to their location in the brachial plexus. Therefore, numbness over the left little finger is the most likely focal neurologic deficit."
