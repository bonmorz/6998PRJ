The urine microalbumin to creatinine ratio test detects very small amounts of protein in the urine, indicating early renal impairment. Cystatin C levels can also be used to detect renal impairment, but it is not as sensitive as the microalbuminuria test. Hemoglobin A1C is a test used to monitor long-term blood sugar control, and urine protein dipstick test is less sensitive than the microalbuminuria test."
