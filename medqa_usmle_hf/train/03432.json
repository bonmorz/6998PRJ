The prior history of hypertension and hematuria suggest renal involvement, which can lead to the development of cerebral aneurysms. Increased wall tension within an aneurysm can cause it to rupture, leading to subarachnoid hemorrhage. The examination findings, including neck stiffness and resistance to knee extension, support the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Options B, C, and D are less likely causes of the patient\u2019s symptoms."

The patient's symptoms, including sudden onset excruciating headache, flank pain, hematuria, and hypertension, suggest a diagnosis of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. The resistance to knee extension and severe neck stiffness are indicative of meningeal irritation, likely due to subarachnoid hemorrhage from the ruptured aneurysm. Increased wall tension within an aneurysm can lead to rupture and subsequent subarachnoid hemorrhage. The other options are less likely to be the cause of this patient's presentation."

The patient\u2019s sudden onset excruciating headache and prior history of hypertension suggest a possible ruptured cerebral aneurysm. The neck stiffness and resistance to flexion are signs of meningeal irritation. Option A is correct as increased wall tension within an aneurysm can lead to its rupture and subsequent subarachnoid hemorrhage, which would explain the patient\u2019s presentation. Intracerebral hemorrhage due to vascular malformations is possible but not consistent with the patient\u2019s prior history of symptoms. Meningeal irritation from a space-occupying lesion could cause neck stiffness but would not explain the sudden onset of symptoms. Uremic encephalopathy from chronic renal disease is not consistent with the patient\u2019s clinical presentation."

The patient\u2019s resistance to extension of the knee upon flexion of his hip and knee, along with neck stiffness, suggests Kernig\u2019s sign, which is a sign of meningeal irritation. Therefore, (C) is a distractor answer. The uncle\u2019s history suggesting a familial tendency to aneurysm/thrombosis further supports option (A) as the best answer. Option (B) may also cause sudden onset headache, but with neurological deficits such as hemiparesis or sensory loss. Option (D) would not present with such sudden onset headache and neurological symptoms."

The sudden onset of an excruciating headache, a prior history of flank pain, hematuria, and hypertension in the patient, and similar symptoms in his uncle strongly suggest that the patient has a ruptured cerebral aneurysm, which is causing subarachnoid hemorrhage. The resistance to the subsequent extension of the knee is called the Brudzinski sign, which is a sign of meningitis caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage. Increased wall tension within an aneurysm is the most likely mechanism that led to this patient's presentation."

The sudden onset, severe headache, history of hypertension, and family history of similar symptoms suggest that the patient may be suffering from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. The neck stiffness, positive Kernig's sign (resisting knee extension with hip flexion) and Brudzinski's sign (involuntary flexion of hip and knees with neck flexion) suggest meningeal irritation causing meningismus, which often accompanies a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. Intracerebral hemorrhage and vascular malformations can cause headaches, but they do not typically present with meningismus. Uremic encephalopathy is unlikely given the acute onset of symptoms and lack of history of chronic renal disease."
