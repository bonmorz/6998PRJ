The periumbilical hematoma may suggest a pancreatic source. The lack of brain natriuretic peptide and normal oxygen saturation also support this mechanism, rather than embolic obstruction of pulmonary arteries or inflammation of the bronchial mucosa. Increased production of surfactant is not associated with ARDS secondary to pancreatitis."

Since the patient has a history of alcohol use disorder and presents with severe epigastric pain and nausea, acute pancreatitis is the most likely diagnosis. The periumbilical hematoma is indicative of acute pancreatitis-related arterial bleeding. The pulmonary findings are consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is caused by alveolocapillary membrane leakage. Thus, option (A) is the correct answer. Option (B) is incorrect because increased production of surfactant is associated with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, not ARDS. Option (C) is incorrect because embolic obstruction of pulmonary arteries is associated with pulmonary embolism, which is not likely in this case. Option (D) is incorrect because inflammation of the bronchial mucosa is associated with asthma and chronic bronchitis, not ARDS."
