Given the patient's symptoms of dyspnea and urticaria, along with wheezing on pulmonary auscultation, it is likely that she is experiencing an anaphylactic reaction, possibly related to shellfish allergy. Anaphylaxis can cause systemic release of complement components, including anaphylatoxins which induce chemotaxis and recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of antigen contact. Option A is therefore the correct answer. Complement components also have other functions, including clearance of immune complexes (Option B), direct cytolysis (Option C), and opsonization of pathogens (Option D), but these functions are not directly related to anaphylaxis."
