The patient's history suggests that the risk factor for the high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia detected is the age of sexual debut. This is because an earlier age of first sexual encounter is associated with a higher risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which is a known risk factor for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The other factors mentioned in the patient's history, such as her age, ovarian surgery, and history of cocaine abuse, are not known to be risk factors for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia."
