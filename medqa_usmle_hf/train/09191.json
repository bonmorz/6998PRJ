The patient's living will should be respected and followed, and the patient should not be intubated based on his wishes. Option A may be appropriate in certain situations, but it is not necessary in this case as the living will is clear. Option B also aligns with the patient's wishes but does not address the wishes of the family. Option D is incorrect as a patient's living will takes precedence over the wishes of next of kin. Therefore, option C is the best course of action."
