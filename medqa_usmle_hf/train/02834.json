The laboratory results show iron deficiency anemia and monoclonal protein on serum electrophoresis, which suggests the possibility of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The clonal bone marrow plasma cells comprise only 4% of the total number of cells, which rules out smoldering or symptomatic multiple myeloma. Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia would typically present with elevated serum viscosity or hyperviscosity syndrome. Further testing such as bone marrow biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of MGUS."
