The patient\u2019s symptoms and the presence of hepatomegaly and liver lesions suggests the possibility of liver cancer. Colonoscopy can help determine if the cancer originated in the colon and if there are any additional lesions. Surgical resection may not be necessary or feasible at this stage, and chemotherapy with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin may be considered after a definitive diagnosis. Antidepressants such as citalopram would not be the best next step in management in this case."
