The patient presents with symptoms of a possible miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, with an enlarged and irregular uterus and a partially open external os with a bulge. The lab findings show normal platelet count but slightly low hemoglobin and hematocrit, and normal coagulation tests, suggesting no bleeding disorder. The most likely cause of the symptoms is leiomyomata uteri, or uterine fibroids, which can cause painful and heavy menstrual bleeding, as well as an enlarged uterus with irregular shape. The joint pains and rashes may indicate an autoimmune disorder, but are not specific enough to suggest a certain diagnosis. Chromosomal abnormality is not a likely cause of the symptoms, and polycystic ovarian syndrome is not a likely cause of the enlarged uterus and vaginal bleeding."

The symptoms, including intense abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding with clots, joint pains, and an enlarged and irregularly shaped uterus with a partially open external os and a flesh-colored bulge, suggest Leiomyomata uteri (fibroids). The laboratory findings show normal coagulation factors (PT and PTT) and platelets, which rules out clotting or bleeding disorders. Adenomyosis is suspected when a uterus is uniformly enlarged, and chromosomal abnormalities usually cause repeated miscarriages. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is unlikely to cause such severe symptoms in early pregnancy."
