The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest hypertensive crisis, which can be caused by various conditions such as pheochromocytoma, renal artery stenosis, and drug interactions. The flushed skin, bright red retinal veins, and low bicarbonate indicate metabolic acidosis, which can be caused by excessive catecholamine release from the adrenal gland in a hypertensive crisis. None of the other options are consistent with the patient's presentation."
