Therefore, macrophages predominate in atherosclerotic plaques. Endothelial cells line the inner surface of blood vessels, T-cells are a type of white blood cell involved in the immune response, and neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that play a role in inflammation and fighting infections, but all these cells do not play a predominant role in atherosclerotic plaques."
