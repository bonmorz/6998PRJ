The patient\u2019s laboratory values suggest renal dysfunction, and her past medical history suggests a possible diagnosis of systemic sclerosis. The smooth skin also supports this diagnosis. Lithium can exacerbate kidney dysfunction and worsen sclerosis symptoms, so the best next step is to discontinue lithium and start an alternative medication, such as valproic acid. The other answer choices do not address the underlying condition and may even exacerbate the patient\u2019s symptoms."

Restarting the patient's home medications may not be appropriate and discontinuing lithium is necessary. Valproic acid can be used as an alternative to lithium for bipolar disorder. Therefore, the best next step in management would be to start valproic acid and discontinue lithium. Option A (starting metformin) is not appropriate as there is no indication of hyperglycemia. Option B (adding nifedipine) is not appropriate as there is already hypertension and adding another antihypertensive may cause hypotension. Option C (starting lisinopril and discontinuing captopril) is not appropriate as both medications are ACE inhibitors and should not be taken simultaneously."

The smooth skin and lack of age-related changes may suggest scleroderma. The patient currently takes lithium, which may contribute to renal disease, and the patient's anxiety and bipolar disorder suggest that valproic acid would be a good alternative. Therefore, the best next step in management would be to start valproic acid and discontinue lithium. Continuation of current medications or starting metformin would not address the potential renal failure or scleroderma.
