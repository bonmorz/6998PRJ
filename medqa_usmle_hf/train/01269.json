Risperidone can increase prolactin secretion and therefore cause decreased dopamine activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, leading to hyperprolactinemia. Options A and B suggest increased dopamine activity in the mesolimbic pathway, which is not related to prolactin secretion, and option D suggests increased dopamine activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, which would actually reduce prolactin secretion."

The decrease in dopamine activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway causes an increase in prolactin levels. Therefore, (C) is the correct answer."
