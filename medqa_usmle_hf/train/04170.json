Among the options, the most likely primary mechanism responsible for this is inhibition of NMDA receptors. This is commonly seen with the use of dissociative drugs such as phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine. The reduced degree of facial expression and muscle rigidity are also consistent with NMDA receptor antagonism."

Stimulation of cannabinoid receptors can cause hypertension and tachycardia, but not muscle rigidity or reduced facial expression. Stimulation of 5HT2A and dopamine D2 receptors can cause hallucinations and delusions, but not muscle rigidity or reduced facial expression. Inhibition of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine reuptake is a mechanism commonly used in antidepressant medications, which is not relevant to this case."

The patient's symptoms suggest she may be experiencing hallucinations and delusions, which are common symptoms of drug-induced psychosis. Among the options, inhibition of NMDA receptors is the most likely primary mechanism responsible for this patient's symptoms. This is because NMDA receptor antagonists, such as phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine, are known to induce psychosis-like symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and altered perception of reality. Stimulation of cannabinoid receptors and stimulation of 5HT2A and dopamine D2 receptors can cause some symptoms, but not all that the patient is experiencing. Inhibition of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine reuptake may cause agitation and muscle rigidity, but not hallucinations and delusions."
