This is caused by an obstruction in the portal vein, which causes blood to flow through the systemic circulation and form collaterals with the epigastric veins. The paraumbilical vein is not involved in this case. Option (B) is incorrect because anorectal varices are not associated with the rectal veins mentioned. Option (C) is incorrect because the azygos vein is not a portacaval anastomosis and esophageal varices are associated with the left gastric vein. Option (D) is incorrect because hemorrhoids are not associated with retroperitoneal veins or colic veins."
