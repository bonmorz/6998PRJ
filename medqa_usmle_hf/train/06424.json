Gemfibrozil is a fibric acid derivative which targets lipoprotein lipase, leading to increased breakdown of triglycerides and decreased production of VLDL. This ultimately leads to a decrease in serum triglycerides and an increase in HDL-cholesterol levels, which is the expected beneficial effect in this patient. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) upregulation of lipoprotein lipase. The other options are mechanisms of action of other lipid-lowering agents but are not relevant to gemfibrozil."

The elevated triglyceride levels suggest hypertriglyceridemia, which can be treated with fibric acid derivatives such as gemfibrozil. The mechanism of action involves upregulation of lipoprotein lipase, which increases the breakdown of triglycerides in circulating chylomicrons and VLDL particles. Option A is the mechanism of action for cholesterol absorption inhibitors, such as ezetimibe. Option B is incorrect because gemfibrozil activates PPAR-alpha, not inactivate it. Option D is incorrect because fibric acid derivatives do not directly affect bile acid metabolism."
