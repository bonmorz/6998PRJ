The patient has a fever for 10 days, multiple petechiae, and painless macules over both palms, which are suggestive of septic emboli. The patient also has a new grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the apex, which may indicate infective endocarditis, a common cause of septic emboli. The presence of retinal hemorrhages with white centers further supports the diagnosis of septic emboli. A ruptured saccular aneurysm or temporal encephalitis would present differently, and contiguous spread of infection does not explain the widespread manifestations seen in this patient."

The patient also has a new systolic murmur, which can be an indication of infective endocarditis. The retinal hemorrhages with white centers are known as Roth spots, which are also seen in infective endocarditis. Ruptured saccular aneurysm is less likely as there are no focal neurological deficits suggestive of a bleed. Temporal encephalitis and contiguous spread of infection are less likely as there are no signs of local infection on physical examination."
