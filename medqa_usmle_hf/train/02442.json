Inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis is the mechanism of action of isoniazid, which can cause peripheral neuropathy, but not visual disturbances. Inhibition of RNA synthesis and translation are the mechanisms of action of rifampin and aminoglycosides, respectively, which can cause other side effects but not visual disturbances."
