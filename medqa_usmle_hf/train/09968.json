The patient's significant facial flushing suggests a carcinoid tumor, which often produces hormones such as serotonin and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The patient's electrolyte imbalance and watery stools suggest a VIPoma, making option (D) the correct answer. VIPoma is also known as Verner-Morrison syndrome, which causes profuse diarrhea and electrolyte imbalances. Staining the intra-abdominal mass is not specific, but if it's a VIPoma, we would expect it to produce VIP."
