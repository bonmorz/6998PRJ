The patient's symptoms and history suggest coarctation of the aorta, which can cause recurrent nosebleeds, fatigue, headaches, and leg pain. The elevated blood pressure and a systolic murmur in the left paravertebral region also support this diagnosis. Delayed pulse in lower extremities is a common finding in coarctation of the aorta. Inferior rib notching is associated with aortic coarctation in older children and adults, but not typically seen in young children. Pulmonary valve stenosis and left-axis deviation on ECG are not typically associated with coarctation of the aorta."

The grade 2/6 murmur in the left paravertebral region is also consistent with coarctation of the aorta.

Inferior rib notching is commonly seen in older individuals with severe aortic coarctation, while pulmonary valve stenosis is not associated with coarctation of the aorta.
