The staining process described is Gram staining, which is a common laboratory technique used to differentiate bacterial species into two groups based on the characteristics of their cell walls. Gram-negative bacteria will appear pink or red, while Gram-positive bacteria will appear purple. The pink color seen on this stain indicates that the bacteria in the sputum sample are Gram-negative, and therefore they have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls. Peptidoglycan is a polymer made up of sugars and amino acids that is a key component of bacterial cell walls."

The staining procedure described is the Gram stain, which is used to differentiate between types of bacteria based on their cell wall composition. Gram-negative bacteria have a thinner peptidoglycan layer and contain lipopolysaccharides that cause them to stain pink or red. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) peptidoglycan.

The staining procedure described is the Gram stain, which is used to differentiate bacteria into gram-positive and gram-negative based on their cell wall properties. Gram-positive bacteria retain the crystal violet dye and appear purple, while gram-negative bacteria do not retain it and appear pink after application of the counterstain - safranin. Peptidoglycan is a component of the bacterial cell wall that is responsible for the retention of crystal violet dye in gram-positive bacteria. Therefore, peptidoglycan is responsible for the pink color seen on the stain in this case."

Gram-negative bacteria, which have a thinner peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane, do not retain the crystal violet stain and appear pink with the safranin counterstain. Therefore, the pink color seen on this stain is due to the acetone solution washing away the crystal violet stain from Gram-negative bacteria, allowing the safranin counterstain to show.
