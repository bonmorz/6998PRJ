The neurological symptoms and the downward fixed eyes suggest that the patient is suffering from a problem with the cerebellum, which is located near the fourth ventricle. However, nystagmus can also be a symptom of lesions in the pineal gland, which sits near the back of the brain above the thalamus. Since the option about the 4th ventricle is incorrect, the most likely answer is B, the pineal gland."

The symptoms described suggest that the patient has a problem with balance and coordination, which is associated with the cerebellum. The fact that the patient's eyes are fixed downwards and has nystagmus suggests damage to the pineal gland. The pineal gland is associated with the sleep-wake cycle, and disruption of this gland may cause insomnia. Therefore, the most likely structure affected by this patient's condition is the pineal gland."
