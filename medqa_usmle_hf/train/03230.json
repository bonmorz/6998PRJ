The patient's symptoms suggest glucagonoma syndrome, which is a rare tumor of the alpha cells of the pancreas that produces excessive glucagon. Skin lesions, stomatitis, and diarrhea are common symptoms. Serum glucagon levels are increased in patients with glucagonoma syndrome, making it the most likely test to yield an accurate diagnosis. Serum gastrin is associated with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, but the patient does not present with symptoms of this disease. Serum insulin is associated with insulinoma, which presents with hypoglycemia, not hyperglycemia like the patient. Serum vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is associated with VIPoma, which presents with watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria. The patient does present with diarrhea, but there is no mention of hypokalemia or achlorhydria in the explanation."
