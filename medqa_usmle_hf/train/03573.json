Diversion of blood flow from stenotic coronary arteries can cause ischemia and lead to ST depression on ECG. Transient atrioventricular nodal blockade and reduced left ventricular preload do not typically cause ST depression, and increased myocardial oxygen demand is more likely to cause ST elevation on ECG."

The adenosine stress test helps diagnose myocardial ischemia by increasing cardiovascular workload, increasing oxygen demand, and causing coronary blood vessels to dilate. The new ST depression in leads V2, V3, and V4 suggests that blood flow is being diverted from stenotic coronary arteries supplying these areas, leading to myocardial ischemia. Options B, C, and D are not the most important underlying mechanisms."

The patient's symptoms and ECG changes suggest myocardial ischemia, and the most common cause of myocardial ischemia is reduced blood flow through stenotic coronary arteries. Transient AV nodal blockade can cause heart block, but this is not likely in this patient as his ECG shows only a right bundle branch block and premature ventricular contractions. Reduced left ventricular preload would lead to decreased cardiac output and may cause symptoms but is unlikely to cause ST depression. Increased myocardial oxygen demand could exacerbate the symptoms but would not be the underlying mechanism of the ECG changes."
