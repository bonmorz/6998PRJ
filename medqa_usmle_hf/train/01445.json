Since the patient has a history of urticaria following antibiotic treatment, it is important to choose an antibiotic that is less likely to cause an allergic reaction. Azithromycin is a good option for patients with a known penicillin allergy. Tympanocentesis may be considered if there is no improvement after antibiotic treatment or for severe cases, but it is not the first-line option. Topical hydrocortisone and gentamicin eardrops are not the appropriate treatment for acute otitis media. Otic ofloxacin therapy may be used in patients with a perforated tympanic membrane but is not the first-line option for a non-perforated tympanic membrane."

The patient has symptoms of otitis media with bulging tympanic membrane, which is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae. Given the patient\u2019s history of atopic dermatitis and urticaria, topical hydrocortisone should be avoided as it can worsen the infection and gentamicin can cause ototoxicity. Otic ofloxacin can be used, but oral antibiotics are preferred for more severe cases. Tympanocentesis is not recommended as it is invasive and not routinely done in uncomplicated cases. Oral azithromycin is the most appropriate choice as it covers both S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, and it is often used as a first-line agent in cases of acute otitis media."
