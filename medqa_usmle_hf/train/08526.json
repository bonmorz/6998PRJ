In cases of non-thyroidal illness (such as pneumonia), there is a decrease in T3 hormone production and an increase in reverse T3 production, leading to a high reverse T3:T3 ratio. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be an increased reverse T3 concentration. Free T3 concentration may or may not be affected depending on the severity of illness."

The patient's decreased T3 levels suggest a low T3 syndrome, which can be caused by nonthyroidal illness such as pneumonia. In this syndrome, reverse T3 levels are often increased as a result of the body's attempt to conserve energy during illness. Free T3 levels may be decreased or normal, but not increased. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer."
