The drug that would slow the phase 0 upswing and increase the duration of the action potential is procainamide, which is used to treat ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. It would be administered to control ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of an acute MI. Flecainide and Mexiletine are not effective for controlling ventricular arrhythmias during AMI. Timolol is a beta-blocker and is not effective for controlling ventricular arrhythmias during AMI."
