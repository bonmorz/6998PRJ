The described process is known as lysogenic conversion, the process by which a bacterium acquires a new phenotype by integration of a prophage. Corynebacterium diphtheriae is known to cause diphtheria. The toxin-producing genes of C. diphtheriae are located on a lysogenic bacteriophage. Incorporation of this phage genetic information into the bacterial genome makes it more pathogenic. None of the other options are known to have lysogenic conversion as a mechanism of pathogenicity."
