Terazosin is an alpha-blocker commonly used to treat BPH by relaxing the smooth muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urine flow and reducing urinary frequency. Phenoxybenzamine is used to treat hypertension caused by pheochromocytoma. Tamsulosin is also used to treat BPH but is more selective for the alpha-1A receptor subtype, which is predominately found in the prostate. Alpha-methyldopa is a centrally acting antihypertensive medication, but is not commonly used for BPH."
