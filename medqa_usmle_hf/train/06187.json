The patient's symptoms, including back pain, abdominal bloating, and a feeling of constipation, do not suggest a malignant neoplasm. The absence of neurological symptoms and abnormal laboratory findings also support this. The patient's extensive online research and anxiety about pancreatic cancer suggest somatic symptom disorder, which is characterized by persistent and distressing physical symptoms that are not fully explained by medical conditions. The patient's history of episodic chest pain and pressure from work also suggest a possible underlying psychological component, such as atypical depression. Acute stress disorder may be considered if the onset of symptoms was directly related to a traumatic event, but this is not supported by the patient's history."

Somatic symptom disorder, however, can cause chronic pain and gastrointestinal symptoms in the absence of a clear underlying medical cause, and is often associated with stress and anxiety. It is the most likely explanation for this patient\u2019s symptoms."

Malignant neoplasm is unlikely based on the presented history, and the absence of neurological symptoms or morning stiffness rules out inflammatory or degenerative diseases. Atypical depression and acute stress disorder may be considered as differential diagnoses, but the presented symptoms do not meet the criteria for either of these conditions."
