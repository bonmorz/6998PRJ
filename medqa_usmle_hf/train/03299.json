Given her medical history and recent surgery, there is a higher likelihood of pulmonary embolism, but myocardial infarction should also be ruled out. ECG and troponin levels can help diagnose or rule out a cardiovascular event. Pantoprazole is used to treat GERD and endoscopy is not indicated in this case. Discontinuing levothyroxine may exacerbate the patient's thyroid levels and should be avoided. Levofloxacin and chest radiograph are also not helpful in diagnosing the cause of the patient's symptoms."
