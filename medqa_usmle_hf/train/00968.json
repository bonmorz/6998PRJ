The peripheral blood smear shows microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells which suggests iron-deficiency anemia. A decrease in reticulocyte count is associated with iron-deficiency anemia as the bone marrow decreases the production of red blood cells due to insufficient iron. Erythropoietin levels may be increased in this condition as the body tries to compensate for the anemia. Increased white blood cell count and thrombocytopenia are not typically associated with iron-deficiency anemia."

The patient presents with symptoms of anemia, including marked conjunctival pallor and microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells, along with fatigue and shortness of breath. The low hematocrit and hemoglobin levels confirm the diagnosis of anemia. The most likely cause of this anemia in an elderly African American woman is iron deficiency anemia, which is often caused by chronic blood loss. A decrease in reticulocyte count would be expected in this patient because the bone marrow is not producing enough red blood cells to keep up with the blood loss.

The patient\u2019s symptoms and laboratory values suggest anemia, which is confirmed by the microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells on the blood smear. A reticulocyte count can help determine if the bone marrow is responding appropriately to the anemia. A decrease in reticulocyte count suggests ineffective erythropoiesis, such as iron deficiency anemia, whereas an increase in reticulocyte count suggests a hemolytic anemia. Erythropoietin levels may be decreased, but this is not the most likely finding in this patient. Increased white blood cell count or thrombocytopenia are less likely based on the laboratory values provided."
