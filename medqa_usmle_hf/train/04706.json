The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and nausea, along with a rigid and tender uterus on pelvic examination, suggests abruptio placentae. The cervical dilation and fetal heart rate also support this diagnosis. Ruptured uterus and vasa previa may present with similar symptoms but the pelvic examination findings do not fit. Placenta accreta typically presents with painless bleeding in the third trimester, while this patient has severe abdominal pain."

The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and nausea, along with a rigid, tender uterus and vaginal bleeding, suggest abruption placentae as the most likely diagnosis. The other options may cause bleeding but are less likely to present with the characteristic pain and uterine tenderness. Additionally, the fetal heart rate of 100/min may indicate fetal distress, which can also be a result of abruptio placentae."

Ruptured uterus and ruptured vasa previa are less likely to cause these symptoms, and placenta accreta is unlikely at 32 weeks' gestation."
