The low TSH level and fine tremor confirm the diagnosis. Propylthiouracil is a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism in pregnant women. Lugol's iodine can be used prior to thyroidectomy to decrease thyroid hormone levels and prevent complications. Atenolol is a beta blocker that can help lower heart rate and blood pressure, but it does not address the underlying thyroid dysfunction. Thyroidectomy may be considered if medical management is not effective, but it is not the first-line option in this case."

The enlarged thyroid gland and the midsystolic click with murmur suggest Graves' disease. The serum TSH concentration is decreased, which is consistent with hyperthyroidism. The most appropriate medication for management is an anti-thyroid agent, such as propylthiouracil, which inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis. Lugol's iodine can be given before thyroidectomy to decrease thyroid hormone production and vascularity. Thyroidectomy may be considered in some cases, but it is not the first-line treatment for Graves' disease. Atenolol is a beta-blocker that can control the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, but it does not treat the underlying disease."
