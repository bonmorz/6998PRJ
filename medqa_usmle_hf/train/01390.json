Based on the given history, the patient seems to be exhibiting normal teenage behavior, which can include mood swings, conflicts with parents, and changes in behavior and interests. Oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder usually involve more serious and persistent behavior problems, while antisocial personality disorder requires a long-term pattern of manipulation and violation of others' rights. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is normal behavior."
