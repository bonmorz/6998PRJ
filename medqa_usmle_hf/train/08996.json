The patient\u2019s symptoms of occasional anxiety with a pounding headache, racing heart, and sweating also suggest medullary carcinoma, as it can cause symptoms related to the release of excess catecholamines. Anaplastic carcinoma is rare and aggressive and presents with a rapidly growing neck mass. Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and is typically slow-growing, but it does not present with excess catecholamines. Follicular adenoma is a benign tumor of the thyroid and would not present with excess catecholamines."

The patient\u2019s symptoms of anxiety and physical appearance may also be consistent with MEN 2B. Anaplastic carcinoma is highly aggressive and rapidly progresses, which doesn\u2019t fit with the patient\u2019s history of a stable nodule. Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer, but its presentation is typically a painless nodule that grows slowly over years. Follicular adenoma is a benign tumor and it\u2019s most commonly asymptomatic."
