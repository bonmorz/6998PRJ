The symptoms and laboratory findings suggest that the most likely diagnosis is Kawasaki disease, which is an acute febrile illness of unknown cause that primarily affects children younger than 5 years of age. The characteristic signs include fever, rash, conjunctivitis, erythema of the palms and soles, cervical lymphadenopathy, and mucous membrane changes. Laboratory findings typically include leukocytosis with neutrophilia, anemia, thrombocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and elevated CRP. Treatment includes intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and high-dose aspirin. Scarlet fever would present with a sandpaper-like rash and a strawberry tongue. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis would not present with the characteristic findings of Kawasaki disease. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome would present with blistering of the skin, which is not present in this case."
