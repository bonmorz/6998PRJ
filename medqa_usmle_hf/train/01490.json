The presence of red ragged fibers on muscle biopsy suggests a mitochondrial disorder, which is generally inherited maternally. Therefore, if the mother is affected, all of her children will have a chance of being affected, with varying degrees of severity. Option A is the most accurate answer, as it acknowledges that the other son will have a 100% chance of being affected but the severity may be different. Option C is incorrect as the severity of mitochondrial disorders can vary even among siblings with the same genetic mutation. Option B is not accurate as mitochondrial disorders are inherited maternally, and option D is not accurate as the likelihood of a 50/50 chance of being affected only applies to conditions inherited through autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance."

The severity may differ due to various factors, such as penetrance and expressivity.

Based on the presumptive diagnosis of a genetic disease and the fact that the mother has two sons, there is a high likelihood that this is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that both parents carry one copy of the mutated gene but are unaffected themselves. Each child has a 25% chance of inheriting two copies of the mutated gene and being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier like the parents, and a 25% chance of inheriting two normal copies of the gene and being unaffected. Therefore, while there is a 100% chance that the other son is a carrier, there is also a 25% chance he will be affected, although the severity may differ."

Red ragged fibers are a characteristic finding in mitochondrial diseases, which are typically caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Inherited mtDNA mutations are typically maternally inherited, so if the mother carries the mutation, then all her children will be at risk of inheriting it, with a 100% chance of transmission. However, the severity and age of onset of the disease can vary in affected individuals. Therefore, the correct response is that there is a 100% chance that the other son will be affected but the severity may be different."
