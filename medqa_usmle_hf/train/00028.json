The symptoms suggest cranial neuropathy and the physical exam photo shows ptosis of the right eyelid and a dilated and poorly reactive right pupil, which suggests involvement of the third cranial nerve. MR angiography of the head can determine if an aneurysm or other vascular abnormality is causing the symptoms. Direct fundoscopy and intraocular pressures can be helpful in assessing for other eye conditions but would not be able to diagnose the underlying cause of the cranial neuropathy. Temporal artery biopsy is used to diagnose giant cell arteritis, which typically presents with headache and jaw claudication, and is not a likely diagnosis in this case."
