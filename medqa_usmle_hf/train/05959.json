The presented symptoms, including bright red blood in the toilet bowl and a positive fecal occult blood test, suggest gastrointestinal bleeding.

Anoscopy only visualizes the distal rectum, while barium enema has lower sensitivity and specificity compared to colonoscopy. Upper endoscopy is not necessary since the source of bleeding is likely in the colon or rectum."
