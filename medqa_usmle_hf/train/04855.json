The new growth medium contains no free uracil, which means that the cells cannot synthesize de novo pyrimidines. Instead, they rely on salvage pathways to generate the nucleotides required for DNA replication. This means that the cells will utilize the available radiolabeled thymine in the growth medium for DNA replication, and the rate of incorporation will reflect the rate of replication. The enzyme directly affected by the new medium is Primase, which is responsible for synthesizing short RNA primers that are required for DNA replication. Without the ability to synthesize de novo pyrimidines, the cells cannot make the RNA primers required for DNA replication, and the rate of incorporation of radiolabeled thymine will decrease."

The addition of uracil would affect the function of DNA polymerase I, which has a 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease activity that removes RNA primers from the Okazaki fragments and adds dNTPs to replace them with DNA. However, the growth medium contains no free uracil, indicating that the function of DNA polymerase I is not affected. Telomerase is not involved in DNA replication in prokaryotes, and ligase is involved in joining the Okazaki fragments together, but is not affected by the absence of free uracil in the growth medium. The absence of free uracil would affect the function of primase, which synthesizes short RNA primers that are used by DNA polymerase III to initiate DNA synthesis. Without free uracil, primase would be unable to synthesize RNA primers, which would decrease the rate of DNA replication."

The presence of free uracil in the growth medium can inhibit the function of DNA polymerase, but not the other enzymes listed. However, since the growth medium in question contains no free uracil, the answer must be a different enzyme. During DNA replication, primase is responsible for synthesizing RNA primers, which are necessary for the initiation of DNA synthesis. Without RNA primers, DNA replication cannot occur, so the suspension of cells in a new growth medium that contains no free uracil would directly affect the function of primase by preventing the formation of these RNA primers."
