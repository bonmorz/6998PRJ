The patient has a history of preeclampsia in her previous pregnancy but her symptoms and lab results are more consistent with acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP). The elevated liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, and coagulopathy are typical findings in AFLP, and the flapping tremor in her hands suggests hepatic encephalopathy. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy may also present with jaundice and itching but is not as severe as AFLP. Acute viral hepatitis is unlikely given the negative serologies."

The symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and yellowish discoloration of the sclera suggest acute fatty liver of pregnancy, which can also cause hepatic encephalopathy and bleeding disorders.

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy can cause itching and elevated levels of liver enzymes, but not hepatic encephalopathy or bleeding disorders. Acute viral hepatitis B can cause fever, fatigue, jaundice, and elevated levels of liver enzymes, but not hepatic encephalopathy or bleeding disorders."
