The enzyme is located in the mitochondria and requires acetyl CoA as a substrate. Therefore, an increase in acetyl CoA (option D) would be the most likely to increase the activity of this enzyme. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (option A) activates the enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase, which inhibits the activity of pyruvate carboxylase to decrease gluconeogenesis. Glucagon (option B) stimulates gluconeogenesis by activating enzymes such as fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase, but it does not directly affect pyruvate carboxylase. Oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) (option C) is an electron carrier in metabolism and does not have a direct effect on pyruvate carboxylase activity."
