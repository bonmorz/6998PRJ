The fact that the patient has recurrent episodes of color changes in his fingers when exposed to the cold suggests a diagnosis of Raynaud's phenomenon. The nodules on the left foot with surrounding erythema that follow the course of the lateral marginal vein suggest erythema nodosum, which can be associated with various underlying conditions such as infections or inflammatory diseases, but can also occur in patients with malignancies or vascular disorders such as polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Biopsy of the dorsalis pedis artery will most likely show segmental thrombosing inflammation with sparing of the internal elastic lamina, which is a characteristic finding in PAN."

The patient's symptoms suggest a diagnosis of Buerger's disease, which is characterized by segmental thrombosing inflammation involving the small and medium-sized arteries in the extremities.
