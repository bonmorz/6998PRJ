Bartter\u2019s syndrome, on the other hand, results in excess salt and fluid being excreted in the urine, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Bartter\u2019s syndrome does not affect calcium secretion, ADH action or urine concentration."

Secretion of calcium occurs in the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting ducts of the nephron. The site of action of ADH is the collecting ducts, where it regulates water reabsorption. The concentration of urine is also regulated by the collecting ducts, but not specifically by the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter in the thick ascending limb. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) impermeability to water."
