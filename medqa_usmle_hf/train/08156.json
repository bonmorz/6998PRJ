Bicuspid aortic valve may have a systolic murmur but not a diastolic rumble. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may present with dyspnea but typically has a harsh systolic murmur.

The lack of changes in the splitting of S2 with inspiration suggests that the cause of the murmur is not pulmonic stenosis.

Further testing, such as an echocardiogram, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis."
