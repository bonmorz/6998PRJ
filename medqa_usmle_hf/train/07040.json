                "content": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. The patient's symptoms suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), possibly due to exposure to second-hand smoke. Pulmonary function testing in patients with COPD typically shows decreased FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) and decreased FEV1/FVC ratio (ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity), indicating airway obstruction. Increased TLC (total lung capacity) is also typical in patients with COPD. DLCO (diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide) may be normal or decreased in COPD, but the patient's symptoms and history suggest that a decrease in DLCO is less likely. Therefore, option (B) is the most likely set of results in this patient."

The expected results of pulmonary function testing in COPD include decreased FEV1, decreased FEV1/FVC ratio, and increased TLC, but the DLCO may be normal. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. The presence of end-expiratory wheezes and a barrel chest also support the diagnosis of COPD. The blue tint to the patient's lips and mucous membranes suggests cyanosis, which can occur in severe COPD due to decreased oxygenation."

Option B is the correct answer as it reflects the characteristic pattern seen in COPD: decreased FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio with increased TLC and normal DLCO. Option A is seen in restrictive lung diseases. Option C shows decreased TLC and decreased DLCO, which is not characteristic of COPD. Option D shows an increased FEV1/FVC ratio, which is not seen in COPD."
