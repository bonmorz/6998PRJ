This redistribution can cause ischemia and angina symptoms, which could explain the patient\u2019s recurrent chest pain.

Coronary steal occurs when the blood flow is diverted away from stenotic vessels towards normal vessels with increased blood flow, leading to decreased blood flow and ischemia in the stenotic vessels, and can cause chest pain.
