Sodium bicarbonate can be used to treat acidosis in patients with salicylate overdose but is not indicated for lithium toxicity. Hemodialysis is the treatment of choice for severe lithium toxicity and elevated lithium levels greater than 4 mEq/L. Therefore, the next step in management for this patient is hemodialysis."

Lithium toxicity can cause altered mental status, hyperreflexia, tremors, and nystagmus, all of which the patient is exhibiting.
