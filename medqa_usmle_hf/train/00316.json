Serology for human herpesvirus-6 IgM antibodies is used for diagnosing Human herpesvirus-6.

For example, measles virus infection usually causes conjunctivitis and Koplik spots in the mouth. Human herpesvirus-6 infection may cause roseola with high fever followed by a rash, but the rash usually starts on the trunk. Rubella virus infection usually causes a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the trunk and extremities."
