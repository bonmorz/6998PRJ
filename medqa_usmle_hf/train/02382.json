Evaluating nocturnal tumescence can help differentiate between psychological and physiological causes of erectile dysfunction. If there is nocturnal erections, then the cause is likely psychological, and counseling or therapy may be more appropriate than medication. If there are no nocturnal erections, then the cause is likely physiological, and medication such as sildenafil or vardenafil may be appropriate. However, performing a duplex penile ultrasound would not be the first step in this case."

This can be achieved by a simple test that involves wearing a ring-like device around the penis at night to measure erections during sleep. Once the cause of the problem is determined, treatment options can then be discussed. Prescribing medication is not the first step in evaluation and should only be considered after further testing and evaluation."
