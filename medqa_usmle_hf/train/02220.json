Medications, especially ototoxic drugs used to treat these conditions, can cause hearing loss. The Weber test not localizing to either ear and the Rinne test demonstrating air conduction louder than bone conduction suggests a sensorineural hearing loss, which can be caused by ototoxic drugs."

The patient\u2019s medical history of hypertension and diabetes may suggest the use of ototoxic medications."

The patient's recent use of antibiotics by his grandson suggests that the patient may be experiencing hearing loss from toxicity due to medication. This possibility is further supported by the lack of localization on the Weber test and the positive Rinne test. Presbycusis and otitis externa are unlikely given the patient's recent onset of symptoms, and otitis media would be unlikely to present with decreased hearing bilaterally."

The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, as well as his medication regimen, put him at risk for drug-induced hearing loss. Furthermore, his recent exposure to his grandson who is taking antibiotics for ear pain raises suspicion for ototoxicity. The Weber and Rinne tests suggest sensorineural hearing loss, which is commonly associated with drug-induced hearing loss. Otitis externa and otitis media would typically present with symptoms such as pain, discharge, and fever, none of which are mentioned in the question stem. Presbycusis, or age-related hearing loss, is possible, but the sudden onset and bilateral nature of the symptoms make medication-induced hearing loss more likely."

Otitis externa and media can cause conductive hearing loss, which is not shown in this patient with normal Rinne and Weber tests.
