The patient presented with an enlarged liver, frequent episodes of weakness and sweating, and laboratory results indicate low blood glucose and high lactate and ketones. These are all indicative of Von-Gierke's disease, which is caused by a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase leading to impaired glycogenolysis. The enzyme assay performed on the liver biopsy tissue revealed very low glucose-6-phosphatase levels, further supporting this diagnosis. Cori's disease and McArdle disease are caused by defects in glycogen metabolism, but the enzyme deficiency involved is different from that in Von-Gierke's disease. Pompe's disease is caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase, leading to the accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes of various tissues. This patient's liver biopsy indicated that the hepatic glycogen structure was normal, making Pompe's disease less likely."

The patient's symptoms, including frequent weakness eliminated by eating, slow development, and enlarged liver with high glycogen content, suggest Von-Gierke's disease, which is a type of glycogen storage disease. The low glucose-6-phosphatase levels in the enzyme assay confirm this diagnosis. Cori's disease also causes glycogen accumulation in the liver, but it results from a deficiency in debranching enzyme. Pompe's disease and McArdle disease are caused by deficiencies in lysosomal alpha-glucosidase and muscle glycogen phosphorylase, respectively, and are not associated with the symptoms and liver findings seen in this patient."
