The patient has a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking, which puts her at risk for small vessel disease. The presence of left-sided weakness suggests a lesion in the right hemisphere of the brain. The absence of sensory deficits suggests a subcortical lesion rather than a cortical lesion. The most likely cause of these findings is lipohyalinosis of lenticulostriate arteries. Atherosclerosis of the internal carotid artery would cause symptoms in the middle cerebral artery territory, such as aphasia or neglect. Dissection of the vertebral artery would cause symptoms in the posterior circulation, such as vertigo or ataxia. Embolism from the left atrium would cause symptoms in multiple territories, not just the right hemisphere."

The patient\u2019s risk factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease) suggest that atherosclerosis of the internal carotid artery could be a possibility, but the examination findings suggest otherwise. The left-sided weakness and facial droop point towards a lesion in the right hemisphere, and the decreased muscle strength, along with the 3+ deep tendon reflexes on the left, suggests an acute ischemic event. The most common cause of such an event is small vessel disease, due to lipohyalinosis of the lenticulostriate arteries. Dissection of the vertebral artery would present with vertebrobasilar ischemia, and embolism from the left atrium would present with multiple areas of infarction, not just on one side."

Atherosclerosis of the internal carotid artery may cause more global or cortical deficits, while dissection of the vertebral artery usually leads to posterior circulation symptoms. Aspirin is also used to prevent embolism from the left atrium, but in this case it is less likely due to the unilateral nature of the symptoms."
