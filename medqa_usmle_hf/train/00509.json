Northern blot and fluorescence in-situ hybridization are used for detecting gene expression and chromosomal abnormalities, respectively, and are not appropriate for detecting CD117-positive cells."

CD117 is a protein encoded by the c-kit gene that is normally present on the surface of gastrointestinal stromal tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the gold standard for CD117 detection in tissue samples, using antibodies to specifically bind to CD117 and allow visualization of the stained cells. Flow cytometry is typically used to analyze individual cells in suspension, and Northern blot and fluorescence in-situ hybridization are not applicable to CD117 detection. Therefore, the most appropriate test for determining the spatial distribution of CD117-positive cells in biopsy specimens is immunohistochemistry."
