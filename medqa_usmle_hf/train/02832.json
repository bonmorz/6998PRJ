Among the options, only interference with action of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) on intracellular calcium release is a mechanism of action of an antihypertensive medication, specifically calcium channel blockers. However, it is important to note that the answer option in the question does not specify a specific medication, making it difficult to determine which calcium channel blocker was used."
