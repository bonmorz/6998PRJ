The erosion of the right gastric artery suggests bleeding from the ulcer. The location of the perforation determines which artery will be affected. The most common location for peptic ulcers is the anterior duodenum, but the right gastric artery would not be involved. The posterior duodenum has the risk of perforating the gastroduodenal artery. The greater curvature of the stomach would involve the left gastroepiploic artery. Therefore, the most likely location of the ulcer causing the erosion of the right gastric artery is the lesser curvature of the stomach."
