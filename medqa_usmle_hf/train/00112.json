The physical examination shows a displaced apical impulse, which is caused by left ventricular hypertrophy or decreased compliance of the left ventricle. Among the options, only (A) refers specifically to the left ventricle. Myxomatous degeneration is associated with mitral valve prolapse, but this would not cause a displaced apical impulse. Inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis) would cause a pericardial friction rub, not a displaced apical impulse. Dilation of the aortic root would cause a widened pulse pressure and not necessarily a displaced apical impulse."
