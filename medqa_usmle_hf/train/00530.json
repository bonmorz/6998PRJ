The patient\u2019s symptoms and chest radiography results suggest acute pulmonary edema, which can be treated with medications such as diuretics. Option (A), (C), and (D) are not properties of diuretics. Option (B) is a property of diuretics, where they cause venodilation and a decrease in preload, leading to a decrease in fluid volume and thus relieving symptoms of acute heart failure. However, the patient\u2019s repeat chest radiography still shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette, suggesting that the medication did not have a long-term effect, as diuretics do not lead to long-term adaptations such as reducing the size of the heart. Therefore, option (D) is the best answer."
