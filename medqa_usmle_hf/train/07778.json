The presentation of midfacial hypoplasia, infraorbital creases, large tongue, and asymmetric body is consistent with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome. The protruding abdominal viscera is an omphalocele, and enlarged kidneys suggest organomegaly. As surgical closure of the abdominal wall is planned, serial abdominal ultrasonography is necessary to assess for any progression of organomegaly or other abnormalities. Serum IGF-1 measurement can be used to diagnose growth hormone deficiency but does not play a role in managing this patient's condition. Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone measurement can be used to screen for congenital adrenal hyperplasia but is not necessary in this case. Cranial MRI is not indicated as there are no neurological symptoms or signs."

The newborn\u2019s symptoms suggest Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or omphalocele, both of which are associated with enlarged organs and protruding abdominal viscera at the umbilicus. Since the newborn has enlarged kidneys, serial abdominal ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step in management. Serum IGF-1 measurement can be used to confirm Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone measurement can be used to rule out congenital adrenal hyperplasia, but neither would be indicated as the next step in management.

The newborn appears to have Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which is associated with abdominal wall defects, visceromegaly, hypoglycemia, and midfacial hypoplasia, among other features.

Serum IGF-1 measurement is not needed for the diagnosis or management of this condition. Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone measurement is for congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which presents with ambiguous genitalia in females and salt-wasting in males, but is not suggested by the clinical findings here.
