The patient\u2019s symptoms and physical examination suggest tension-type headache, which is a type of primary headache. Primary headaches do not have any identifiable underlying cause or pathology, and imaging studies are not recommended unless there are atypical features. Therefore, the next best step in management would be to recommend lifestyle changes, relaxation techniques, and massage therapy as tension-type headaches are often triggered or aggravated by stress, poor posture, and muscle tension. Option C represents treatment for acute migraine headache and should not be given for tension-type headache, which is a different type of headache.  Options A and B are not indicated as there are no concerning features that suggest a structural abnormality."

The patient likely has tension-type headache, which can be triggered by stress or tension in the muscles of the neck and scalp. The absence of visual and auditory disturbances, nausea, vomiting, and neurological deficits makes it less likely to be a more serious condition such as migraine or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Thus, lifestyle changes, relaxation techniques, and massage therapy can be recommended as initial management. Imaging studies such as non-contrast CT or MRI are generally not indicated for tension-type headache unless there are atypical features. Medications such as ibuprofen and sumatriptan may provide symptom relief but should be considered on a case-by-case basis."

Option C may be considered if the headache becomes severe or frequent, but it is not the initial management for an occasional tension-type headache."
