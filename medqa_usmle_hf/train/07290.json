Recent semen analysis of her husband showed normal sperm count, ruling out male factor infertility. The patient's menstrual history suggests regular ovulation, ruling out primary ovarian insufficiency. The patient's BMI indicates obesity, which can be a risk factor for some causes of infertility, such as polycystic ovary syndrome. However, the patient has no other symptoms of this condition. The patient\u2019s history of a febrile illness with lower abdominal pain, along with her inconsistent use of barrier protection during prior sexual encounters suggests a possible history of sexually transmitted infection, which can lead to tubal scarring and infertility. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's infertility is tubal scarring."

Long-term use of the oral contraceptive pill has not been shown to cause infertility. Primary ovarian insufficiency would typically present with irregular or absent menstrual cycles.

Long-term use of oral contraceptive pills does not cause infertility, but it may delay a return to ovulation after discontinuation. Primary ovarian insufficiency is a possibility, but less likely given the regular menstrual cycles. Overall, the history of a febrile illness and the absence of other findings indicating a different cause of infertility make tubal scarring the most likely cause in this patient."
