The patient has stage 2 chronic kidney disease and a 24-hour urine specimen with proteinuria, indicating an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is a medication used to reduce blood pressure and decrease cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria. Ezetimibe is used to lower cholesterol levels and is not indicated in this patient. Carvedilol is a beta-blocker used to treat heart failure, hypertension, and angina, but is not indicated for this patient. Aspirin is used for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with high cardiovascular risk, but in this case, treating hypertension with enalapril is a more appropriate initial step to reduce cardiovascular risk."
