The patient's laboratory results show high potassium levels in both serum and urine, indicating an extracellular potassium shift. The elevated glucose levels can cause an increased osmotic gradient, leading to the movement of potassium into the extracellular fluid. The patient's diabetes and recent noncompliance with medications may have contributed to this shift. Muscle cell breakdown (rhabdomyolysis) can also lead to increased potassium levels, but there is no evidence of this in the given scenario. Increased renal potassium absorption is not likely considering the patient's low blood pressure and decreased skin turgor. Repeated vomiting may lead to hypokalemia due to loss of potassium, rather than an increase in levels."

The patient has a high serum potassium level and the most likely cause is an extracellular shift, as seen in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
