The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest hyperthyroidism, and a non-tender enlarged thyroid gland is consistent with Graves\u2019 disease. In Graves\u2019 disease, the thyroid gland produces excess thyroid hormones, resulting in elevated T4, free T4, and T3 levels. However, the negative feedback loop in the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis causes a decrease in TSH levels. Therefore, the most expected thyroid function values are elevated T4, free T4, and T3 levels, and a decreased TSH level, which is option (B)."
