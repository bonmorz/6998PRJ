The patient is presenting with acute kidney injury, which could be due to hypovolemia from vomiting and decreased kidney perfusion from bilateral lower extremity edema. The most likely cause of acute kidney injury in this scenario is acute tubular necrosis (ATN). One of the classic findings of ATN is the presence of muddy brown casts on urine microscopy due to sloughed off tubular cells. Hyaline, waxy, and white blood cell casts are not typically seen with ATN."

Muddy brown casts are indicative of acute tubular necrosis, which can result from ischemia. Hyaline casts can be seen in normal and dehydrated individuals or in patients with mild renal impairment. Waxy casts are indicative of chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
