The fact that the patient admitted to feeling lonely at times suggests that smoking is a coping mechanism, and the patient may benefit from smoking cessation therapy. Varenicline is a medication commonly used for smoking cessation and has been shown to significantly improve long-term abstinence rates compared to placebo. The other interventions may help with the patient's shortness of breath, but smoking cessation would have the greatest impact on overall mortality."
