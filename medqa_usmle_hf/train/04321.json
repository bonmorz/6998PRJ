The question is asking for the process in myocytes responsible for the finding of significantly smaller calves after the patient's Petrie cast was removed. Among the options, only polyubiquitination of proteins is known to be involved in muscle atrophy, which can occur due to immobilization (such as in a Petrie cast). This process involves the tagging of proteins with ubiquitin molecules, which marks them for destruction by proteasomes. This can lead to a decrease in muscle mass, as seen in the patient's smaller calves."

The prolonged immobilization in a Petrie cast resulted in muscle atrophy, which is due to the process of polyubiquitination of proteins.

However, prolonged immobilization can also cause healthy proteins to be targeted for degradation, leading to muscle atrophy."

Polyubiquitination of proteins plays a role in the degradation of structural proteins that are no longer needed, and is therefore the most likely process responsible for the smaller calves. Decreased formation of double membrane bound vesicles refers to autophagy, which is not directly related to muscle atrophy from disuse. Increased formation of double membrane bound vesicles is not a known process. Monoubiquitination of proteins is involved in protein trafficking and DNA repair, but not muscle atrophy."
