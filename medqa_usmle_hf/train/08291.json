The stab wound is at the sternocostal junction at the 4th intercostal space, which is in close proximity to the right ventricle. The right ventricle is more susceptible to injury from penetrating trauma than the left ventricle due to its anterior location and thinner wall. Therefore, the most likely cardiovascular structure to be injured first in this stab wound is the right ventricle."
