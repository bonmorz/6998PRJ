Deletion 11-p-15 and duplication of 11-p-15 are not associated with Wilms tumor."

The combination of a non-tender upper abdominal mass, absent irises, and undescended testes is highly suggestive of WAGR (Wilms tumor, Aniridia, Genitourinary anomalies, and mental Retardation) syndrome. This syndrome is caused by a deletion of the 11p13 region, with the WT-1 and PAX6 genes involved. This deletion leads to the development of Wilms tumor, which is most likely the cause of the intra-renal mass seen on MRI. Deletion of 11-p-15 is not associated with any known genetic disorder. Duplication of 11-p-15 is rare, and its clinical significance is unknown."
