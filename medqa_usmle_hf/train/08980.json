The symptoms, including abdominal pain, constipation, reduced appetite, tiredness, and basophilic stippling in the peripheral blood smear suggest lead poisoning. In lead poisoning, lead inhibits ferrochelatase, which is necessary for heme synthesis, leading to basophilic stippling in peripheral blood cells. ALA synthase is inhibited in acute intermittent porphyria, while glutathione and uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase are not related to these symptoms."
