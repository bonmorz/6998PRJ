The X-ray shows multiple air-fluid levels in the abdomen, which is consistent with intestinal obstruction. The vomiting and difficulty latching to the breast suggest the possibility of trisomy 21 (also known as Down syndrome) which is associated with duodenal atresia. Duodenal atresia can lead to polyhydramnios in utero and obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract after birth. Trisomy 13 may present with midline defects including cleft lip and palate, but is not typically associated with duodenal atresia. 47 XXY and 45 XO are chromosomal anomalies that may not present with gastrointestinal symptoms in the newborn period."

The other options are associated with different genetic disorders and/or birth defects, but not specifically with duodenal atresia."
