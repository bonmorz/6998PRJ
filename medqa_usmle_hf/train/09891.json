The symptoms suggest uterine inversion, which is when the uterine fundus is pulled through and is turned inside out, leading to vaginal bleeding and shock. The brisk vaginal bleeding, along with a round mass protruding from the vagina, further suggest uterine inversion as the most likely cause. Uterine rupture would present with severe abdominal pain and a non-reassuring fetal heart rate. Retained placental products would not lead to brisk vaginal bleeding and shock. Laceration of the cervix would not cause a round mass protruding from the vagina."

The symptoms suggest that the most likely cause is uterine inversion, which can result from excessive traction on the umbilical cord during delivery. The protruding round mass is consistent with inverted uterus, and the brisk vaginal bleeding and inability to palpate the fundus on abdominal exam are also characteristic findings. Uterine rupture would result in a more acute and severe presentation with possible fetal distress. Retained placental products would present with postpartum hemorrhage, but not with the specific findings seen in this case. Laceration of cervix would also result in bleeding, but would not cause the protruding round mass seen in this patient."

The symptoms and postpartum bleeding suggest uterine inversion, which occurs when the uterus is turned inside out after delivery of the placenta. This is often associated with excessive traction on the umbilical cord or fundal pressure during attempts to deliver the placenta. Uterine rupture may occur during labor or delivery, but the prompt recognition of symptoms would not have permitted spontaneous delivery. Retained placental products can cause postpartum hemorrhage, however, the brisk vaginal bleeding with a round mass protruding from the vagina suggests uterine inversion. Laceration of the cervix may cause postpartum hemorrhage, but it is less likely to cause a brisk vaginal bleeding with a round mass protruding from the vagina as seen in this case."
