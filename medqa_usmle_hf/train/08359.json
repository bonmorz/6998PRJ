The midfacial hypoplasia with a flattened nasal bridge, smooth philtrum, and thin lips, along with developmental delay and a heart murmur, suggests fetal alcohol syndrome. Alcohol is a known teratogen that can cause such symptoms in a developing fetus. Lithium use during pregnancy can cause cardiac malformations, but it is not typically associated with midfacial hypoplasia. Tobacco can cause low birth weight and respiratory issues, but not usually midfacial hypoplasia. Cocaine exposure can cause cardiac defects, but typically not midfacial hypoplasia."
