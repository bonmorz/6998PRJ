In this scenario, the rapid rejection of the kidney transplant suggests a hyperacute rejection, where there is an immediate response by the recipient's immune system against the graft. Manifestations may include graft ischemia, necrosis and thrombosis, indicated by graft cyanosis, low urine output with evidence of blood, and histological evidence of vascular damage, but not arteriosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis is a chronic condition that may contribute to rejection over time, but not in this rapid timeframe."
