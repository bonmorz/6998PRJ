The symptoms described in the patient are suggestive of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), which is a neurological disorder that causes an irresistible urge to move one's legs. RLS has been associated with iron deficiency anemia, so the most likely abnormal laboratory study in this patient is a low hemoglobin or hematocrit level, which would suggest iron deficiency. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Complete blood count."
