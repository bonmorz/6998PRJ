Precocious puberty is present in the patient, but since the luteinizing hormone levels did not increase following GnRH agonist stimulation, the most likely cause is a granulosa cell tumor. Ovarian fibroma and hypothalamic glioma can cause precocious puberty but luteinizing hormone levels will increase following GnRH agonist stimulation. McCune-Albright syndrome is known for cafe-au-lait spots, not precocious puberty."

The bone age of 10 years also supports early puberty. However, the fact that serum luteinizing hormone levels do not increase following GnRH agonist stimulation eliminates central precocious puberty, such as hypothalamic glioma or McCune-Albright syndrome. Ovarian fibroma is unlikely to cause precocious puberty as it is a benign tumor. Granulosa cell tumors, on the other hand, can produce estrogen and cause precocious puberty in girls."

The bone age of 10 years and the absence of an increase in LH following GnRH agonist stimulation suggest central precocious puberty, which can be caused by a granulosa cell tumor in the ovary. Ovarian fibromas can cause estrogen secretion but not central precocious puberty. McCune-Albright syndrome is associated with precocious puberty but typically presents with skin pigmentation abnormalities and skeletal dysplasia. Hypothalamic gliomas can cause central precocious puberty but would be expected to increase LH levels following GnRH stimulation."

The elevated breast buds and presence of pubic and axillary hair suggest precocious puberty, and the bone age of 10 years indicates an accelerated rate of skeletal maturation. GnRH agonist stimulation should increase luteinizing hormone levels, but in this case, it did not. This points to a lack of activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which is typical of central precocious puberty. However, the presence of an ovarian tumor such as a Granulosa cell tumor can cause early onset of puberty, independent of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis activation."
