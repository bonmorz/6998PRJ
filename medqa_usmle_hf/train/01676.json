In most cases, a patient\u2019s spouse, partner, or next of kin is appointed as their health care surrogate and can make end-of-life decisions on their behalf, as in option (A). The patient\u2019s parents or adult children may also be considered, depending on state laws and the specific circumstances of the case. Option (B) is incorrect as the patient\u2019s husband is present and willing to act as her health care surrogate. Option (C) is unlikely as there is no mention of an adult daughter, and even if there were, she would not be automatically appointed as the health care surrogate without proper documentation or legal processes. Option (D) is also unlikely as it is generally not appropriate for a physician to be appointed as a patient\u2019s health care surrogate, as it could create conflicts of interest and compromise the physician\u2019s duty to provide unbiased medical care."
