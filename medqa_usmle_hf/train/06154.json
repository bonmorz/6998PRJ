The patient presents with shoulder pain that is worse when reaching overhead and is reproduced on active abduction of the right arm and passively internally rotating and then lifting the shoulder. This suggests rotator cuff tendinopathy, which can occur due to overuse or injury. Adhesive capsulitis can also cause shoulder pain and limited range of motion, but active and passive range of motion are full in this case. Biceps tendinopathy and glenohumeral osteoarthritis may also cause shoulder pain, but the specific movements that reproduce the pain and tenderness on palpation are not typically associated with these conditions."
