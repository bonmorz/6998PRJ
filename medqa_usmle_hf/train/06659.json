The patient\u2019s symptoms, including palpitations, pruritus, and edema, suggest hypereosinophilic syndrome, which is characterized by eosinophilia and can lead to restrictive cardiomyopathy. The laboratory studies also show a high percentage of eosinophils. Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), also known as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, is a possibility given the patient\u2019s history of taking ibuprofen, but it is less likely given the other symptoms. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, also known as Churg-Strauss syndrome, is a rare disorder that can cause eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, but the patient\u2019s symptoms do not fit this diagnosis. Strongyloidiasis eosinophilia is a parasitic infection that can cause eosinophilia, but the patient\u2019s history and symptoms do not suggest this diagnosis."

The patient presents with palpitations, swelling of legs, pruritus, dyspnea on exertion, and papules and linear scratch marks on the limbs and trunk, all of which can be symptoms of hypereosinophilic syndrome. The high eosinophil count and thickening of the mitral valve also suggest this diagnosis. Option A (DRESS) is usually associated with a more diffuse rash, and option B (EGPA) typically involves the upper respiratory tract and kidneys. Option D (Strongyloidiasis eosinophilia) can cause eosinophilia, but is usually associated with gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms, and does not explain the cardiac and splenic findings."

Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and Strongyloidiasis eosinophilia do not account for all of the patient\u2019s symptoms and findings. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis may present with eosinophilia, but usually involves the respiratory tract, skin, and kidneys rather than the heart and liver."

The patient\u2019s presentation with palpitations, pruritus, dyspnea, papules and scratch marks, and peripheral edema suggests Hypereosinophilic syndrome, which is characterized by hypereosinophilia and organ damage due to eosinophilic infiltration. The echocardiography findings of restrictive-pattern cardiomyopathy and thickening of the mitral valve are consistent with Hypereosinophilic syndrome, as is the peripheral blood eosinophilia. The presence of a thrombus in the left ventricular apex is a complication of the disease, as is ascites due to hepatic congestion. DRESS is unlikely since the patient has no recent history of drug exposure. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome) typically presents with asthma, allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis, which are not present in this patient. Strongyloidiasis eosinophilia is a parasitic infection and not consistent with the patient\u2019s history or laboratory findings."
