The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest that she has developed photodermatitis, an inflammation of the skin caused by exposure to sunlight. The most likely underlying mechanism is apoptosis of keratinocytes in the epidermis, as UV radiation can cause DNA damage and activate apoptosis pathways in skin cells. Immune complex deposits, mast cell activation, and T-cell-mediated inflammatory reactions are not typically involved in photodermatitis."

The symptoms of the patient\u2019s case indicate sunburn, which involves damage to the skin cells due to overexposure to UV radiation. This leads to apoptosis or programmed cell death of keratinocytes in the epidermis, resulting in erythema, scaling, and pain. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). Option (A) is a mechanism seen in autoimmune skin diseases, (B) is seen in urticaria or hives, and (D) is seen in conditions such as psoriasis or eczema."
