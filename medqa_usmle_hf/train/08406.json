The symptoms suggest ototoxicity, which can be caused by certain antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides, which inhibit the formation of the translation initiation complex. This can lead to damage to the hair cells in the inner ear, causing hearing loss, vertigo, and ataxia. The other options refer to mechanisms of action of different classes of antibiotics that are not typically associated with ototoxicity."

Option B refers to antibiotics that inhibit bacterial RNA polymerase, while option C refers to antibiotics that inhibit DNA gyrase, neither of which are associated with ototoxicity. Option D refers to drugs that generate free radicals, which can damage DNA and cause other types of cellular damage, but do not typically cause ototoxicity."

This is because many ototoxic drugs specifically target the hair cells in the ear that rely on protein synthesis for their function, and disruption of the translation initiation complex can disrupt this process."
