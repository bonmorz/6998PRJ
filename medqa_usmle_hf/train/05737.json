The presentation suggests Intellectual disability as the most likely diagnosis, with delayed fine motor milestones and lower-than-average IQ. The child\u2019s social conversation and engagement with classmates suggest that Autism and ADHD are less likely. OCD does not typically present with delayed fine motor skills or lower IQ."
