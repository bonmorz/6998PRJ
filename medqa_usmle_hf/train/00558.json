The symptoms of dyspnea, confusion, and purpura on the anterior chest, head, and neck are classic signs of FES. The chest X-ray may show diffuse alveolar infiltrates, which is consistent with FES, and the arterial blood gas analysis shows respiratory alkalosis, which is also common in FES. Hospital-acquired pneumonia and pulmonary thromboembolism do not typically present in this manner. Acute respiratory distress syndrome may occur as a complication of FES, but it does not explain the patient's presenting symptoms."
