Darunavir and ritonavir are antiretroviral medications that target the protease enzyme in HIV, which is responsible for cleaving HIV polyproteins into functional proteins. Therefore, reduced viral susceptibility to these medications suggests a mutation in the protease gene, specifically affecting the process of protein modification. Option A pertains to the integration of viral DNA into the host genome, which is not affected by protease inhibitors. Option B refers to protein synthesis, which is not related to protease activity. Option D pertains to T-cell receptor binding, which is not directly related to HIV replication or drug resistance."

The mutation affecting susceptibility to darunavir and ritonavir suggests that the patient has developed resistance to protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors target the HIV protease enzyme, which is responsible for cleaving HIV precursor proteins into active viral proteins. The mutation may affect the ability of the protease inhibitor to bind to the active site of the protease enzyme, thereby reducing its effectiveness in preventing viral protein maturation. This process involves the modification of translated proteins."

The question is asking about the molecular process affected by the mutation causing reduced viral susceptibility to darunavir and ritonavir. These medications are protease inhibitors, which means they interfere with the post-translational modification of HIV proteins necessary for viral maturation. Therefore, the mutation is most likely affecting the process of modification of translated proteins. Integration of DNA into the host genome is not directly related to these medications, nor is the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes or the binding of glycoproteins to T-cell receptors."
