The lung inflation curve shows reduced lung capacity and volume, indicating pulmonary fibrosis, which is often caused by occupational exposure to pollutants such as those in the construction industry. The absence of other symptoms and past medical history suggest this is the most likely cause. Normal aging does not typically cause such severe lung function decline. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and asthma are also possible causes, but they typically present with other symptoms and the lung function curve would show different patterns."

The patient has a history of working in the construction industry, applying insulation to roofs for over 20 years, which suggests possible exposure to asbestos. The X and Y axes of the lung inflation curve represent volume and pressure, respectively. The downward curve represents a reduction in lung compliance, which is common in pulmonary fibrosis.
