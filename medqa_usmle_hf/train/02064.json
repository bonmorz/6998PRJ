The symptoms of tinnitus and progressive hearing loss in one ear, along with the results of the Weber test (lateralization to the affected ear) and Rinne test (air conduction greater than bone conduction) suggest the most likely diagnosis is acoustic neuroma. Other options such as presbycusis and cerumen impaction typically do not present with unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, and M\u00e9ni\u00e8re disease typically presents with vertigo in addition to hearing loss and tinnitus."

The Weber test, in which the vibration tuning fork is placed on the forehead, shows lateralization to the contralateral ear in cases of unilateral conductive hearing loss or ipsilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The Rinne test, in which the tuning fork is held first on the mastoid bone and then in front of the ear canal, allows to distinguish sensorineural from conductive hearing loss. In this case, the Rinne test shows sensorineural hearing loss in both ears."
