The colonoscopy image shows an angiodysplasia, a type of vascular malformation that can cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Diverticulitis can cause inflammation and infection of diverticula, but not usually bleeding. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a genetic disorder that causes abnormal blood vessel development and can cause bleeding, but it is not likely given the patient's age and lack of other relevant symptoms. Intestinal obstruction cannot explain the anemia and positive occult blood test."
