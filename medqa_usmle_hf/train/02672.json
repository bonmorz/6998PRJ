Curettage with suctioning and tranexamic acid are not appropriate first-line management for postpartum hemorrhage with uterine atony."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest postpartum hemorrhage, and the enlarged, soft uterus indicates uterine atony, which is the most common cause. The first priority is to perform bimanual uterine massage to help the uterus contract and reduce bleeding. Methylergometrine can also help with uterine contraction, but since the diagnosis is not confirmed, it should not be administered yet. Curettage with suctioning may be needed if the bleeding does not stop with massage or medication, but it is not the first-line treatment. Tranexamic acid can help stop bleeding, but it takes time to work and is not the first-line treatment in this emergency situation."
