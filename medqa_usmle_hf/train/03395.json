Pseudohypercalcemia is a condition in which serum calcium levels are elevated due to factors other than increased ionized calcium concentration, such as increased serum protein-bound calcium or decreased serum albumin but the albumin level is within normal limits in this case."

Pseudohypercalcemia is caused by high levels of proteins and calcium bound to them, but the patient\u2019s protein levels are not high enough to explain the high calcium."

Immobilization can cause hypercalcemia, which is confirmed by the high calcium and phosphorus levels in the lab results. Sarcoidosis can cause hypercalcemia, but there is no evidence of granulomas or tissue infiltration on examination. Pseudohypercalcemia is an erroneous measurement of calcium that occurs when calcium is bound to a protein, which is not the case here. Paraneoplastic syndrome can also cause hypercalcemia but there is no evidence of malignancy in the patient."
