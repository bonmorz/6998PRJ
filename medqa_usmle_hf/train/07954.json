Serum FSH and LH levels can be helpful in evaluating for other causes of primary amenorrhea, such as ovarian failure or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, but they are not specific for Turner syndrome. Serum testosterone level and serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone level would be more useful in evaluating for androgen excess or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, respectively, which are not suggested by the patient's presentation."
