A renal ultrasound or imaging is not urgent but may be done later to evaluate any sequelae of pyelonephritis. Outpatient treatment with oral ciprofloxacin is not recommended because the patient has a high fever and symptoms of pyelonephritis, which usually require intravenous antibiotics.

The patient\u2019s symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a urinary tract infection, which can lead to pyelonephritis in pregnant women. Inpatient treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone is the most appropriate option as it covers both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms commonly associated with pyelonephritis, and the patient should be monitored closely in the hospital setting. A renal ultrasound may be helpful in further evaluating the urinary tract, but it is not the most important next step in management. Outpatient treatment with oral ciprofloxacin or inpatient treatment with intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin may not provide adequate coverage for the likely causative organisms."

However, the presence of costovertebral angle tenderness on the right suggests pyelonephritis. Blood and urine samples have been obtained for culture and sensitivity, which means that the infection is severe and requires intravenous antibiotics. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is inpatient treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone. Option A, renal ultrasound, may be performed to evaluate the severity and extent of infection, but it is not necessary at this point. Outpatient treatment with oral ciprofloxacin is not recommended in pregnant patients due to potential adverse effects on the fetus. Inpatient treatment with intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin may be considered if the patient is allergic to ceftriaxone or if the organism is resistant to ceftriaxone."
