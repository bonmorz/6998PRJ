The symptoms, including recurrent right lower quadrant abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and positive fecal occult blood test, suggest inflammatory bowel syndrome. Family history of cancer may increase the risk but is not indicative of the present diagnosis. Appendicitis has more localized pain and a positive rebound tenderness sign. Colon cancer usually affects people over 50 years old and has no correlation with anxiety or depression. Infectious colitis may have similar symptoms but the recurrent pain and fecal occult blood test result suggest a more chronic condition."

Colon cancer is less likely given the patient\u2019s age and lack of significant findings on physical exam. Infectious colitis can present with similar symptoms, but the positive fecal occult blood test suggests a more chronic process like IBS."
