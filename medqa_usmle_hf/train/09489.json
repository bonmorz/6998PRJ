The patient\u2019s symptoms and risk factors (uncontrolled diabetes and hypercholesterolemia) suggest acute coronary syndrome. The chest pain is severe and radiating, and the ST-segment elevation on ECG is a strong indicator of myocardial infarction. The fact that sublingual nitroglycerin lessened the pain also supports this diagnosis. GERD and diffuse esophageal spasm can cause chest pain, but they would not present with ST-segment elevation on ECG. Pulmonary embolism can also cause chest pain, but it is usually associated with shortness of breath, which the patient denies."
