The clinical presentation of a bulging tympanic membrane with green discharge suggests acute otitis media, and the gram-negative coccobacillus that grows on chocolate agar is most likely Haemophilus influenzae. This pathogen produces a virulence factor called IgA protease, which cleaves secretory immunoglobulins and allows the bacteria to evade the host's immune system. Option A is related to bacterial opsonization, option B to the activity of pertussis toxin, and option D to the activity of diphtheria toxin, which are not relevant for this case."
