The patient's history and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is characterized by airflow limitation caused by inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, and destruction of lung tissue. Neutrophilic inflammation is a major component of COPD pathology, making it the most likely type of cell responsible for this patient's pulmonary condition. Th2 cells are involved in allergic and asthmatic inflammation, while type II alveolar cells and mast cells play important roles in lung surfactant production and host defense, respectively."
