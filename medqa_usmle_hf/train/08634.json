The drug mentioned in the question is likely insulin, which increases glucose transport to skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Insulin also inhibits the enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, which catalyzes the reverse of the rate-limiting step in glycolysis, leading to dephosphorylation of the enzyme. Therefore, the correct answer is (A). Upregulation of glucose transporter type 3 expression, cleavage of UDP from UDP-glucose, and phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase kinase are not directly related to the action of insulin."

The drug mentioned increases glucose transport to skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, which implies an insulin-like effect. Insulin activates protein kinase B (PKB), which in turn leads to the dephosphorylation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, thereby leading to increased glycolysis and glucose utilization. Option B is incorrect as glucose transporter type 4 (not 3) is upregulated by insulin. Option C is incorrect as UDP glucose pyrophosphorylase, not UDP, cleaves UDP from UDP-glucose during glycogen synthesis. Option D is incorrect as phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase kinase increases glycogen breakdown."

The drug in question is likely insulin, which increases glucose transport to skeletal muscle and adipose tissue by stimulating the insertion of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) into the plasma membrane. This leads to a decrease in blood glucose levels and an increase in cellular uptake of glucose. Dephosphorylation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase occurs in response to insulin, which stimulates glycogen synthesis and decreases gluconeogenesis. Upregulation of glucose transporter type 3 expression is not a cellular event that occurs in response to insulin; this transporter is primarily expressed in the brain and serves as a backup to GLUT4 in tissues that do not rely on insulin for glucose uptake. Cleavage of UDP from UDP-glucose is a step in glycogen synthesis, but it is not directly affected by insulin. Phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase kinase is a step in glycogenolysis and is stimulated by glucagon and epinephrine, not insulin."
