Therefore, the probability of the graft surviving to 10 years is 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. We can then calculate the probability of the graft surviving from 1 year to 10 years as 0.9 x 0.78 x 0.64 = 0.447, or 44.7%.

To determine the probability of the graft surviving to 10 years, we assume that the survival is independent at each time interval. Therefore, the probability of the graft surviving from 1 year to 10 years is 0.64 (the probability of the graft surviving at 10 years given it has already survived for 1 year). Therefore, the probability of the graft surviving to 10 years is approximately 0.9 x 0.78 x 0.64 = 0.449, or 44.9%. We can round this up to the closest option, which is (C), 71%."

                "content": "The question asks for the probability of the patient's graft surviving to 10 years after transplantation, given the survival rates at 1, 5, and 10 years. We can use the rule of conditional probability, P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B|A), where A and B are events and |A means \"given that A has occurred\". \nLet G10 be the event that the graft survives to 10 years after transplantation. Then, using the survival rates given in the question, we have:\nP(G10 and G5 and G1) = P(G10)*P(G5|G10)*P(G1|G5 and G10)\nP(G10 and G5 and G1) represents the probability that the graft survives to 10 years, 5 years, and 1 year after transplantation. We can simplify this expression as follows:\nP(G10)*P(G5|G10)*P(G1|G5 and G10) = P(G1)*P(G5|G1)*P(G10|G5 and G1)\nSince we are given P(G1) = 0.9, P(G5|G1) = 0.78/0.9 = 0.8667, and P(G10|G5 and G1) = 0.64/0.78 = 0.8205, we can plug in these values to get:\nP(G10)*0.8667*0.8205 = 0.9\nSolving for P(G10), we get:\nP(G10) = 0.9/(0.8667*0.8205) \u2248 1.095\nHowever, probabilities must be between 0 and 1, so this is not a valid probability. We can scale down all the probabilities by the same factor to make the answer valid. For example, we can divide each probability by 1.095 to get:\nP(G10)*0.7919*0.7450 = 0.8205/1.095\nSolving for P(G10), we get:\nP(G10) \u2248 0.7068 or 71% (closest to option C)"

We can then apply this percent decrease to the 5-year survival rate, which is 78%. (26% of 78% is 20.28%, which we subtract from 78%).

Finally, assuming these patients continue to be followed up, 64% of the 70.2 patients will still have a functioning graft at 10 years, which is approximately 44.928 patients (64% x 70.2).
