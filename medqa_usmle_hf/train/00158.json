The patient\u2019s history of long-distance flight suggests the possibility of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can cause swelling and pain in the leg. The increased homocysteine concentration suggests a deficiency in folate or cobalamin, but the fact that only the folate concentration is listed as an option suggests that this is the correct answer. Fibrinogen is a protein that helps clotting, but it is not necessarily linked to DVT. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is not directly related to these symptoms."
