The presentation of blood in stool and oozing blood from the umbilical site which has not fully healed suggest vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K is needed for blood clotting, and newborns are usually given an injection of vitamin K at birth to prevent this deficiency. Bacterial infection can be a possible cause but the umbilical site and positive guaiac stool test suggest otherwise. Factor IX deficiency and Vitamin B12 deficiency are unlikely causes."

The fact that the baby was born by home birth and did not receive vitamin K prophylaxis further supports this diagnosis."

Vitamin K is necessary for blood clotting and newborns are at risk for deficiency due to limited transfer from the mother and low levels in breast milk. Lack of adequate clotting factors can result in bleeding, as seen in the umbilical site and stool test. Bacterial infection and factor IX deficiency are less likely given the absence of other symptoms and family history. Vitamin B12 deficiency is also unlikely given the patient\u2019s age and lack of other symptoms."

Bacterial infection usually presents with fever and other signs of infection. Factor IX deficiency and Vitamin B12 deficiency are both rare in newborns and do not present with these symptoms."
