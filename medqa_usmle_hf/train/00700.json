The presence of coarse hair growth, oily skin, acne, and deepening of the voice suggests virilization, and the firm, enlarged ovary indicates an ovarian tumour. Among the options, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour is most commonly associated with virilization. Thecoma and Granulosa cell tumours may also cause virilization, but they are usually associated with estrogen production, leading to abnormal uterine bleeding. Adrenocortical carcinoma may also cause virilization, but it usually presents with other symptoms like abdominal pain, weight loss, and hypertension."

The patient presents with physical changes including unwanted hair growth, oily skin, and acne, as well as changes in external genitalia such as a deepening voice, weight gain, and an enlarged clitoris. These symptoms suggest an androgen-secreting tumor, and among the options, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor is associated with the symptoms described. Thecoma is typically associated with excess estrogen secretion, adrenocortical carcinoma presents with Cushing's syndrome, and granulosa cell tumors are typically associated with irregular periods or postmenopausal bleeding."
