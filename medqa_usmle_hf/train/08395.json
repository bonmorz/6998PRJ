Verapamil is chosen over nifedipine because it slows atrioventricular conduction more effectively than nifedipine. Verapamil also has negative inotropic effects, which can be beneficial in treating atrial fibrillation. Nifedipine is not typically used to treat atrial fibrillation, but rather to treat hypertension. Verapamil and nifedipine both bind to the \u03b11 subunit of the L-type calcium channel, but verapamil also binds to the \u03b12 subunit, which gives it additional effects on atrioventricular conduction."

Verapamil is a calcium channel blocking agent that primarily targets the L-type calcium channels found in cardiac and smooth muscle cells. It is more effective than nifedipine in slowing atrioventricular conduction and controlling ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation. Option B is incorrect because verapamil has negative inotropic effects, which can cause hypotension or heart failure. Option C is incorrect because verapamil is not typically used for blood pressure control. Option D is incorrect because both verapamil and nifedipine bind to the \u03b11 subunit of the L-type calcium channel, but verapamil also binds to the \u03b12 subunit."
