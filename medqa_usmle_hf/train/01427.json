The chest X-ray also shows diffuse bilateral lung infiltrates, which is consistent with tuberculosis. The negative tuberculin skin test does not rule out tuberculosis, as some patients with active tuberculosis may not react to the test. The presence of hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and ophthalmologic lesions are also consistent with tuberculosis. Chronic histoplasmosis is primarily seen in immunocompromised individuals, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis is mostly seen in children. Bronchoalveolar carcinoma does not typically present with the symptoms and findings seen in this patient."

The patient has symptoms of fever, cough, weight loss, and generalized lymphadenopathy, with auscultation findings of diffuse crackles throughout the lung fields bilaterally, suggesting tuberculosis. The chest X-ray also shows typical findings of pulmonary tuberculosis. The negative tuberculin skin test could be indicative of anergy, a condition where a person's immune system is unable to mount a response to an antigen. The yellow lesions on the posterior pole of the eye could be indicative of choroidal tubercles, a finding commonly seen in patients with tuberculosis."
