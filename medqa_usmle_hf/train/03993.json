The patient's symptoms are consistent with multiple sclerosis, specifically optic neuritis causing vision loss and spasticity and hyperreflexia in the lower extremities. A FLAIR MRI may show demyelinating lesions in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord, which is consistent with multiple sclerosis. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis typically presents with acute encephalopathy and focal neurologic deficits, while CADASIL typically presents with recurrent subcortical strokes in young adults. Lead intoxication may cause a range of neurologic symptoms, but the presentation and MRI findings are not consistent with this diagnosis."
