Creatinine is a marker of renal function, and a level above 2.0 is considered significant renal dysfunction. Therefore, a creatinine level above 2.0 would be a contraindication to the use of metformin. Option (A) and (B) are within normal ranges, and option (C) is a high glucose level commonly seen in diabetes mellitus."
