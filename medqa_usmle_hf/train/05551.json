Somatostatin is a hormone that regulates the secretion of other hormones, including insulin and glucagon. It is also used to treat gallstones by inhibiting the release of gallbladder-contracting substances such as cholecystokinin. Therefore, it is most likely that somatostatin levels will be increased in this patient with gallstones."
