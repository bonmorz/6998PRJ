The laboratory findings show no evidence of hemolysis or elevated liver enzymes, which are necessary for HELLP syndrome diagnosis. Eclampsia is a complication that occurs when preeclampsia progresses and causes seizures, which this patient has not yet experienced. Gestational hypertension is a condition where hypertension develops after 20 weeks gestation but does not present with proteinuria, which this patient has. Immediate management should include antihypertensive medication and close monitoring of both mother and fetus."
