The fracture through the sphenoid bone and blood in the sphenoid sinus suggest involvement of the cranial nerves, specifically cranial nerve VI. This nerve controls the lateral rectus muscle of the eye, which pulls the eye laterally. Damage to this nerve can cause inward deviation of the eye. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. Left facial paralysis would result if cranial nerve VII was affected, decreased hearing in the left ear would result if cranial nerve VIII was affected, and deviation of the uvula to the right would result if cranial nerve X was affected, but there is no indication of involvement of these nerves from the given information."

The fracture is through the sphenoid bone and the swelling/bruising is around the left temple and eye, both of which are associated with the lateral rectus muscle. Therefore, an inward deviation of the left eye (medial strabismus) is the most likely neurological finding. Left facial paralysis and decreased hearing in the left ear are not associated with the sphenoid bone fracture. Deviation of the uvula to the right is a sign of a lesion in the glossopharyngeal nerve, which is not related to the sphenoid bone."
