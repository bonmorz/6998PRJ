Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist that works by inhibiting dopamine receptors in the area postrema, a region in the brain that plays a role in vomiting. This leads to an anti-emetic effect and relief from nausea and vomiting. Option A is incorrect as metoclopramide works by enhancing gastric emptying rather than small intestinal and colonic motility. Option C is also incorrect as metoclopramide does not affect esophageal peristaltic amplitude. Option D is incorrect as motilin receptors are not targeted by metoclopramide."

Metoclopramide works as a dopamine antagonist, and specifically inhibits dopamine receptors in the area postrema, which in turn reduces nausea and vomiting.
