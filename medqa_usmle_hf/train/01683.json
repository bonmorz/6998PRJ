The patient\u2019s symptoms, including patchy red, scaly skin on both hands and the need to continuously wash her hands, indicate obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Symptoms of OCD are ego-dystonic, meaning the person is aware that their thoughts and behaviors are irrational or excessive. While OCD can be treated, it often requires long-term therapy and management. The condition is not associated with early onset dementia and can significantly affect daily functioning."
