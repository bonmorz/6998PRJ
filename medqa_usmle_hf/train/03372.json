The patient has metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation indicated by the low HCO3- level and respiratory rate. The next best step would be to administer bicarbonate and repeat lab studies to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment. High dose bicarbonate is not necessary and can cause metabolic alkalosis. Hydrochlorothiazide is used to treat hypertension but would not address the metabolic acidosis. Obtaining urine sodium level would not be helpful in this case."

The patient has metabolic acidosis due to low HCO3- levels, which may be caused by lactulose use or metabolic derangement in the context of obesity or diabetes. Choice (A) is correct because bicarbonate administration and repeat lab studies can help determine the underlying cause of the metabolic acidosis. Choice (B) is incorrect because high-dose bicarbonate can lead to severe metabolic alkalosis. Choice (C) is incorrect because hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and not indicated for the current presentation. Choice (D) is incorrect because urine sodium levels are not helpful in this scenario."
