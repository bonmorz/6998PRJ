Treatment with corticosteroids should therefore be continued. However, since her ITP has been managed with systemic corticosteroid therapy, other treatment options should be explored. Splenectomy is a common treatment for ITP and may help to improve her symptoms. Intravenous immunoglobulin and transfusion of thrombocytes may provide temporary relief, but they will not address the underlying cause of her symptoms."

Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin or transfusion of thrombocytes will not address the underlying cause of the symptoms. The patient\u2019s past medical history of ITP and the current presentation of petechiae and bruises suggest that splenectomy may be the best course of treatment, as it has been shown to be effective in reducing bleeding episodes in patients with ITP."
