The symptoms and the presence of morulae in the granulocytes suggest that the patient is infected with Ehrlichiosis, which can be treated with the drug of choice doxycycline. Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S subunit of the ribosome and preventing the binding of tRNA, leading to bacteriostatic effects. Option A and B refer to targets of other antibiotics, while option C refers to the target of penicillin, which is ineffective against Ehrlichiosis."

The drug of choice for this condition is doxycycline, which binds to the bacterial ribosome and inhibits the binding of tRNA, therefore preventing elongation of the growing peptide chain. This bacteriostatic effect is the reason why doxycycline is effective against many gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Options A, B, and C are mechanisms of action for other antibiotics."

The symptoms, leukopenia, and mulberry-like inclusions in the granulocytes suggest an infection with Ehrlichia bacteria. The drug of choice for this infection is doxycycline, which inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the acceptor site of ribosomes, therefore the correct answer is (D). Option (A) is incorrect as it refers to transcription of bacterial DNA, and doxycycline does not affect DNA replication. Option (B) is incorrect as it refers to the activity of bacterial topoisomerases, which doxycycline does not inhibit. Option (C) is incorrect as it refers to peptidoglycan crosslinking and cell wall synthesis, which is not affected by doxycycline but by beta-lactam antibiotics."

Doxycycline works by binding to the bacterial tRNA, preventing the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the acceptor site of ribosomes, thus inhibiting protein synthesis. Therefore, the correct answer is (D). Option (A) is incorrect because doxycycline does not inhibit transcription. Option (B) is incorrect because doxycycline does not inhibit topoisomerase II or IV.
