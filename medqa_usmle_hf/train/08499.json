Option (A) is incorrect because caffeine consumption is not an established risk factor for pancreatic cancer.

Option (C) is incorrect because diabetes is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, but patients with pancreatic cancer do not necessarily rapidly develop glucose intolerance or severe diabetes."
