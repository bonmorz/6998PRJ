The patient\u2019s presentation is consistent with acute rheumatic fever, which can cause nodules, a characteristic murmur, and fever. An endomysial biopsy may show fibrinoid necrosis with histiocytic infiltrate, which is a finding commonly seen in rheumatic carditis. Coagulative necrosis with neutrophilic infiltrate suggests acute inflammation, which is not typical in acute rheumatic fever. Deposits of misfolded protein aggregates and myocardial infiltration with eosinophilic proteins are not commonly associated with acute rheumatic fever."
