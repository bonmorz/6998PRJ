The study found that eplerenone, when added to optimal medical therapy, decreased all-cause mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction. The study also reported a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes, as well as a higher incidence of hyperkalemia and a lower incidence of hypokalemia in the eplerenone group compared to the placebo group. Therefore, the most accurate interpretation of the results is that eplerenone can be effective in reducing mortality and morbidity in this patient population. Option A is incorrect because there was a significant difference in the incidence of hyperkalemia between the trial arms. Option B is incorrect because the study reported a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes. Option D is incorrect because the study found that the most common causes of death were attributed to cardiovascular causes."
