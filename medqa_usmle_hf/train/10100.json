Neutrophils are primarily responsible for phagocytosis and destruction of bacteria through the formation of phagolysosomes. Therefore, the organism causing the condition is destroyed by phagolysosome formation by neutrophils. Option A refers to the destruction of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells, option B refers to the activation of programmed cell death by caspases, and option C refers to the destruction of infected cells by natural killer cells. These processes are not specific to bacterial infections."

The elevated WBC count, neutrophil predominance, and increased ESR/CRP suggest a bacterial infection, likely bacterial sinusitis or cellulitis. Neutrophils play a key role in destroying bacterial pathogens through phagocytosis and phagolysosome formation. Therefore, the correct answer is option (D). Option (A) involves cytotoxic T cells that target infected cells, not bacteria. Option (B) refers to the activation of caspases during apoptosis, not bacterial killing. Option (C) refers to the function of natural killer cells against viruses and tumor cells, not bacteria."

Neutrophils are the primary phagocytic cells that engulf and destroy bacteria by forming phagolysosomes.

Option A is incorrect since cytotoxic T cells are involved in cell-mediated immune responses and do not directly destroy bacteria. Option B is incorrect since cytosolic caspases are involved in apoptosis, not bacterial destruction. Option C is incorrect since natural killer cells are involved in killing virus-infected cells and cancer cells, not bacteria."
