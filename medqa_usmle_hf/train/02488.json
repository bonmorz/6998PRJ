The patient describes symptoms of chest pain, sensation of something being stuck in her chest, difficulty swallowing, and a family history of scleroderma. These symptoms suggest the most likely diagnosis is esophageal motility disorder, and the most appropriate confirmatory test is esophageal manometry, which evaluates the function of the esophageal muscles and can diagnose motility disorders. The other options, including endoscopy, EKG, and troponin I, are not relevant to this specific condition."
