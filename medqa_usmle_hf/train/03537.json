The CT scan shows a \"whirl sign\", indicating a possible volvulus of the sigmoid colon. The presence of green bilious fluid on the nasogastric tube and the lactic acidosis suggest an ischemic bowel, and the patient is deteriorating despite IV fluids. Therefore, immediate laparotomy and surgical management would be the most appropriate next step in management to address the underlying volvulus and ischemic bowel. Option A, therapy with antibiotics, may be appropriate after surgery but is not the primary management. Pneumatic enema (option C) and sigmoidoscopy with attempted derotation and rectal tube placement (option D) are also not appropriate first-line management in a patient with suspected ischemic bowel."

Immediate laparotomy and surgical management is the best next step in management.
