It is considered an obstetric emergency, and the immediate management includes administration of intravenous fluids to maintain adequate blood volume and perfusion to the placenta and fetus. The other options are not appropriate initial management steps for this condition. Vaginal delivery might be necessary depending on the severity of the condition and the gestational age of the fetus. Betamethasone is used for fetal lung maturation in cases of premature delivery. Tranexamic acid is used to treat excessive bleeding, which may occur due to placental abruption."
