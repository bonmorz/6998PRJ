The correct next step is to inform the patient that a mistake was made and explain why it happened, as accurate communication is essential for building and maintaining trust with patients. A patient has the right to know what is happening with their own healthcare, even if no harm was done in this particular case. It is important to acknowledge the mistake and take steps to prevent similar errors in the future. Not telling the patient or withholding information out of fear of malpractice litigation is not ethically justified."

It is also the ethical and legal obligation of healthcare providers to disclose errors to patients. Not telling the patient about the mistake because she is likely to sue for malpractice or because someone else made the mistake are not appropriate responses."

Option (D) is incorrect as the attending physician is responsible for the overall care provided by the healthcare team, even if they did not directly make the mistake."

In this case, a mistake was made by the nurse in administering a higher dose of warfarin than ordered, which led to an adverse event (increased INR and bleeding). The correct next step is to inform the patient about the mistake, explain why it happened, and apologize for any resulting harm. This helps to maintain trust and open communication between the patient and healthcare team, and also allows for appropriate follow-up and monitoring of the patient's condition. Option B, C, and D are not appropriate responses as they do not prioritize patient safety, informed consent, or ethical and professional responsibility."
