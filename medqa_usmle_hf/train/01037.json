Since the patient\u2019s testosterone levels are normal, we must look for other causes. Obesity is a known cause of hirsutism and the patient is obese, so weight loss can help. An oral contraceptive can also help by reducing androgen levels in the body. Among the options, only oral contraceptives are used to treat hirsutism. Prednisone and Leuprolide are not used to treat hirsutism, and ketoconazole can have potential liver toxicity."
