The presence of fatigue and shortness of breath along with diminished breath sounds at the right lung base on physical examination and blunting of the right costophrenic angle on an x-ray of the chest suggests the presence of pleural effusion. Additionally, the protein concentration of the fluid obtained through thoracentesis is important in identifying the underlying cause. A protein concentration of 1.9 g/dL is consistent with a transudative pleural effusion, which is most frequently due to congestive heart failure. The other options are less likely to cause a transudative pleural effusion."

Pulmonary sarcoidosis can sometimes cause pleural effusion, but the low protein in the fluid make CHF more likely in this case."
