Administration of a loop diuretic would not be helpful in this case as it does not address the underlying cause of the obstruction.

The patient presents with severe abdominal and flank pain, inability to urinate, and bilateral flank tenderness, and the lab results show elevated BUN and creatinine, indicating acute renal failure. Renal ultrasonography shows dilation of the kidneys bilaterally with a normal-sized bladder, indicating bilateral obstruction. The most likely cause of obstruction is compression of the ureters by enlarged lymph nodes due to his lymphoma. Therefore, bilateral stenting of the ureters would be most beneficial in treating this patient's condition by relieving the obstruction and restoring urine flow. Administration of a loop diuretic would not be effective because the obstruction is not due to fluid overload. Bilateral stenting of the renal arteries would not be appropriate in this case because the kidneys are not compromised by poor blood flow. Catheterization of the bladder would not be effective in relieving the obstruction in the ureters."
