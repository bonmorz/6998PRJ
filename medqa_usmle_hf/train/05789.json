The symptoms described match those of a condition called Tetralogy of Fallot, which includes a ventricular septal defect, pulmonary valve stenosis, a misplaced aorta, and a thickened right ventricular wall.

However, seizures can be associated with Tetralogy of Fallot and can be caused by hypoxia due to decreased blood flow in the pulmonary arteries. Therefore, seizures are the most likely symptom to occur."
