In patients with suspected traumatic diaphragmatic rupture, a chest CT scan with contrast is the most appropriate next step in management. This can help confirm the diagnosis, evaluate the extent of the injury, and identify potentially associated injuries. Barium studies are no longer recommended as they carry a risk of barium peritonitis in case of a perforation. Chest fluoroscopy and MRI are not as sensitive or specific as CT for evaluating traumatic diaphragmatic rupture."
