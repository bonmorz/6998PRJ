The most likely cause for the patient's symptoms is erectile dysfunction, and the absence of nocturnal erections suggests a physical cause rather than a psychiatric cause. Checking prolactin levels can help determine if there is an underlying endocrine disorder causing the erectile dysfunction. Starting sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, can also help treat erectile dysfunction, but checking prolactin levels should be done first to rule out other possible causes. Stopping isosorbide dinitrate is not likely to improve erectile dysfunction and may even worsen the patient's angina symptoms. Referring to a psychiatrist is not necessary at this time, as there is no evidence of a psychiatric cause for the patient's erectile dysfunction."
