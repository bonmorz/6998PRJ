The researcher wants to investigate the effect of smoking electronic cigarettes on the risk of developing lung cancer, and thus the most appropriate experimental group is subjects who smoke electronic cigarettes. The control group should consist of subjects who do not smoke, as they will provide a baseline for comparison to determine the effect of smoking electronic cigarettes on the risk of developing lung cancer. Option B compares two smoking groups but does not provide a non-smoking group for comparison. Option C compares subjects with existing lung cancer to those without, which may not accurately measure the risk of developing lung cancer from smoking electronic cigarettes.

Option B is not appropriate as it compares two types of smoking, while the researcher is interested in the effect of electronic cigarette use specifically. Option C is not appropriate because both groups already have the outcome of interest (lung cancer). Option D is not appropriate as it compares individuals with different outcomes (lung cancer vs. no lung cancer) rather than comparing exposure to electronic cigarette use."

A cohort study follows a group of people over time, typically divided into an experimental group and a control group. In this case, the researcher wants to study the effects of smoking electronic cigarettes on the risk of developing lung cancer. Therefore, the experimental group should consist of subjects who smoke electronic cigarettes, while the control group should consist of subjects who do not smoke any type of cigarettes, including electronic cigarettes. Option (A) correctly identifies these groups. Option (B) compares different types of cigarettes, which is not the focus of the study. Option (C) compares subjects with an outcome of interest (lung cancer) and subjects without, which is a retrospective case-control study design, not a cohort study. Option (D) compares subjects with an outcome of interest (lung cancer) based on a specific exposure (smoking), which is also a retrospective case-control study design."
