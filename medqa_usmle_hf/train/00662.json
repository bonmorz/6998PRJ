The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, and was recently started on disease-modifying therapy. The laboratory studies do not show significant abnormalities that would suggest anemia as a cause of her fatigue. However, the medication side effect can cause fatigue and weakness as a side effect. Depression can also cause fatigue, but this is less likely given the recent onset of symptoms and the patient's concern about not being able to play sports with her children. Iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency can both cause anemia and fatigue, but the laboratory studies do not support this etiology."

The patient was recently started on disease-modifying therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, which can cause fatigue as a side effect. Iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency can cause anemia and fatigue, but the hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are within normal limits, making them less likely etiologies. Depression is possible, but there are no specific symptoms related to depression mentioned in the question stem.

The patient's recent diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and initiation of disease-modifying therapy suggest that medication side effects may be the most likely cause of her symptoms.
