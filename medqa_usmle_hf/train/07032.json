Scarring of the mitral valve as a complication of a childhood illness and aortic root dilation are not likely to lead to sudden onset symptoms either."

The symptoms and history of abdominal pain suggest that the patient might have had a myocardial infarction in the past. His medications suggest that he has concurrent diabetes and hypertension. The sudden deterioration of his condition suggests acute heart failure, which can be caused by a papillary muscle rupture. Scarring of the mitral valve and age-related fibrosis and calcification of the aortic valve are chronic conditions that may not cause sudden worsening of symptoms. Aortic root dilation may cause aortic regurgitation, but it is less likely to cause sudden respiratory distress."

The symptoms suggest that the patient has suffered a myocardial infarction, and his medications indicate underlying heart disease. The sudden onset of breathlessness and bibasilar crackles suggest that there is fluid in his lungs, which can be caused by papillary muscle rupture leading to reflux of blood into left atrium. Scarring of mitral valve or age-related fibrosis and calcification of the aortic valve may cause similar symptoms, but they are less likely in this case. Aortic root dilation may cause aortic dissection, which usually presents with sudden onset of severe pain rather than breathlessness and crackles."
