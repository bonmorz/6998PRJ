The patient\u2019s symptoms and thyroid enlargement suggest Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and germinal center formation. Antimicrosomal antibody is the most likely autoantibody to be found in this condition. Anti-TSH receptor antibody is associated with Graves\u2019 disease, which presents with hyperthyroidism, not hypothyroidism. Antihistone antibody is associated with drug-induced lupus, and anti-parietal cell antibody is associated with pernicious anemia."
