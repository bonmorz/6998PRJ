The laboratory findings of microcytic anemia, increased TIBC (total iron binding capacity), and decreased ferritin are classic for iron-deficiency anemia, which is commonly caused by menstrual bleeding. Increased ferritin would suggest another cause of anemia, such as inflammation or chronic disease, and normocytic anemia would suggest other causes such as blood loss or kidney disease."
