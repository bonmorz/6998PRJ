Fournier gangrene is a life-threatening infection of the genital and perineal area, and the patient is at high risk of sepsis and shock. While it is important to maintain blood pressure with vasopressors, the immediate next step should be to obtain a chest radiograph to evaluate line placement before using the line for medication administration to prevent complications like pneumothorax. Option A is incorrect because it jumps ahead to starting infusion without first ensuring proper line placement. Option B is incorrect because it assumes proper line placement without verification. Option C is incomplete as verification should always be done with another method, preferably using ultrasound."

Options A and B are incorrect because the priority is to confirm line placement before using it, and norepinephrine should not be administered until line placement is confirmed. Option C is also incorrect because line placement should be confirmed by imaging before using the line."

The patient\u2019s clinical presentation suggests sepsis, therefore obtaining an immediate portable chest radiograph to evaluate line placement is the most appropriate next step before using the central venous catheter for vasopressor administration. Option A is incorrect as vasopressor use should be delayed until the central line has been confirmed to be in the correct location. Option B is incorrect as documentation of dark, non-pulsatile blood may not necessarily indicate correct line placement. Option C may be necessary but should not be the immediate next step in this critically ill patient."
