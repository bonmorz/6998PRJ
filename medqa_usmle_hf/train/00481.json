Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used for emergency treatment of opioid overdose, not for addiction treatment. The statement that the drug is not to be taken on his own and will not work in an emergency situation related to heroin withdrawal further supports the choice of methadone, as it is only effective when used as part of a supervised program."
