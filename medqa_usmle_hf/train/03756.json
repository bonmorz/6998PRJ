Enterococcus faecalis is often naturally resistant to multiple antibiotics due to mutations in the peptidoglycan synthesis pathway, which makes the cell wall stronger and harder to penetrate. This is the most likely mechanism of antibiotic resistance in this patient. Production of beta-lactamase is common in gram-negative bacteria, while alteration of penicillin-binding proteins and ribosomal targets are more common in gram-positive bacteria."
