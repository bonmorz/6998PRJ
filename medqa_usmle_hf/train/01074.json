The thin off-white vaginal discharge with a pH of 5.1 and wet mount exam showing small coccobacilli suggest bacterial vaginosis. The patient\u2019s sexual history and inconsistent condom use suggest a higher risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but the absence of dysuria, dyspareunia, pruritus, or burning makes STIs less likely. Treatment with metronidazole is appropriate for bacterial vaginosis. There is no indication for treating partners unless they are also symptomatic. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin are used to treat gonorrhea and chlamydia, which are less likely given the absence of symptoms suggestive of these infections. Topical ketoconazole is used to treat fungal infections, which are also less likely given the absence of symptoms suggestive of Candida infection."
