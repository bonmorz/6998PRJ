The symptoms of a swollen left big toe and the patient\u2019s history of similar episodes suggest gout, which is caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in a joint. Alcohol increases uric acid production and can trigger an attack. Option C is the correct answer because it describes the mechanism by which neutrophils migrate to the affected joint, which causes inflammation and pain."

The upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules to promote neutrophil migration is a key event in the development of acute gout, leading to an inflammatory response in the joint. This response is triggered by the deposition of urate crystals in the joint, which leads to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1 beta."
