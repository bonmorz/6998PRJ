Among the options, missense mutation in the UGT1A1 gene is responsible for Gilbert's syndrome, where the enzyme responsible for conjugation of bilirubin is impaired. Phenobarbital can increase liver enzyme synthesis, which can help with bilirubin conjugation. The other options are associated with different conditions, such as statin-induced myopathy (A- SLCO1B1 gene deletion) and Crigler-Najjar syndrome (B and D- promoter or nonsense mutation in UGT1A1 gene)."

The presentation of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in a previously healthy infant suggests a diagnosis of physiologic jaundice or breast milk jaundice. However, the patient's history of stomach flu, icteric sclera, and sluggishness suggests a pathologic cause. The most likely cause is a missense mutation in the UGT1A1 gene, which codes for the enzyme responsible for conjugating bilirubin in the liver. This mutation results in decreased enzyme function and thus increased unconjugated bilirubin levels. Treatment with phenobarbital increases liver enzyme synthesis and can help alleviate symptoms. Deletion in the SLCO1B1 gene is associated with statin-induced myopathy, not jaundice. A mutation in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene can also cause decreased enzyme function, but a missense mutation is more common. A nonsense mutation would result in a nonfunctional enzyme and would likely present earlier in life with severe jaundice."

Mutation in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene can also cause unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, but it is less common than missense mutations in the UGT1A1 gene.
