The patient's symptoms, including fever, chills, dyspnea, and productive cough, along with the right lower-lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray suggest community-acquired pneumonia. Given the patient's history of HIV and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, he is at increased risk for opportunistic infections. However, the fact that the patient has been on antiretroviral therapy for four years and has a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count above 500/mm3 makes Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia less likely. Cryptococcus neoformans typically causes meningitis and is rarely a cause of pneumonia. Staphylococcus aureus can cause community-acquired pneumonia, but it typically presents with more severe symptoms and is more common in patients with underlying comorbidities. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, and the patient's symptoms and chest x-ray findings are consistent with this diagnosis."
