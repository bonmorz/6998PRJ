The patient experienced physical stress and the increase in hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine will cause inhibition of Phosphofructokinase, which regulates glycolysis. This is because the body will shift to using stored glycogen for energy during stress rather than relying solely on glycolysis."

One such hormone is insulin, which decreases during stress. As a result, the concentration of glucose in the blood will increase, and the body will switch to anaerobic respiration to generate energy. Phosphofructokinase is the enzyme that catalyzes the third step in glycolysis, which is the main pathway for anaerobic respiration. Insulin inhibits phosphofructokinase, so in the absence of insulin, phosphofructokinase will likely be activated. Therefore, the most likely answer is (B) phosphofructokinase."

The patient hit their head, which is a form of stress that can result in the activation of the \"fight or flight\" response. This would cause a decrease in insulin secretion and an increase in glucagon secretion, leading to an increase in blood glucose levels. Phosphofructokinase is a key enzyme in glycolysis and is allosterically inhibited by ATP, activated by ADP, and inhibited by citrate. Increased glucagon levels would increase levels of AMP and ADP, which would activate the enzyme, leading to an increase in glycolysis and ultimately an increase in ATP production to provide energy for the body to respond to stress."
