The patient has severe cerebral edema and diffuse axonal injury, suggesting the most likely type of herniation found at autopsy is central herniation. Uncal herniation is usually caused by a mass lesion on one side of the brain, while subfalcine herniation is caused by a midline mass effect. Downward cerebellar herniation is also known as tonsillar herniation, which is caused by increased pressure in the posterior fossa. None of these options match the patient\u2019s symptoms as well as central herniation does."

The patient has severe cerebral edema and multiple hemorrhages in the brainstem, which together suggest central herniation.

Subfalcine herniation is when the cingulate gyrus is pushed under the falx cerebri, but this would not cause the findings seen in this case. Downward cerebellar herniation involves the cerebellar tonsils moving downward through the foramen magnum, which is not seen in this case."
