We can calculate the false positives as 120 (number of EBV-positive patients who tested negative). Plugging these values into the formula, specificity = 780 / (780 + 120) = 0.8667, or 86.67%.

However, the question asks for the value after the researcher managed to achieve a greater specificity than her original goal.
