The patient is presenting with symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, and reciprocal ST-depression in leads I and aVL, indicating an inferior wall AMI. Urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the best next step to restore blood flow to the affected area of the heart. Heparin infusion and ICU admission may be indicated after the PCI, but PCI should be performed as soon as possible. A bedside echocardiography can provide additional information, but urgent PCI is the definitive treatment. Monitoring for cardiac troponin levels can provide confirmatory evidence of an AMI, but it is not the best next step in this high-risk patient presenting with an acute coronary syndrome."
