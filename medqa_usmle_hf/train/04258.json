Platelet transfusion may not be effective due to the patient's history of ITP, as the transfused platelets may be destroyed by the patient's own immune system. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulins is a common treatment for acute exacerbations of ITP and can help increase the patient's platelet count. Continuation of corticosteroids may not be effective since the patient has already been treated with them and they were discontinued several weeks ago. Stem cell transplantation is a more extreme option and is typically reserved for patients with chronic or refractory ITP."

A low platelet count, such as the one in this case, puts the patient at risk of bleeding. Platelet transfusion can be used to raise the platelet count, but it is a temporary solution and carries a risk of adverse reactions. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulins can block the immune system from destructing platelets and is a safe and effective treatment for ITP. Continuation of corticosteroids may not be effective for long-term treatment and does not address the current emergency. Stem cell transplantation is performed in select cases of chronic ITP that are refractory to other treatments, but it is not indicated in this acute situation. Therefore, the best next step in the treatment of this patient is administration of intravenous immunoglobulins."
