The pathogenesis of erythema multiforme involves the activation of CD4+ T cells and the production of IFN gamma in the skin. This results in a localized immune reaction, leading to the characteristic skin lesions. Option A (TNF alpha production by CD4+ T cells in the skin) is more commonly associated with psoriasis. Option B (circulating anti-desmoglein antibodies) is associated with pemphigus vulgaris. Option C (IgA deposition in the papillary dermis) is associated with dermatitis herpetiformis."
