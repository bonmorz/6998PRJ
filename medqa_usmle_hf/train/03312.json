This may be due to factors such as access to more lethal means and less help-seeking behavior. Option B is incorrect as females actually attempt suicide more, but are less likely to die from it. Option C is incorrect as suicide is more common in males than females. Option D is incorrect as suicide risk tends to be highest among middle-aged white men, not women."

The fact that he is expressing symptoms of depression and living in a homeless shelter puts him at increased risk for suicide.

Option (B) is not necessarily true, as females actually attempt suicide more often than males.
