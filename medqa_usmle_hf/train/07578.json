The patient experiences palpitations, blushing, and nausea when speaking in public, which suggests social anxiety disorder. The patient's avoidance of class on discussion days also supports this diagnosis. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by eccentric behavior and odd beliefs, which the patient does not exhibit. Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by intense anxiety in social situations, but the patient's symptoms are specific to public speaking. Generalized anxiety disorder involves excessive and pervasive worry, which is not described in the patient's history."

The patient\u2019s symptoms are typical of social anxiety disorder, which is characterized by fear and avoidance of social situations. The symptoms are worse during class when she is occasionally called out to speak, and she has been skipping class on discussion days because she is concerned that her classmates may notice her symptoms. Other options like Schizotypal personality disorder, Avoidant personality disorder, and Generalized anxiety disorder are less likely given the specific symptoms described in the case."

The patient's symptoms of palpitations, sweating, facial blushing, and nausea in social situations and class discussions suggest social anxiety disorder. The fact that she avoids these situations and has gained weight also support this diagnosis. Schizotypal and avoidant personality disorders are characterized by social isolation and difficulty forming relationships, which are not present in this case. Generalized anxiety disorder involves excessive anxiety and worry about a variety of things, but does not specifically involve social situations."

The symptoms of palpitation, sweating, facial blushing, nausea, and avoidance of social situations suggest Social Anxiety Disorder. The patient's anxiety is related to social situations, such as speaking in class or jogging in public, and has caused her to skip class and avoid activities she used to enjoy. Schizotypal Personality Disorder and Avoidant Personality Disorder do not fit the patient's symptoms, as they involve more pervasive and long-standing personality traits. Generalized Anxiety Disorder typically involves excessive worry about a range of issues, rather than specific triggers related to social situations."

The patient's symptoms suggest that she has social anxiety disorder, which is characterized by a fear of embarrassment or humiliation in social situations. The palpitations, sweating, and blushing are symptoms of a panic attack, which can be triggered by being called out to speak in class. The avoidance of class on discussion days and the loss of enjoyment in jogging also suggest social anxiety disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder may have some overlap with social anxiety disorder, but they do not fully explain the patient's symptoms. Generalized anxiety disorder may cause a range of anxiety symptoms but is not specific to social situations."

Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, but symptoms are more severe than what is presented in this case. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive and unrealistic worry about everyday life events, which is not consistent with this patient\u2019s symptoms."
