As the patient had a low dose chest CT scan last year that showed no masses, a repeat chest CT scan is indicated to screen for any possible lung cancer due to his history of tobacco use. Abdominal ultrasound may be indicated for liver and pancreas evaluations, but it does not address his current risk factors. Colonoscopy may be indicated based on age and family history, but there was no mention of family history and the patient had a colonoscopy last year that showed no polyps. A chest radiograph is less sensitive than a CT scan for detecting lung cancer."
