The presence of red blood cell casts and the type of proteins in the urine (albumin, transferrin, and IgG) suggest glomerular involvement. The fact that there is 3+ protein and red blood cell casts in the urine also suggests that it is nonselective, meaning that all types of proteins are being excreted in the urine. Therefore, the best option is nonselective glomerular proteinuria."
