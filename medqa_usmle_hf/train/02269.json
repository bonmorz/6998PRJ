The patient presents with acute onset of neurologic symptoms, splenomegaly, non-palpable purpura, and pale conjunctiva and skin, which suggest a diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The peripheral blood smear shows many schistocytes, which are fragmented red blood cells resulting from microangiopathy. Laboratory findings in TTP typically include elevated levels of bilirubin, a low platelet count, and an elevated reticulocyte count. The patient's history of type 1 diabetes puts her at increased risk for renal involvement, so an elevated creatinine level could be seen in this patient. Therefore, the least likely laboratory finding would be normal PTT and PT, as TTP is associated with prolonged PT and PTT due to consumption of clotting factors."

The patient has symptoms of an acute stroke and a history of diabetes, smoking, and splenomegaly, which suggest a high risk of thrombotic events. The peripheral blood smear also shows thrombocytopenia and fragmented red blood cells, indicating microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Elevated creatinine suggests impaired renal function, but this would not be the least likely finding in this patient. Therefore, the least likely finding in this patient would be normal PTT and PT, as these are tests to evaluate coagulation factors and would be abnormal in the presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Elevated reticulocyte count and elevated bilirubin are expected findings in this patient due to the hemolysis."

The peripheral blood smear supports the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Elevated creatinine is seen in TTP due to kidney damage, and thus it is likely to be seen in this patient. Normal PTT and PT indicate that the coagulation system is intact and functioning normally, which is not expected in TTP. Elevated reticulocyte count and elevated bilirubin are expected in TTP due to accelerated breakdown of red blood cells, so these findings are likely to be seen in the patient. Therefore, the least likely finding is an elevated creatinine level."

The presence of non-palpable purpura, splenomegaly, and pale conjunctiva and skin, as well as the peripheral blood smear image shown in the exhibit, suggest a diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Elevated creatinine levels suggest renal failure, which is a common complication of TTP. Therefore, option (B) is the least likely laboratory finding in this patient. Option (A) is unlikely to be seen because TTP does not affect the coagulation pathway, so the PTT and PT should be normal. Option (C) is likely to be elevated because TTP causes increased destruction of red blood cells, leading to a compensatory increase in reticulocyte count. Option (D) is likely to be elevated because TTP leads to increased breakdown of red blood cells, resulting in elevated bilirubin levels."
