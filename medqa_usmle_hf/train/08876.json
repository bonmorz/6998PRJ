The normal response to the second oral dose of vitamin B12 with intrinsic factor indicates that the patient has pernicious anemia, which is caused by autoimmune destruction of parietal cells in the stomach and a deficiency of intrinsic factor. This places the patient at increased risk for gastric carcinoma. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and celiac disease are not related to the symptoms and findings in the patient. De Quervain thyroiditis is a self-limited thyroid disorder that is not associated with the patient's symptoms."

The patient has symptoms of anemia and reduced sensation to light touch and pinprick in the toes, suggesting a possible vitamin B12 deficiency. The fact that 24-hour urine vitamin B12 levels increase with the addition of oral intrinsic factor indicates a problem with absorption of vitamin B12. The patient\u2019s smoking history puts him at increased risk for gastric carcinoma, which can cause malabsorption of vitamin B12. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, celiac disease, and De Quervain thyroiditis are not directly related to vitamin B12 deficiency or the patient\u2019s symptoms."

The patient's symptoms, especially the reduced sensation and laboratory results, indicate vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. The administration of radiolabeled vitamin B12 and subsequent injection of nonradioactive vitamin B12 with and without intrinsic factor confirms the diagnosis of pernicious anemia, which is caused by decreased production or dysfunction of intrinsic factor. Patients with pernicious anemia are at increased risk for gastric carcinoma. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with insulin resistance and abnormal glucose metabolism. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that damages the small intestine when gluten-containing foods are consumed. De Quervain thyroiditis is an inflammatory condition of the thyroid gland."

The patient has anemia, a low B12 level, and reduced sensation in the toes, indicating a possible B12 deficiency neuropathy. The results of the oral radiolabeled vitamin B12 are consistent with pernicious anemia, which is associated with an increased risk of gastric carcinoma. Type 2 diabetes is not directly related to B12 deficiency. Celiac disease can impact absorption of nutrients, but it is not specifically associated with B12 deficiency. De Quervain thyroiditis is an inflammatory condition of the thyroid gland and is not related to B12 deficiency."

The oral administration of radiolabeled vitamin B12 followed by an intramuscular injection of nonradioactive vitamin B12 and an increase in urine vitamin B12 levels with the addition of oral intrinsic factor suggests a diagnosis of pernicious anemia, which is commonly caused by autoimmune destruction of the parietal cells in the gastric mucosa. Patients with pernicious anemia are at increased risk for gastric carcinoma. Thus, the correct answer is (D)."
