Central sleep apnea is a type of sleep apnea where there is a failure in the brain to send the proper signals to the muscles that control breathing. The patient's history of sleep apnea and the presence of episodes of apnea even after surgery suggest that the underlying cause is central sleep apnea rather than obstructive sleep apnea or incorrect ventilator settings. Heart failure may contribute to sleep apnea, but it is not the most likely underlying cause in this case."
