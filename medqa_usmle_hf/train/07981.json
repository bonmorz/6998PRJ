The x-ray shows a left-sided pneumothorax, which means that air has escaped from the lung and is now filling the pleural space. This may cause a shift in the mediastinum to the right, leading to increased pressure on the right side of the heart, resulting in increased right-to-left shunting. This can cause hypoxemia and can be life-threatening. Increased transpulmonary pressure and increased dead space are unlikely in this scenario as they are not directly related to a pneumothorax. Lung compliance may increase initially as the lung has less resistance and is easier to expand; however, this is unlikely to be the immediate result of this condition."
