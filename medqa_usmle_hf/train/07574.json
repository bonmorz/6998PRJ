In case of a needlestick exposure, immediate management includes washing the wound with soap and water or antiseptic solution, and initiating post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) consisting of antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible. In this case, since the source patient\u2019s HIV viral load is high, and there is a risk of transmission, the best next step is to draw the female medical student\u2019s repeat HIV serology and immediately initiate three-drug ART. This will reduce the risk of HIV transmission and possibly prevent infection. Performing genotype testing on the source patient would not change the management of the exposed medical student."
