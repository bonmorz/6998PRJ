The patient's symptoms, history of smoking, and lung function test results suggest that the most likely condition is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Smoking cessation is the most effective intervention to slow the progression of COPD. The other options may be helpful in managing symptoms or preventing exacerbations, but they will not slow the progression of the disease. Discontinuing lisinopril may actually worsen the patient's hypertension and should not be done without a clear indication."
