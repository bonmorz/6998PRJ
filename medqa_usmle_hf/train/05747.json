The symptoms described are consistent with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) which occurs when donor T-cells recognize the recipient's tissues as foreign and attack them. This is more common in solid organ transplantation, but can occur following liver transplant as well. The symptoms described in the question suggest that it is the donor T-cells that are mediating the symptoms."
