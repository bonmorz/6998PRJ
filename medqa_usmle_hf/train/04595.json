The foul-smelling discharge from one side of the nose without any history of trauma, tenderness or abnormality on X-ray suggests the most likely cause is a nasal foreign body. Bilateral maxillary sinusitis would have shown an abnormality on X-ray and would not have unilateral symptoms. Septal hematoma would cause swelling and pain, and a nasal tumor is rare in a child."

The history of foul-smelling discharge oozing out from one nostril in a young child with no history of trauma raised suspicion for a nasal foreign body. The X-ray image showed no abnormality, which is consistent with a foreign body that is not radiopaque. Bilateral maxillary sinusitis would typically present with bilateral symptoms, fever, and tenderness over the sinus areas. Septal hematoma and nasal tumor are rare diagnoses and would require further evaluation."

Nasal tumor is unlikely in a 4-year-old and would require further investigation with imaging or biopsy to confirm."
