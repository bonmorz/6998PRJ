The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a diagnosis of phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive disorder in which the body cannot metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. The recommended dietary treatment for PKU is to avoid foods that are high in protein, such as meat, and instead consume a special low-protein diet containing restricted amounts of fruits, dairy products, and bread. Therefore, the most appropriate dietary recommendation in this case is to avoid meat."
