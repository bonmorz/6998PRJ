Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Adenylate cyclase."

The question is asking about a medication that successfully controls bedwetting, so we can assume it is a medication for enuresis. Among the options in the answer choices, only Adenylate cyclase is associated with the mechanism of action of medications used to treat enuresis, such as Desmopressin. Adenylate cyclase is responsible for producing cyclic AMP, which helps improve urine concentration and reduce bedwetting."

The medication prescribed for bedwetting in children is most likely a selective antidiuretic hormone (ADH) antagonist, such as desmopressin. ADH acts on the principal cells in the collecting tubules of the kidney, increasing water reabsorption and decreasing urine output. ADH activates adenylate cyclase, leading to increased levels of cyclic AMP, which in turn causes translocation of aquaporins to the apical membrane of principal cells, thereby increasing water permeability. Therefore, the most likely effect of the medication is increased activity of adenylate cyclase."

The medication prescribed to control bedwetting is most likely a desmopressin nasal spray or a tricyclic antidepressant. Both medications work by increasing the concentration of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in the body, which increases the reabsorption of water from the kidneys and decreases urine production. ADH binds to receptors on the principal cells of the kidney and activates adenylate cyclase, increasing the production of cyclic AMP and leading to increased water reabsorption.
