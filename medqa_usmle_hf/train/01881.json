The patient has symptoms of uveitis, an inflammatory process affecting the uveal tract, and is most likely a result of the Crohn's disease. The most appropriate modification to her medication at this time would be to increase the dose of prednisone, which is a potent anti-inflammatory drug that can help to reduce the inflammation in the eye. Adding infliximab may be an option, but it is a second-line drug and not recommended as the initial modification. Discontinuing sulfasalazine may not be helpful in this case as it is not associated with uveitis."

Among the options, increasing the dose of prednisone is the most appropriate choice as it is a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation. Adding infliximab, a biologic agent, is a more aggressive option and discontinuing sulfasalazine is not recommended as it is not known to be causally related to anterior uveitis."
