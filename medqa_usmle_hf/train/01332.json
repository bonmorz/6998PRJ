Out of the options, only aldosterone levels are unlikely to be affected by Sheehan syndrome, as aldosterone is produced by the adrenal gland, not the pituitary gland."

Aldosterone production is regulated by the adrenal gland, which is not affected by this condition, and therefore aldosterone levels are most likely to be normal. Antidiuretic hormone, cortisol, and luteinizing hormone are all produced by the pituitary gland and may be affected by hypopituitarism."

Elevated antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are possible. Cortisol may be elevated due to stress from childbirth and lactation failure. But, since the patient has been experiencing weight gain, fatigue, and lightheadedness, it's possible that aldosterone levels may be decreased due to adrenal insufficiency caused by autoimmune adrenalitis that can occur with postpartum thyroiditis. Therefore, the most likely normal hormone level in this patient is aldosterone."
