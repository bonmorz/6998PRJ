Crystal-induced acute kidney injury is unlikely as there were no crystals found in the urine.

The presence of a maculopapular rash suggests an allergic reaction, making allergic interstitial nephritis the most likely diagnosis. The absence of bacteria in the urine and lack of other signs of infection make pyelonephritis less likely. Crystal-induced acute kidney injury would usually present with signs of crystal deposition in the urine, which is not seen in this case.
