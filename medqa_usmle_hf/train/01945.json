The symptoms suggest that the boy is experiencing a severe adverse drug reaction to penicillin, which has caused toxic epidermal necrolysis. The positive Nikolsky's sign, sloughing of skin, and involvement of mucous membranes all support this diagnosis. Erythema multiforme typically involves a target-like rash and is commonly associated with infections. Rocky Mountain spotted fever would present with fever, rash, and flu-like symptoms, but would not cause such widespread skin sloughing. Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune disorder that typically presents with blisters rather than a rash."

Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever is a rickettsial infection that presents with fever, headache, and rash, but doesn't typically involve skin sloughing or mucosal involvement. Pemphigus Vulgaris is an autoimmune disorder that presents with blisters on the skin and mucous membranes but doesn't typically involve skin sloughing."

The symptoms suggest Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, a rare but potentially fatal skin condition usually caused by a reaction to medications like penicillin. The Nikolsky's sign refers to the ability to separate the superficial layer of the skin from the deeper layer by applying lateral pressure with a finger. This sign indicates an epidermal detachment and is commonly seen in Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis."

The symptoms of a fever, rash, sloughing skin, and involvement of mucous membranes suggest toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The positive Nikolsky's sign is a characteristic finding seen in TEN, where slight rubbing of the skin causes it to slough off. Erythema multiforme involves less than 10% of the body surface area and does not have the same degree of mucous membrane involvement as TEN. Rocky Mountain spotted fever does not typically present with a rash that sloughs off, and pemphigus vulgaris typically presents with blisters, not sloughing of the skin."
