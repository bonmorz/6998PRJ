Seawater has a higher salt concentration than human blood, and ingestion can lead to hypernatremia or high levels of sodium in the blood. Hypernatremia can lead to water leaving the cells and entering the extracellular fluid (ECF), which increases ECF volume and decreases intracellular fluid (ICF) volume. This leads to increased body osmolality or concentration of particles in the body, which can cause confusion and thirst. Therefore, the correct option is (D) which indicates increased ECF volume, decreased ICF volume, and increased body osmolality."

Sodium is a major extracellular cation and excess sodium intake or retention will increase extracellular fluid (ECF) volume, leading to increased blood pressure and edema. In severe cases, the high sodium concentration in the ECF can also draw water from intracellular fluid (ICF) to compensate, causing a decrease in ICF volume and an increase in body osmolality. Option (D) is the only option that includes an increase in ECF volume and a decrease in ICF volume with an increase in body osmolality, matching the patient's condition."
