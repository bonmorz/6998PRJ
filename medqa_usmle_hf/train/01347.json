The symptoms and physical exam findings suggest hyperthyroidism, which can cause muscle weakness, tremors, weight loss, and insomnia.

Anti-Mi-2 antibody positivity is associated with dermatomyositis, which is not suggested by the symptoms and physical exam findings. Increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a non-specific finding and may be present in various conditions. Normal laboratory results are unlikely in this patient given her symptoms and clinical presentation."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest hyperthyroidism, including unintentional weight loss, tremors, and difficulty sleeping. Elevated blood pressure is also associated with hyperthyroidism.

Anti-Mi-2 antibody positivity is associated with dermatomyositis and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate is a nonspecific marker of inflammation, neither of which are likely to explain the patient\u2019s symptoms.
