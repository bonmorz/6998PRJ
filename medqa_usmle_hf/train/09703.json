The symptoms and laboratory findings suggest that the most likely diagnosis is pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

The bone marrow aspirate shows immature leukocytes that stain positive for CD10, CD19, and TdT, which are indicative of pre-B-cell ALL. Hairy cell leukemia presents with pancytopenia, not just thrombocytopenia, and does not involve lymph nodes. Acute myelomonocytic leukemia involves more mature cells and would not show CD10 or CD19 positivity. T-cell CLL is rare in children and would not present with these symptoms."

CD10 and CD19 are both expressed on B cells, and TdT is expressed in early B cells and T cells, but not in myeloid cells. Hairy cell leukemia is a rare type of B-cell leukemia with distinctive hairy projections on the surface. Acute myelomonocytic leukemia is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia. T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia is an extremely rare type of leukemia, and it usually presents in older patients."
