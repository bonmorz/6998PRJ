The history of tick bite and treatment with amoxicillin suggest Lyme disease, but the symptoms are more consistent with osteoarthritis. Gout would present with sudden onset of severe pain and swelling in a joint. Septic arthritis would present with fever, severe pain, and joint warmth and redness."

The symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of osteoarthritis, which commonly affects weight-bearing joints and can cause morning stiffness that lasts less than 30 minutes. The history of a tick bite and treatment with amoxicillin make Lyme arthritis a possibility, but the presentation is not typical for Lyme arthritis. Gout and septic arthritis are possible differential diagnoses, but the presence of nodules on the interphalangeal joints suggests osteoarthritis."

The patient has symptoms suggestive of osteoarthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease that commonly affects weight-bearing joints. The knee pain is worse with activity and there is limited range of motion with palpable crepitus. The tender nodules on the fingers suggest Heberden's nodes, which are associated with osteoarthritis. Lyme arthritis may cause joint pain and swelling, but it would have presented shortly after the tick bite and would not have lasted for 2 years. Gout typically affects the first metatarsophalangeal joint and is associated with elevated serum uric acid levels. Septic arthritis is a medical emergency and presents with severe joint pain, fever, and joint effusion."
