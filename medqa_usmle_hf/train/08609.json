Bilateral adnexal masses indicate the presence of ovarian cysts, which are a common feature of PCOS. The most appropriate next step in management is monitoring, as the patient is pregnant and surgical intervention carries risks. Diagnostic laparoscopy and oophorectomy should only be considered if the masses continue to grow or cause complications. Measurement of serum CEA is not relevant in this case, as CEA is a tumor marker used to detect cancers, and there is no indication of cancer in this patient."

Option A or B may be considered after delivery of the baby. Option D, measurement of serum CEA, is not indicated in this case as it is a marker for cancer, not ovarian hyperthecosis or a virilizing tumor."

Since the pregnancy is live and the ultrasound shows no other problems, the most appropriate next step in management would be monitoring. Surgery or diagnostic laparoscopy can be considered after delivery if the tumors grow rapidly or if the patient has any cancer markers. Serum CEA is not commonly elevated in ovarian tumors, and unlikely to help in this case."
