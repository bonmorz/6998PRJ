Among the options, Enterovirus is the most common cause of viral meningitis, accounting for up to 90% of cases. Brucellosis usually presents with fever, chills, and muscle pain. Mumps meningitis usually presents with bilateral parotid swelling. Ehrlichiosis usually presents with fever, headache, and muscle aches."

The patient\u2019s symptoms and CSF analysis are consistent with a diagnosis of enterovirus meningitis, which is typically characterized by fever, headache, photophobia, and meningismus. The absence of erythrocytes in the CSF and the predominance of lymphocytes support this diagnosis. Brucellosis typically presents with fever, malaise, and anorexia, but typically without neurological symptoms. Mumps meningitis would present with parotid gland swelling and possibly orchitis, but not a rash or CSF findings like those observed here. Ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne illness that can cause fever, headache, and myalgias, but typically has thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes, and would not explain the CSF findings observed in this patient."
