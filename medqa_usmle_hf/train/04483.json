The total population at risk is 2540 - 70 = 2470 (excluding those who have already reached the average life expectancy). The annual incidence rate is therefore 510/2470 x 1000 = 206.1. To estimate the number of individuals who would newly develop fasting hyperglycemia over 1 year, we multiply the annual incidence rate by the population at risk, and then divide by 1000. This gives: 206.1 x 2470/1000 = 509.047, which we round to 509. Therefore, the best estimate of the number of individuals who would newly develop fasting hyperglycemia over 1 year is 509/12 = 42.4 or approximately 20 (rounded to the nearest whole number).

Assuming a steady state of population, the number of individuals who develop fasting hyperglycemia each year would be equal to the incidence rate multiplied by the population. The average age of onset is 45 years, so we assume that individuals older than 45 are at risk of developing fasting hyperglycemia. The number of individuals older than 45 on the island is 2540*(70-45)/70 = 1078. Therefore, the incidence rate is 1 year/25 years * 510/1078 = 0.19, or approximately 19%.

We can estimate the number of individuals who would develop fasting hyperglycemia over one year and also die within that year by multiplying the number of new cases by the proportion of life expectancy remaining for those individuals: 81 x (25-45)/25 = -32.4 individuals. \nThis negative number suggests that we overestimated the number of new cases, as some individuals with fasting hyperglycemia would already be deceased. Therefore, the best estimate of the number of individuals who would newly develop fasting hyperglycemia over 1 year is likely to be lower than 81. Among the given options, the best estimate is 20 (answer choice D)."

Person-time at risk can be estimated as the average life expectancy of the population multiplied by the population size. So, person-time at risk = 70 years x 2540 individuals = 177,800 person-years. The incidence rate can be estimated as 510 cases / 177,800 person-years = 0.0029 cases/person-year. To estimate the number of individuals who would newly develop fasting hyperglycemia over 1 year, we multiply the incidence rate by the number of persons at risk (i.e. the population size) for 1 year: 0.0029 cases/person-year x 2540 individuals = 7.37 cases. Thus, the best estimate of the number of individuals who would newly develop fasting hyperglycemia over 1 year is approximately 7. Rounded to the nearest integer, the answer is (D) 20.

The average life expectancy on the island is 70 years, so the number of individuals with fasting hyperglycemia who are older than 70 years can be assumed to remain relatively constant. Therefore, the number of individuals who develop fasting hyperglycemia in 1 year is most likely equal to the number of individuals who pass the age of onset in 1 year, i.e. 2540/25 = 101.6 individuals. However, we must also take into account the fact that some individuals may die before reaching the age of onset. Assuming an equal distribution of ages, the probability of dying before age 45 is approximately 45/70, or 0.64. Therefore, the expected number of individuals who develop fasting hyperglycemia in 1 year is 101.6 x (1 - 0.64) = 36.58, which is closest to answer choice (D), 20."
