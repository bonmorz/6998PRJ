The sudden onset of lower back pain radiating down the leg, along with positive straight leg raise test, suggests the most likely diagnosis is a disc herniation. Osteomyelitis would have more systemic symptoms, such as fever, and would likely involve more than just the lower back. Spinal stenosis typically presents with a gradual onset of symptoms, and ankylosing spondylitis is characterized by stiffness and limited mobility."

The sudden onset of lower back pain and radiation of pain down the leg with a straight leg raise suggests disc herniation.

Spinal stenosis presents with neurogenic claudication and numbness/tingling in the bilateral lower extremities. Ankylosing spondylitis presents with stiffness in the lower back and hip joints, usually in young males. The intact sensation to light touch and pin-prick helps rule out any nerve damage."
