Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient would be hyperphosphorylated tau inclusion bodies. Alpha-synuclein is associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease and Lewy body dementia, while large intracellular vacuoles and perivascular inflammation are not typically observed in frontotemporal dementia."
