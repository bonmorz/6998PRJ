Propylthiouracil and methimazole are antithyroid drugs that will reduce the production of thyroid hormone, but they take time to work and are not the initial treatment choice.

The irregularly irregular pulse suggests atrial fibrillation, which can occur in patients with hyperthyroidism. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can control symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including palpitations and tremors. Propylthiouracil and Methimazole are used to treat hyperthyroidism, but they take longer to work and are used more for long-term management rather than acute control of symptoms. Warfarin is not indicated in this case as there is no indication of a thrombotic event or atrial fibrillation with a high risk of embolism."
