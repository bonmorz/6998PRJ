The most likely explanation for the increase in the host range of HIV is through mutation of the gene coding for viral surface glycoproteins. These glycoproteins play a crucial role in the virus's ability to infect specific cells, and a mutation in these genes can allow the virus to infect previously non-permissive cells. Point mutations in hemagglutinin genes are associated with influenza viruses, while reassortment of genetic material between two viruses is associated with segmented viruses such as influenza and rotavirus. Excessive activity of viral RNA polymerase may result in increased viral replication but would not necessarily increase the host range of the virus."
