Burns to the buttocks are less specific for physical abuse and may suggest other types of trauma. Epidural hematoma is less likely in this case, as the CT scan revealed a subdural hematoma."

The presentation of lethargy and confusion after a traumatic event, along with the presence of a subdural hematoma and a cigarette burn on the patient\u2019s arm, suggests non-accidental trauma (NAT). Bilateral retinal hemorrhages are a common finding in NAT and it is the most likely additional finding. Posterior rib fractures and burns to buttocks are also common findings in NAT, but they are not as strongly associated with this type of trauma as retinal hemorrhages. Epidural hematoma is less likely because the mechanism of injury is not consistent with an epidural hematoma."
