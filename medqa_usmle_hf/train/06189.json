The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with rickets, which is caused by defective growth plate mineralization due to a deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphorus. This leads to soft bones, leg bowing, and widening of the wrists. The erosion of the enamel on lingual surface of incisors, carious molars, and beading of the ribs suggest hypocalcemia. Mutations of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 lead to achondroplasia, a form of short-limbed dwarfism, and do not cause rickets. Deficiency of osteoclasts causes osteopetrosis, a condition where bones become denser and harder, but this is not consistent with the patient\u2019s symptoms. Osteoid proliferation in the subperiosteal bone causes osteomalacia, but this is a condition that occurs in adults and not in infants."

The patient has signs of rickets, with dry mucous membranes, erosion of enamel, carious molars, frontal bossing, widened wrists, bent legs, and rib beading. Defective growth plate mineralization is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's delay in walking, as rickets causes softening of bones and growth plate abnormalities. Mutations of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 cause achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism, but would not cause the symptoms seen in this patient. Deficiency of osteoclasts to reabsorb bone and osteoid proliferation in the subperiosteal bone are not the typical causes of rickets."
