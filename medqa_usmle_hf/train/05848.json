Option (D) is the correct choice because it is a violation of patient confidentiality to discuss the patient's condition with someone who does not have explicit permission from the patient. The physician should explain this to the cousin and encourage the patient to provide a medical power of attorney and advanced directive. It is not appropriate to give a specific discharge date without further assessment and planning, and referring the cousin to the patient's wife is not appropriate as she may not be the designated decision-maker. Directing the cousin to the patient's room without prior notification to the patient is also not appropriate."
