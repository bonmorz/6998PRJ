The patient has an elevated blood pressure and elevated LDL-C, which puts her at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Antihypertensive medication is already prescribed, and the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for elevated LDL-C is statins, such as atorvastatin. Evolocumab is a PCSK9 inhibitor and is typically used for those who cannot tolerate statins or have persistently high LDL levels despite statin therapy. Ezetimibe is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor and may be used in combination with statin therapy, but starting with a statin alone is appropriate in this case. No pharmacotherapy at this time is not appropriate given the patient\u2019s level of cardiovascular risk."

Atorvastatin is a statin that can reduce LDL-C levels and reduce the risk of CVD. Evolocumab is a PCSK9 inhibitor that can also reduce LDL-C, but it is typically reserved for patients who have not responded to statin therapy. Ezetimibe is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor that can be used in combination with a statin to further reduce LDL-C levels. However, since the patient's 10-year risk of CVD is already moderate (3.6%), pharmacotherapy to reduce LDL-C levels is appropriate at this time. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Atorvastatin."
