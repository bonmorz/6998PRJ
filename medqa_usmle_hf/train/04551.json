The addition of a selective \u03b12 adrenergic receptor agonist suggests that the drug is decreasing peripheral sympathetic outflow, which can help lower blood pressure. Option (A) is incorrect because negative inotropic effect on the heart can decrease cardiac output and worsen hypertension. Option (B) is incorrect as selective \u03b12 agonists mainly affect arteriolar resistance, whereas veins contribute very little to total arterial resistance. Option (C) is incorrect because peripheral arterial vasodilation can lead to reflex tachycardia and increased cardiac output, which can worsen hypertension."
