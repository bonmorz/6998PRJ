The symptoms and physical examination are indicative of DiGeorge syndrome, which is caused by a deletion on chromosome 22q11.2.

Hypertrophy of Hassall's corpuscles is a finding in autoimmune diseases affecting the thymus. Absent follicles in the lymph nodes can be seen in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency. Accessory spleens are a common finding in the general population and are not specific to any disease process."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, as well as the FISH analysis indicating 22q11.2 deletion, suggest a diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome. Aplastic thymus is a common finding in DiGeorge syndrome due to the failure of development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches, which leads to a lack of T lymphocytes. Hypertrophy of Hassall's corpuscles is associated with autoimmune conditions such as autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1. Absent follicles in the lymph nodes are seen in patients with X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome. Accessory spleen is a benign anomaly that is detected in approximately 10% of autopsies."
