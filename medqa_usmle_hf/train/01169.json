The patient's symptoms suggest pre-eclampsia, which is characterized by hypertension, proteinuria, and endothelial dysfunction. Abnormal remodeling of spiral arteries in the placenta causes inadequate perfusion, leading to ischemia and endothelial dysfunction, which leads to the release of vasoactive substances and contributes to hypertension and proteinuria. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. Vasogenic cerebral edema, hyperperfusion of placental tissue, and overactivation of the coagulation cascade are all seen in severe cases of pre-eclampsia but are not the primary component of the pathogenesis."
