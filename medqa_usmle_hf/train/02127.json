The patient presents with sudden, severe epigastric pain that radiates to the back and laboratory studies show elevated lipase and amylase, suggesting acute pancreatitis. An abdominal ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as gallstones. Contrast-enhanced CT scan may be used if there are complications or if the diagnosis remains unclear. Plain x-ray and blood alcohol level assay are not necessary for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis."

The most appropriate next step in management is a right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for gallstones as a cause of the pancreatitis. Option A, a CT scan, may be appropriate if the ultrasound is inconclusive, and option C, a plain x-ray, is not helpful for evaluating pancreatitis. Option D, a blood alcohol level assay, may be useful in evaluating a potential cause of pancreatitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management."

The patient presents with sudden, severe epigastric pain and vomiting after dinner and drinks, which suggests acute pancreatitis. Elevated lipase and amylase further support this diagnosis. The presence of epigastric tenderness and guarding on abdominal examination warrants imaging to rule out complications such as pancreatic pseudocyst, ascites, or pancreatic necrosis. Right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound is the most appropriate initial imaging modality for evaluating the biliary system and the pancreas. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan may be necessary if the ultrasound is inconclusive or if complications are suspected. Plain x-ray of the abdomen and blood alcohol level assay are not likely to provide useful diagnostic information in this scenario."

The patient\u2019s symptoms and laboratory findings suggest acute pancreatitis, but further imaging is needed to rule out other possible causes such as cholecystitis or biliary obstruction. A right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound is a noninvasive and quick imaging option that can detect abnormalities in the gallbladder and biliary tree. A contrast-enhanced CT scan may also be necessary, but it carries the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy and radiation exposure. A plain x-ray of the abdomen may be useful to diagnose bowel obstruction, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. A blood alcohol level assay may be helpful in determining the cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms, but it does not aid in management."
