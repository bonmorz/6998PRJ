This points to the presence of a third heart sound (S3), which can be a normal finding in young individuals or can indicate pathological conditions such as heart failure. An opening snap is heard in mitral stenosis, a mid-systolic click is heard in mitral valve prolapse, and S2 is a normal splitting of the second heart sound."

The second heart sound (S2) is a normal component of the cardiac cycle and would be expected to be heard in any patient with a normal heart rhythm."
