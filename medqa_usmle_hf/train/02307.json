Colorectal carcinoma is also a possibility but the patient had a colonoscopy 3 years ago which did not show any evidence of malignancy. Hemorrhoids do not typically cause blood in the stool."

Hemorrhoids can also cause rectal bleeding, but it usually occurs with bowel movements and not intermittently. Colorectal carcinoma can cause rectal bleeding, but the fact that the patient had a recent colonoscopy makes this less likely. Pseudomembranous colitis is unlikely given that the patient's recent antibiotic use was 2 months ago, and the blood in the stool has been occurring for the past 8 weeks."

The patient has a history of constipation and recent antibiotic use, suggesting diverticulosis, which can present as painless rectal bleeding. Colorectal carcinoma usually presents with a change in bowel habits and weight loss, while hemorrhoids typically cause pain and itching. Pseudomembranous colitis would have more severe diarrhea and fever. The low hemoglobin and pale conjunctivae suggest anemia, possibly related to chronic bleeding. Further workup, such as a colonoscopy or imaging, may be needed to confirm the diagnosis."
