The CT scan shows evidence of chronic pancreatitis, which is supported by the patient\u2019s history of multiple similar episodes of abdominal pain and steatorrhea. Low serum trypsin and low stool elastase are the most specific laboratory results for pancreatic insufficiency, which is a common complication of chronic pancreatitis. Elevated amylase and lipase can also be seen in acute pancreatitis, but they are not specific to chronic pancreatitis. High serum trypsin and high stool elastase would be indicative of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, but this is not likely in this case as the patient is experiencing steatorrhea. Elevated alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin are not specific to chronic pancreatitis."
