The description of the drug's mechanism suggests that it is a DMARD (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug) used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The drug that meets this description and inhibits deoxythymidine monophosphate synthesis is methotrexate. Among the options, only trimethoprim is structurally similar to methotrexate and inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase, which also results in decreased deoxythymidine monophosphate synthesis. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Trimethoprim."
