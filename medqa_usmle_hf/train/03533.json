However, a venous ultrasound is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Starting intravenous heparin therapy immediately without confirming the diagnosis can put the patient at risk of bleeding without improving the outcome. Intravenous venography is not routinely performed for the diagnosis of DVT because it is invasive and has a risk of causing deep vein thrombosis. Therefore, the next best step in the management of this patient is to perform a venous ultrasound."
