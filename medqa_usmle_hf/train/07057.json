The patient's recent travel to a sheep farm in South America increases the likelihood of infection from the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus, which causes this disease. The absence of other liver lesions or organomegaly makes liver abscess or hepatocellular carcinoma less likely, and the lesion is not consistent with a hemangioma."
