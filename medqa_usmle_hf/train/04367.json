The patient's history of intermittent kidney stones and severe flank pain suggests that he is experiencing an acute kidney stone. The gross hematuria seen on examination is also indicative of this. Pain medicine is known to contribute to the formation of kidney stones due to its association with dehydration and decreased urine flow, both of which promote stone formation. Alcohols and proton pump inhibitors are not known to increase the risk of kidney stones. Antihypertensives may contribute to the risk of kidney stones, but in this case, pain medicine is the more likely culprit."
