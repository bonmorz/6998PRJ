CT scan would not be the next step in management for rectal bleeding, especially in the absence of other concerning symptoms such as abdominal pain. Mesalamine enema is a treatment option for inflammatory bowel disease, but without a confirmed diagnosis, it is premature to initiate treatment. Stool culture and analysis for red blood cells and leukocytes is not necessary as there is no evidence of infection or inflammation on laboratory studies."

Since the bleeding is bright red and small in amount, it is likely from the lower rectum or anal canal. Anoscopy would be the next best step in management to visualize the rectal and anal area for any signs of bleeding or other pathology. CT scan is not indicated at this point as there are no signs of systemic illness. Mesalamine enema would be more appropriate for inflammatory bowel disease, which is not suggested by the history and physical exam findings. Stool culture and analysis may be considered if infectious etiologies are suspected, but first-line evaluation should include visualization of the affected area."
