Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic drug that inhibits the vagally-mediated contraction of bronchial smooth muscles. This relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscles leads to bronchodilation and improved airflow, which can alleviate shortness of breath and cough. Option A is incorrect because mast cell degranulation is not involved in the mechanism of action of ipratropium bromide. Option B is incorrect because adenosine receptor inhibition is not involved in the mechanism of action of ipratropium bromide. Option D is incorrect because vagally-mediated dryness in the respiratory mucosa is not the primary issue that causes shortness of breath, coughing, and crackles."
