The patient experienced a sudden and severe headache and has symptoms of vomiting, difficulty walking, and neurological deficits. The location of the headache in the back of the head and the ataxic gait point towards a cerebellar hemorrhage, which is a common cause of these symptoms. The nystagmus and abnormal heel to shin exam also suggest a cerebellar lesion. The other options do not fit the clinical picture as well."

The patient's symptoms, including sudden and severe headache, vomiting, difficulty walking, and ataxia, suggest a cerebellar hemorrhage. The minor weakness of the muscles of facial expression, notable nystagmus, and abnormal heel-to-shin exam also indicate cerebellar involvement. The fact that the patient localizes the headache to the back of his head further supports this diagnosis. Subarachnoid hemorrhages typically present with a sudden, severe headache that peaks within seconds to minutes and is often described as \"the worst headache of my life.\" Pontine and thalamic hemorrhages may present with different neurological deficits, such as cranial nerve palsies or hemiparesis. The non-contrast CT scan of the head will help confirm the diagnosis."

The sudden and severe headache, vomiting, difficulty walking, and neurological abnormalities suggest a cerebellar hemorrhage. The location of the patient's headache (back of the head) and the ataxia on gait examination are also suggestive of a cerebellar lesion. A non-contrast CT scan of the head is pending to confirm the diagnosis. Pontine hemorrhage is unlikely as it would not cause the patient's headache or facial weakness, and thalamic hemorrhage typically presents with sensory or motor deficits but not ataxia.
