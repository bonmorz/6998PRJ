When a ureteral stone is lodged, it leads to an increase in Bowman's space hydrostatic pressure, which can lead to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate. This is due to the back pressure of urine in the renal tubules, which can impede the flow of blood into the glomerulus. Therefore, the answer is (B) increase in Bowman's space hydrostatic pressure.
