In this case, the odds ratio for developing diabetes in the western diet group compared to the Mediterranean diet group is:\n\n(36/264) / (9/291) = 1.36 / 0.03 = 45.3\n\nThis means that the odds of developing diabetes are 45.3 times higher in the western diet group compared to the Mediterranean diet group. However, the answer choices are not in this format, so we need to calculate the log odds ratio and then use exponentiation to get the final answer. The log odds ratio is:\n\nlog(45.3) = 3.8\n\nSo the odds ratio is:\n\ne^3.8 = 44.6\n\nRound this to one decimal place, and the answer is (C) 4.4. Therefore, the odds of developing diabetes are 4.4 times higher in the western diet group compared to the Mediterranean diet group."
