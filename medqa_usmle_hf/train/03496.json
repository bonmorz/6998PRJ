The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends that advance care planning should begin as early as possible after a diagnosis of advanced cancer, including discussion of advance directives, and should be revisited throughout the course of the illness. Therefore, the physician should initiate a discussion with the patient about advance directive planning at this visit. Option A is incorrect because it is never too late to discuss advance directives, even if the patient is already ill. Option C is incorrect because hospice care is typically initiated in the last few months of life, whereas advance care planning should start much earlier. Option D is incorrect because the responsibility for initiating these discussions should not be solely on the patient, but on the healthcare team to provide appropriate guidance and support."
