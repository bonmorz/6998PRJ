The spoon-shaped nails and conjunctival pallor are characteristic of iron-deficiency anemia, but the patient\u2019s iron studies show high ferritin levels. The low MCV also suggests a microcytic type of anemia, which can be seen in both iron-deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease. However, the high serum ferritin level is more indicative of anemia of chronic disease, which is common in patients with arthritis. Beta-thalassemia would show an abnormal peripheral smear and Lead poisoning anemia would result in a high MCV."

The patient has symptoms of fatigue and paleness, along with spoon-shaped nails and conjunctival pallor, indicating anemia. The normal peripheral blood smear rules out hemolysis and the low MCV and low serum iron indicate microcytic anemia, further supported by the high ferritin level. The patient\u2019s history of arthritis suggests chronic inflammation, which can lead to anemia of chronic disease. Thus, option (A) is the most likely diagnosis."

Instead, it suggests the patient has anemia of chronic disease, which is characterized by low MCV, low serum iron, and high ferritin levels. Betal-thalassemia can also cause microcytic anemia, but it is less likely in this patient with history of arthritis.

Anemia of chronic disease is characterized by low MCV, normal peripheral blood smear, and high ferritin. The patient's history of 10 years of arthritis also supports this diagnosis as chronic inflammation can lead to anemia of chronic disease."
