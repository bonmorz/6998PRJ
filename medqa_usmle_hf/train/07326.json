Pediatric records indicate the patient is not immune to measles, mumps, and rubella, so she should receive the MMR vaccine postpartum. Serology would confirm immunity status and inform postpartum vaccination. Immune globulin is not necessary in this situation. Smoking cessation counseling should also be provided as smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of complications such as preterm delivery and low birth weight."
