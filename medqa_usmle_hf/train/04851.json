The rash in the picture shows small, dome-shaped papules with central umbilication, characteristic of molluscum contagiosum virus.

VZV presents as a vesicular rash, typically in a dermatomal distribution, and is associated with a history of chickenpox. The patient's history of a \"horrible\" flu-like episode two months ago is not suggestive of any of these other causes."
