Atorvastatin and cholestyramine are medications used to treat high cholesterol by reducing LDL-cholesterol levels in the blood. This is achieved through an increased expression of LDL receptors in the liver, so the correct answer is (B). Increased lipoprotein lipase activity is seen with fibric acid derivatives, increased hepatic bile salt synthesis is seen with cholestyramine, and decreased hepatic de novo cholesterol synthesis is seen with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as atorvastatin."

Atorvastatin inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis, while cholestyramine binds to bile acids in the intestine, inhibiting their reabsorption and increasing their excretion. Both mechanisms increase LDL receptor expression on hepatocytes, leading to increased clearance of LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) increased LDL receptor expression."

Atorvastatin is a statin that works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis in the liver. This leads to increased expression of LDL receptors on cell membranes, allowing for increased uptake and clearance of LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. Cholestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant, which binds to bile acids in the intestines and prevents their reabsorption. This leads to increased synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol in the liver, effectively lowering serum LDL cholesterol. Therefore, the most likely change induced by both agents is increased LDL receptor expression."
