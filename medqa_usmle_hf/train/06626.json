The patient\u2019s symptoms and family history suggest hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is confirmed by echocardiogram showing systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Mitral regurgitation is commonly seen in HCM due to the subaortic obstruction. Systolic ejection murmur that radiates to the carotids might be seen in aortic stenosis, but it is not consistent with HCM. Tricuspid regurgitation is not commonly associated with HCM. Systolic ejection murmur that improves with the Valsalva maneuver is a classic finding in aortic stenosis."

The most common physical exam finding in HCM patients is a systolic ejection murmur that is best heard at the apex and increases with standing, Valsalva maneuver, or exercise. However, in this case, the patient has systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, which causes mitral regurgitation, so (C) is the correct answer."
