These agents can damage the DNA of both normal and cancerous cells, resulting in side effects including blood and urinary toxicity. Platinum-based DNA intercalators may also cause similar side effects, but they are not typically associated with the specific cytotoxic metabolite mentioned in the question.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A)."
