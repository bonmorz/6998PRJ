Patient 1 has a significant family history of breast and ovarian cancer, which raises suspicion for a hereditary predisposition.

However, given her concern and family history of breast cancer, a breast ultrasound is the best next step in management to assess the mass. Mammography is not indicated for a patient in her 20s with a benign breast mass, and CA-125 testing is not recommended for screening or diagnosis of breast cancer."
