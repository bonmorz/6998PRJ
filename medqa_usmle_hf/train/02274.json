The symptoms and physical examination findings suggest congestive heart failure, with a possibility of a congenital heart defect that is causing the two murmurs. Congestive heart failure can lead to decreased oxygenation of tissues and, in response, the body may produce more red blood cells, leading to polycythemia. Secondary hypertension, thrombocytosis, and myocardial ischemia are not direct consequences of congestive heart failure."

Polycythemia can occur as a compensatory mechanism to improve oxygen delivery to tissues in case of hypoxia caused by pulmonary hypertension. Secondary hypertension is not a typical complication of VSD. Thrombocytosis and myocardial ischemia are not directly related to VSD."
