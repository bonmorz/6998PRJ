The patient has multiple comorbidities and risk factors, including a history of venous clot, COPD, and overweight, which increase the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, abdominal ultrasonography should be recommended to screen for these conditions. Pulmonary function testing may also be useful, but the patient's current symptoms do not suggest that it is an urgent issue. CT scan of the chest may be useful to screen for lung cancer, but the patient's smoking history is remote, and his lung sounds do not indicate that it is an urgent concern. Bone densitometry scan is not indicated at this time."
