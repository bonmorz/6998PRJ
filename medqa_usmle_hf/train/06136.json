To calculate cardiac output using the Fick principle, we need to know the arterial and venous oxygen contents, as well as the oxygen consumption. However, in this case, we are given para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) clearance (renal blood flow), urinary flow rate, urinary concentration of PAH, and hematocrit. By using the formula for renal blood flow (RBF = Urine concentration of PAH * Urine flow rate / Plasma concentration of PAH), we can calculate the renal blood flow to be 75 mL/min. Since RBF is approximately 20% of cardiac output, we can estimate cardiac output to be approximately 6 L/min (75 mL/min / 0.2). Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."

We can calculate RPF by multiplying the urinary flow rate by the urinary concentration of PAH (1.5 x 8 = 12), and we know that the plasma concentration of PAH is 0.02 mg/ml. Therefore, RPF = (12 x 0.02) / 0.5 = 0.48 L/min. Substituting these values into the formula for cardiac output gives CO = 0.48 / (1 - 0.5) = 0.96 L/min. However, this value is only for the administration of the placebo. We need to repeat the experiment with the antihypertensive drugs to see their effect on cardiac output. Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct."

First, we need to use the formula: RPF (renal plasma flow) = U_PAH x V / P_PAH, where U_PAH is the urinary concentration of PAH, V is the urinary flow rate, and P_PAH is the plasma concentration of PAH. Using the values given in the question, we get RPF = 225 ml/min. Next, we use the Fick principle formula: cardiac output = RPF / (1 - hematocrit), where hematocrit is expressed as a decimal. Plug in the values and we get cardiac output = 4.5 L/min. However, this value represents renal blood flow, not cardiac output. To estimate cardiac output, we assume that renal blood flow is approximately 20% of cardiac output. Therefore, cardiac output = renal blood flow / 0.2 = 4.5 L/min / 0.2 = 6 L/min.

To estimate cardiac output using the Fick principle, we need to know the oxygen consumption, arterial and venous oxygen concentration, and hematocrit. However, this information is not provided in the question. Instead, we are given information about the urinary flow rate and concentration of PAH, which can be used to estimate renal blood flow using the clearance method. The amount of PAH cleared per minute is equal to the renal plasma flow (RPF), which can be calculated as follows: \n\nRPF = (Urine flow rate) x (Urine concentration of PAH) / (Plasma concentration of PAH)\n\nRPF = (1.5 ml/min) x (8 mg/ml) / (0.02 mg/ml) = 600 ml/min\n\nAssuming that renal blood flow accounts for 20% of cardiac output, the estimated cardiac output would be:\n\nCardiac output = RPF / 0.2 = 3000 ml/min = 3 L/min\n\nHowever, since the options given differ significantly from this value, we look for alternative methods to estimate cardiac output. One such method is the thermodilution technique, which involves injecting a known amount of cold saline into the right atrium and measuring the resulting decrease in blood temperature using a thermistor-tipped catheter. However, this method is invasive and not practical for this study. Another method is to use non-invasive techniques such as echocardiography, which can provide an estimate of stroke volume and heart rate, which can then be used to calculate cardiac output. However, this information is also not provided in the question. Therefore, the best estimation of cardiac output would be to assume a normal resting cardiac output of 5-6 L/min for a healthy adult male and choose option (B) as the closest value."

Plugging in the values given, we get a renal blood flow of 660 ml/min. Since renal blood flow constitutes about 20% of cardiac output, we can estimate cardiac output to be about 3,300 ml/min or 3.3 L/min. Option (B) is closest to this value, so it is the best answer."

To estimate cardiac output, we can use the Fick principle: CO = (rate of O2 consumption) / (arterial O2 content - venous O2 content). Since the patient is healthy and given a placebo, we can assume his rate of O2 consumption is average at 250 ml/min. We can estimate his cardiac output by measuring his renal blood flow, which is equal to his effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) since PAH is freely filtered and secreted by the kidneys. ERPF = (urine flow rate x urinary PAH concentration) / (plasma PAH concentration x 1 - hematocrit). Plugging in the numbers, we get ERPF = (1.5 x 8) / (0.02 x 0.5) = 2400 ml/min. Since renal blood flow is 20% of cardiac output, we can estimate cardiac output as CO = ERPF / 0.2 = 2400 / 0.2 = 12 L/min. However, this value is for the patient on the PAH infusion. Since the question asks for the best estimate of cardiac output for the healthy volunteer, we can assume that his renal blood flow represents 20% of his cardiac output as well. Therefore, his cardiac output would be 6 L/min."
