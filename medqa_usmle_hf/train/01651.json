The patient has a history of tibial osteosarcoma lesion with pulmonary metastases, which suggests the possibility of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The loud P2 on exam also supports this diagnosis. Right ventricular hypertrophy and a dilated pulmonary artery are both typical findings in patients with PAH, so the correct answer is (D). Biventricular dilatation with a decreased ejection fraction may be seen in dilated cardiomyopathy. Left atrial dilatation with mitral valve stenosis is seen in mitral stenosis, and left ventricular dilatation with an incompetent aortic valve is seen in aortic regurgitation. However, the symptoms and history do not point to these diagnoses."
