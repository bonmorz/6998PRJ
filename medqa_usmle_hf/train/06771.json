The patient's symptoms of unprovoked palpitations, feelings of dread and lightheadedness suggest panic disorder, which can lead to avoidance behaviors such as sitting towards the back of lecture halls to \"quickly escape and not make a scene.\" Specific phobia and social phobia involve fear and avoidance of specific objects or situations, respectively. Somatic symptom disorder involves preoccupation with physical symptoms despite no underlying medical cause, which is not the case here."
