The bias in this example is attrition bias, also known as dropout bias or loss to follow-up bias. This occurs when participants drop out of a study, leading to a loss of data and potentially biasing the results. In this case, the heaviest and most committed smokers, who were less likely to quit, dropped out of the study, leading to a biased sample of participants who were more interested in quitting. This bias can invalidate the conclusions drawn from the study."
