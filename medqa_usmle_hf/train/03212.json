The patient\u2019s symptoms have been extensively evaluated and have not received a specific diagnosis despite diagnostic testing and various treatments. He has stopped attending social events and spends most of his time trying to find a diagnosis, which is indicative of somatic symptom disorder. The patient\u2019s depressed mood and constricted affect suggest that he may also have an underlying mental health condition, but this is not the primary cause of his symptoms. Malingering is not likely because the patient is actively seeking medical help and is affected by his symptoms. Atypical depression and adjustment disorder do not fit with all the patient\u2019s symptoms."

The patient\u2019s behavior of spending most of his time at the library trying to learn what could be causing his symptoms supports this diagnosis. Atypical depression and adjustment disorder do not fit the symptom presentation, and malingering implies a conscious effort to deceive others and gain secondary gain, which is not evident in this scenario."

The patient has been evaluated by several urologists and extensive diagnostic testing has not revealed a specific diagnosis, leading to increased anxiety and disruptive symptoms. This patient's presentation is consistent with somatic symptom disorder, in which individuals become overly concerned with physical symptoms, leading to excessive health-related behaviors and anxiety. Malingering is not likely as the patient's symptoms have been ongoing for three years, and atypical depression and adjustment disorder do not fully explain the patient's somatic symptoms."
