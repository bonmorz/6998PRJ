The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest an injury to the distal ulnar nerve which innervates the palmar medial 2 digits and controls the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle, causing hyperextension of the 4th and 5th fingers at the MCP joints and flexion at the IP joints. The distal median nerve controls the thenar eminence muscles and sensation to the palmar aspect of the thumb, index, and middle finger. The proximal ulnar nerve controls the flexor digitorum profundus muscle to the 4th and 5th digits and the ulnar half of the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle. The recurrent branch of the median nerve controls the thenar muscles but does not innervate the palmar medial 2 digits as affected in this patient."

Given the location of the numbness and the hyperextension of the 4th and 5th fingers, the most likely affected nerve is the distal ulnar nerve. The median nerve does not innervate these fingers, and the ulnar nerve is responsible for sensation and movement in this area. The location of the tenderness and injury is also consistent with ulnar nerve damage."

The patient's symptoms suggest damage to the distal ulnar nerve, which travels along the medial aspect of the hand and supplies sensation to the palmar medial 2 digits. The hyperextension of the 4th and 5th fingers at the MCP joints and flexion at the IP joints suggest weakness of the interossei and lumbrical muscles, which are supplied by the ulnar nerve. Damage to the distal median nerve would result in sensory loss in the lateral 3.5 digits, not just the lateral 3 digits. The recurrent branch of the median nerve supplies the thenar muscles and is not likely to be affected by the injury."
