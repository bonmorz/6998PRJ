The fact that he later develops constipation and headaches suggests that he was likely treated with a medication that blocks 5-HT3 receptors, such as a 5-HT3 antagonist. These medications are often used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Cannabinoid receptor agonists can also be used for this purpose, but they are less commonly used than 5-HT3 antagonists.
