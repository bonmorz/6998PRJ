The Swiss-cheese model suggests that medical errors are caused by a combination of factors, and the errors occur when failures align. In this case, the failure to implement the preincision \u2018time-out\u2019 and compliance monitoring protocol, along with the senior orthopedic resident's incorrect notes, led to the surgical error. The hospital system and surgical team are held accountable for this error, which is in line with the Swiss-cheese model's focus on systemic solutions rather than individual blame. Closed-loop communication, root cause analysis, and sentinel events are all related concepts but do not describe the approach taken in this scenario."

The Swiss-cheese model of accident causation is a model used in risk analysis and risk management of accidents, suggesting that there are several layers of defense against hazards, but there are holes in each layer. The failure of one point of defense does not necessarily lead to an accident, but usually leads to either the next layer of defense being activated or to the risky activity being abandoned. In this case, the mandatory protocol of preincision \u2018time-out\u2019 and compliance monitoring was a layer of defense that was not implemented, leading to the medical error. Therefore, the Swiss-cheese model describes the approach to prevent medical errors in this case."
