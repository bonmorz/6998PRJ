The symptoms described by the patient suggest a possible diagnosis of vaginismus which is characterized by involuntary contraction of the pelvic floor muscles during penetration. Pelvic floor physical therapy is the best next step in management as it aims to improve the strength and function of the pelvic floor muscles, which can help alleviate the pain during intercourse. The other options are not appropriate for this condition. Botox is not indicated and sex psychotherapy and vaginal estrogen cream are not appropriate for this type of pain."

The symptoms and lack of abnormal findings suggest that the patient may be experiencing vaginismus or pelvic floor muscle spasm. Pelvic floor physical therapy can help address these muscle spasms and improve sexual function. Vaginal Botox injections may be an option in some cases, but it is not the first-line treatment for this condition. Sex psychotherapy may be helpful if there are other psychological factors contributing to the pain, but it is not likely to be effective if the underlying cause is related to muscle spasms. Vaginal estrogen cream is not indicated in this case as there is no evidence of hormonal issues contributing to the pain."
