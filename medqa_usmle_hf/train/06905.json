The patient's recent travel history and development of a painful red rash on his leg suggest a probable bacterial infection treated with antibiotics in Mexico. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a commonly used antibiotic for bacterial infections and can increase the effect of warfarin leading to an increased INR. Rifampin and phenobarbital can both induce the cytochrome P450 system, leading to decreased warfarin levels and lower INR. Griseofulvin is an antifungal medication and is therefore not likely to be the correct answer in this case."
