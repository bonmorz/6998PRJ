The subluxation of lenses, high-arched palate, kyphosis, and increased serum concentration of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate all suggest a diagnosis of homocystinuria. In this condition, there is a deficiency of cystathionine synthase, leading to accumulation of homocysteine and decreased methionine concentration. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient's serum is a decreased methionine concentration."
