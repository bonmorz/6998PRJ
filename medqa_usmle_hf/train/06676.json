Patients with Marfan syndrome are at high risk of aortic dissection, a potentially life-threatening condition where the aorta tears due to weakness in the walls. Infertility and intravascular thrombosis are not commonly associated with Marfan syndrome, and while rupture is a possibility with any weakened blood vessel, aortic dissection is a more specific risk in this case."
