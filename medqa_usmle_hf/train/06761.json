The symptoms, especially the improvement with sitting down, and the late systolic ejection murmur suggest aortic stenosis.

Inflammatory constriction of the bronchioles is a possible cause of asthma, but there are no wheezing or coughing symptoms presented. Narrowing of the coronary arterial lumen and cellular injury of the esophageal epithelium are not related to the presented symptoms."
