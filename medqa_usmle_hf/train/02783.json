The patient's symptoms are consistent with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones and susceptibility to fractures. OI is most commonly caused by a defect in type 1 collagen, which is responsible for bone and tooth formation. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a type 1 collagen defect. Types 3 and 4 collagen defects are associated with other connective tissue disorders, and type 2 collagen defects are associated with skeletal dysplasias, but none of these are consistent with the patient's presentation."
