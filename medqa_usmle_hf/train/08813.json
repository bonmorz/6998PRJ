The patient's history of prolonged nosebleeds and bruising/bleeding after minor injuries, along with abnormal bleeding and clotting labs, suggest a bleeding disorder. The increased PTT suggested a deficiency in the intrinsic pathway, which is most commonly associated with deficiencies in factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII. However, since the patient responded to desmopressin, which releases stored factor VIII, it is most likely that the patient has decreased levels of factor VIII. Factors IX, XI, and XII deficiencies are typically treated with fresh frozen plasma or specific factor replacement therapy. ADAMTS13 deficiency is associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which is characterized by decreased platelet count and the presence of small clots in small blood vessels. Decreased plasma fibrinogen is associated with afibrinogenemia or hypofibrinogenemia, which are rare bleeding disorders characterized by low levels or complete absence of fibrinogen."
