Administration of magnesium sulfate and betamethasone is appropriate to decrease the risk of neonatal neurologic injury and respiratory distress syndrome. Option B (Oxytocin + Magnesium sulfate) is incorrect because oxytocin would only be used in the active phase of labor, not in preterm labor. Option C (Progesterone + Terbutaline) is incorrect because progesterone would only be used to prevent preterm labor, not to treat it, and terbutaline has been associated with serious maternal and fetal adverse effects. Option D (Terbutaline + Oxytocin) is also incorrect because terbutaline should not be used with oxytocin due to an increased risk of maternal and fetal adverse effects."
