The sudden onset of spinning sensations, imbalance, and ringing in the left ear suggest a peripheral vestibular disorder. The left-sided hearing loss supports this diagnosis. The upper respiratory infection and erythromycin treatment suggest a possible viral labyrinthitis or ototoxicity as the cause. The most appropriate initial step in management is to reduce caffeine intake, as caffeine intake can stimulate the vestibular system and exacerbate symptoms. Topiramate and fluoxetine are not appropriate for treatment of vestibular disorders. The Epley maneuver is used to treat benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, which is not consistent with the patient\u2019s history."
