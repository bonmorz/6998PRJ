Starting from the beginning of the sequence, we can use a codon chart to determine that the first three bases (GCA) code for alanine. Moving along the sequence, we can continue to use the codon chart to determine that the last codon in the sequence (UAU) codes for tyrosine. The anticodon for the tRNA that carries tyrosine is complementary to the codon, so it will have the same bases but in the opposite order.

Using the genetic code, we can see that the codon for UAU (the last codon in the mRNA sequence) codes for the amino acid tyrosine. The tRNA anticodon for tyrosine is 3' UAC 5'. However, the question asks for the anticodon for the last amino acid translated in the chain, which is the first amino acid in the mRNA sequence. Since translation starts at the first base, the last amino acid translated would be the one encoded by the last codon in the mRNA sequence (UAU).
