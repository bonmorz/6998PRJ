Alzheimer disease is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's age, progressive memory loss, and other cognitive deficits. Normal pressure hydrocephalus can also cause cognitive impairment but usually presents with gait disturbances and urinary incontinence. Frontotemporal dementia can also present with language and behavioral changes, but these patients typically have preservation of memory in the early stages. Creutzfeld-Jakob disease has a more rapid progression and can present with myoclonus and rapidly progressive dementia."

While normal pressure hydrocephalus can present with similar symptoms, it typically has additional symptoms such as urinary incontinence and gait disturbances. Frontotemporal dementia would typically present with more behavioral changes and personality changes rather than memory deficits. Creutzfeld-Jakob disease would present with more rapid progression and symptoms such as tremors and muscle stiffness. The clock drawing test, which is impaired in this patient, is often used as a screening tool for cognitive impairment and dementia."
