The patient\u2019s history and physical examination suggest the diagnosis of lymphedema possibly caused by breast cancer treatment. Non-surgical treatments such as limb elevation, exercise, and static compression bandaging can be tried first but if these fail, the next best step is vascularized lymph node transfer, which can help restore lymphatic drainage. Diethylcarbamazine is used for filariasis, not for lymphedema. Endovascular stenting is not indicated for lymphedema. Antibiotics may be used if there is an accompanying infection, but it is not indicated for primary lymphedema."

The patient has lymphedema, which is a swelling due to accumulation of lymphatic fluid, and is common after axillary lymph node dissection for breast cancer. Non-pharmacologic treatments like limb elevation, exercise, and compression bandaging can be started initially. If there is no improvement, surgical options can be considered. Vascularized lymph node transfer is the best next step as it involves transferring lymph nodes from another part of the body to the affected area to restore lymphatic flow. Diethylcarbamazine is used for filarial infections that cause lymphatic obstruction, which is not the case here. Endovascular stenting is used for arterial occlusion, not lymphedema.
