The patient\u2019s symptoms of chest pain, racing pulse, dizziness, and difficulty breathing suggest episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The absence of P waves on ECG recordings during episodes suggests paroxysmal SVT. Among the options, AV node with slow and fast pathway is the most likely underlying cause of this condition, as it is the most common form of paroxysmal SVT. Pre-excitation of ventricles is associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, which would show delta waves on ECG. Fibrosis of the sinoatrial node and surrounding myocardium is associated with sick sinus syndrome, which would present with bradycardia or sinus pauses, not tachycardia. Mutations in genes that code for myocyte ion channels are associated with long QT syndrome, which presents with arrhythmias triggered by exercise or emotional stress, but not necessarily with SVT."

The symptoms are consistent with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), and the absence of P waves on ECG suggests an atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) or atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). AVNRT occurs due to two distinct pathways in the AV node, a slow and a fast pathway, resulting in re-entry tachycardia. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is AV node with slow and fast pathway."
