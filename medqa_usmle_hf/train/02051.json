Classical conditioning involves the association of a neutral stimulus (the audio clip) with a meaningful stimulus (the tangerine), resulting in an elevated response in the brain regions associated with reward and reinforcement (ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra). This is the most likely explanation for the fMRI findings in this scenario. Positive reinforcement would involve the presentation of a reward immediately following the desired behavior, which is also present in this scenario. Displacement and extinction are not relevant to this scenario."

The repetitive stimulus (solving the puzzle, hearing the audio clip, and receiving the tangerine) led to classical conditioning, in which the chimpanzee's brain associated the sound of the pop song with the reward of the tangerine, leading to elevated neurotransmission in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra. Positive reinforcement involves rewarding desired behavior to increase its frequency, while displacement refers to transferring emotions from one object or situation to another. Extinction involves the gradual disappearance of a response when the conditioned stimulus is presented without the rewarding stimulus."

The scenario describes a classical conditioning of the chimpanzee\u2019s brain where the pop song serves as a conditioned stimulus that leads to the release of dopamine in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, which then reinforces the behavior of solving the puzzle. This is best explained by option C, classical conditioning."

The fMRI shows elevated neurotransmission in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, which are associated with reward and reinforcement. This is a classic example of classical conditioning, where a positive stimulus (the pop song) is associated with a reward (the tangerine) to reinforce a particular behavior (solving the puzzle).

This scenario is an example of classical conditioning, where the audio clip and the delivery of the tangerine act as conditioned and unconditioned stimuli, respectively, resulting in elevated neurotransmission in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, which are involved in the brain's reward system. Positive reinforcement involves a reward being given after a desired behavior is exhibited, while extinction is the gradual disappearance of a conditioned response when the conditioned stimulus is repeated without the unconditioned stimulus. Displacement is a psychological defense mechanism wherein an individual redirects negative feelings or impulses from one target to a less threatening or more socially acceptable target."
