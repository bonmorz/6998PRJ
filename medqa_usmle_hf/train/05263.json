The patient\u2019s past medical history of diabetes, anemia, and congestive heart failure may contribute to developing esophagitis, which is inflammation of the esophageal lining. The absence of ST elevation on ECG and pending troponin results suggest myocardial infarction is less likely. Esophageal rupture is an emergency condition with severe symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, and tachycardia. However, the patient\u2019s stable vital signs and absence of those severe symptoms make this diagnosis unlikely. Pulmonary embolism usually presents with sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and tachycardia, which are not reported by the patient."
