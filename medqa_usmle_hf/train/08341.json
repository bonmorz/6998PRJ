The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest dysphagia, which can be caused by any obstruction or constriction in the esophagus or upper gastrointestinal tract. Barium swallow with video fluoroscopy is the best diagnostic study as it allows visualization of the esophagus during swallowing. Cervical MRI is not useful for diagnosing dysphagia. Chest X-ray is not helpful as it does not provide any information on the esophagus. Upper gastrointestinal series may be useful but barium swallow with video fluoroscopy is the preferred initial study."
