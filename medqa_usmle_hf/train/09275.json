The test that the pediatrician is referring to is the Methacholine challenge test, which is used to diagnose bronchial hyperresponsiveness, a characteristic feature of asthma. The test involves inhalation of increasing doses of methacholine, which causes tightening of airways in individuals with asthma. If the patient does not have a significant response to the test, it would suggest that asthma is not the underlying cause of the respiratory symptoms. CT scans and chest radiographs are not typically used to diagnose asthma, and allergy testing may be used to identify potential triggers but does not definitively diagnose asthma."
