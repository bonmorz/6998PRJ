The symptoms and the patient's history suggest Hirschsprung's disease, which is caused by a missing neural crest layer in the submucosa of the colon. This layer contains the nerve cells that signal when the colon should contract to move stool along. Without this layer, stool can become stuck, causing constipation and distension of the colon. A biopsy would reveal the absence of nerve cells in this layer."
