The patient's symptoms suggest esophageal cancer, and the esophagogastroduodenoscopy confirms the presence of an exophytic mass with ulcerations and mucous plugs. Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of esophageal cancer in Western countries and is often found in the lower third of the esophagus. Squamous cell carcinoma may also occur in the esophagus, but it tends to be more common in areas of the world where there is a high rate of smoking and alcohol consumption. Achalasia is a disorder of the esophagus that impairs the ability of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax, causing difficulty swallowing. Gastric ulcers would not typically cause symptoms that are specific to the esophagus. The patient's unintentional weight loss may be explained by the tumor's effect on his appetite or metabolism."
