The low blood pressure, tachycardia, and cool, pale skin suggest hypovolemia. The body\u2019s response to hypovolemia is to increase peripheral vascular resistance, so the correct answer is (B). The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is not increased in hypovolemic shock, and there is an initial decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit concentration due to blood loss."
