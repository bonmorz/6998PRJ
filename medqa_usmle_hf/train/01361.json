The sudden leakage of clear fluid from the vagina, along with chronic hypertension and missed prenatal appointments, suggests preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).

Sexual intercourse in the third trimester is a risk factor for PPROM, but it is not the cause in this case. \u03b2-blocker use and alcohol use are not related to PPROM."
