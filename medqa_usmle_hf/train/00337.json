The carpopedal spasm suggests hypocalcemia, which is a side effect of certain medications that can induce P450 enzymes in the liver, leading to increased metabolism of vitamin D and calcium. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. Elevated blood levels of a medication (option A) or sub-therapeutic dose (option D) could potentially cause a seizure, but would not explain the carpopedal spasm. Increased water consumption (option B) would not affect calcium levels."
