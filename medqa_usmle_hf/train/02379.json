The most appropriate step is to wrap the finger tip in gauze damp with saline and place it in a sealed plastic bag on ice water. Cooling preserves the viability of the amputated tissue until it can be surgically reattached. Preserving the finger tip in saline rather than water is preferable as it helps to maintain the tissue pH and reduces the chance of bacterial growth. Warming is not recommended as it can accelerate tissue breakdown. Iodine can damage the tissue and should not be used."

The proper way to preserve a finger tip after amputation is to wrap it in gauze damp with saline and place it in a sealed plastic bag on ice water. Option A is incorrect because iodine should not be used on an amputated body part as it can cause further tissue damage. Option B is incorrect because cooled saline can cause tissue damage and delay reattachment of the finger tip. Option C is incorrect because warm saline can increase bacterial growth and deteriorate the tissue."

The amputated finger should be wrapped in gauze damp with normal saline, placed in a sealed plastic bag, and then placed on ice water. This helps reduce bleeding and can help preserve the finger tip until it can be surgically reattached. Iodine and cold saline water can damage the tissue further, while warm saline water can promote bacterial growth."
