The best course of action would be to request one of the formal interpreters from the clinic, as they are trained to provide accurate and unbiased translation.

Attempting to communicate using the physician's basic Spanish may also lead to miscommunication and potential harm to the patient. Converse with the patient in English may further limit communication and understanding. Suggesting that the patient finds a Spanish speaking physician may not be feasible or practical, and can be seen as discriminatory."

The physician has a responsibility to ensure effective communication with the patient, and the use of a professional medical interpreter is the best option to ensure accurate communication and avoid misinterpretations or misunderstandings. The physician should request one of the formal interpreters available at the clinic. Relying on the patient's family member to translate can cause confidentiality issues, as well as potential inaccuracies due to family dynamics or cultural differences. Attempting to communicate using the physician's basic Spanish or conversing in English with the patient may lead to misunderstandings or errors in communication, which can negatively affect the patient's health outcomes. Suggesting that the patient finds a Spanish-speaking physician is not a practical solution and may create barriers to access to care for the patient."
