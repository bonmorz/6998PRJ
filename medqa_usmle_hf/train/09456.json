Epinephrine is a sympathomimetic agent that stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, which results in increased insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cells. Phenoxybenzamine is an alpha blocker that can block the action of epinephrine on the alpha receptors, but it does not affect the action on beta receptors. Therefore, the most likely effect to be observed is increased insulin secretion. The other options are not related to the actions of epinephrine or phenoxybenzamine."

Increased insulin secretion is also a known effect of the sympathetic nervous system, and blocking its effects with phenoxybenzamine would lead to increased insulin secretion.

Decreased breakdown of muscle glycogen is not likely to occur due to epinephrine infusion, and the other options are not related to the autonomic nervous system."
