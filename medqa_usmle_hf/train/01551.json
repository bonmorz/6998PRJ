A positive dipstick test for protein in an asymptomatic individual should be confirmed with a repeat test on a separate occasion to rule out transient causes such as exercise or fever. If both tests are positive, further evaluation with a spot urine-protein-to-creatinine ratio, renal ultrasound, and referral to a nephrologist may be necessary. Urine culture is not necessary unless there are additional signs of infection or inflammation."

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends repeating a positive protein dipstick on a separate occasion before proceeding with further evaluation for possible renal disease. This is because transient proteinuria may occur due to various factors such as exercise, fever, or dehydration, and may not indicate persistent renal disease. If the repeat test is positive, then further evaluation may be necessary."
