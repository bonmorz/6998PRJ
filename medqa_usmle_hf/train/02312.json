Among the options, Buspirone is the most appropriate drug for treating anxiety disorders. Escitalopram is also an option but may cause sexual dysfunction, which the patient has reported. Clonazepam carries a risk of dependence and should only be used short-term. Amitriptyline is primarily used for depression and neuropathic pain, which are not the primary concerns in this patient."

Escitalopram and Amitriptyline are also used to treat anxiety disorders, but they have side effects such as drowsiness, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that can cause tolerance and dependence if used for a long time."
