Since the family is Jehovah's witnesses and it is documented that they would not want a transfusion, it is important to respect their wishes. However, the situation is different for the boy and mother as the boy may have a better prognosis if transfused early. It is best to prioritize the boy's care and respect the mother's wishes by not transfusing her, but transfusing the boy if it is deemed necessary for his survival. Consultation with the hospital ethics committee may be necessary to ensure that all legal and ethical considerations are taken into account."

However, the boy's life should be prioritized since he was the ejected passenger in a motor vehicle collision and may require a transfusion to survive. As the father is the official healthcare proxy, he confirms that the family does not want a transfusion in an acute situation, but it is reasonable to offer transfusion to the boy since his life is in danger. The mother's situation is unclear, and resuscitation efforts may be able to continue without a transfusion. Therefore, the best next step in management is to not transfuse the mother and transfuse the boy if necessary."

Consulting the ethics committee may be necessary for further guidance, but the immediate priority is to follow the family's wishes and provide life-saving treatment while respecting their beliefs.
