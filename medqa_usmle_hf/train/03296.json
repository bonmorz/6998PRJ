The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein also indicate inflammation. Methotrexate is a commonly prescribed medication for rheumatoid arthritis as it helps reduce inflammation and slow joint damage. Ibuprofen may provide relief for the pain but won't slow the progression of the disease. Hydroxychloroquine and infliximab are also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis but are typically used as second-line therapies after methotrexate or if methotrexate is not effective."

The patient presents with symptoms of joint pain and morning stiffness, swollen and tender joints, and reduced hand strength, which are characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis. Laboratory findings show elevated inflammatory markers and presence of anti-citrullinated protein antibody, indicating the need for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Among the options, methotrexate is a commonly used DMARD in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, while ibuprofen provides only symptomatic relief. Hydroxychloroquine and infliximab are usually used as second or third-line therapies for more severe disease. So, the most appropriate treatment for this patient is methotrexate."
