The patient has a history of miscarriages, joint pain and swelling, and an erythematous rash suggests systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

The hematuria indicates renal involvement, and the minocycline usage may be a trigger for drug-induced lupus. Low levels of C3 and C4 complement are characteristic findings in SLE. A positive result for anti-dsDNA antibodies is more specific for SLE, but option (D) is not a valid option."

Cytotoxic glomerular antibodies are seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, which is not consistent with the hematuria in this case.

The presence of arthritis in SLE is not typically associated with erosions on X-ray, but joint pain and swelling are common. The presence of anti-histone antibodies is suggestive of drug-induced lupus, which is less likely in this case since the patient is only taking minocycline for acne vulgaris. The presence of cytotoxic glomerular antibodies is suggestive of Goodpasture syndrome which is not likely in this case since there is no lung involvement. The most likely finding in SLE is low serum levels of C3 and C4 which are complement proteins that are typically decreased in SLE."
