Normal postpartum fever usually resolves within 24 hours and does not persist for 4 days, and there are no symptoms indicating chorioamnionitis."

The patient's symptoms, including the malodorous lochia, breast engorgement and tenderness, and erythema and tenderness around the incision, suggest endometritis, an infection of the uterine lining. Pyelonephritis presents with flank pain, and the absence of shortness of breath or chest pain rules out pulmonary embolus. The presence of foul-smelling lochia and uterine tenderness suggest endometritis rather than normal postpartum fever, which typically resolves within 24-48 hours. Chorioamnionitis is possible but less likely given the timing of the fever and the lack of significant findings on pelvic exam."

The patient has had prolonged labor and underwent cesarean delivery with intrapartum penicillin, both of which put her at risk for endometritis.

Pyelonephritis and normal postpartum fever are less likely causes given the specific symptoms the patient presents with. Chorioamnionitis is a possibility, but the lack of fetal membranes and the presence of a dry incision make endometritis a more likely explanation."
