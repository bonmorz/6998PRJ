Options B and C are used to control acute variceal bleeding, but balloon tamponade has higher complications and is less effective. Option A is for long-term management of variceal bleeding. Option D is for refractory cases or in patients who cannot undergo endoscopy. Therefore, the best initial management for this patient would be combined vasoactive and endoscopic therapy."
