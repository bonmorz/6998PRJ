The medication that is also used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension is likely a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor, such as sildenafil (Viagra). These medications increase cGMP levels by inhibiting its breakdown, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow, ultimately leading to improved erectile function. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) decrease cGMP degradation."

PDE5 inhibitors work by inhibiting the breakdown of cGMP, leading to increased blood flow to the penis and improved erectile function. Thus, the correct answer is (D) decrease cGMP degradation. Option (A) is incorrect as cAMP is not directly involved in the mechanism of action of PDE5 inhibitors.

Option (C) is also incorrect as PDE5 inhibitors actually work to decrease cGMP degradation."
