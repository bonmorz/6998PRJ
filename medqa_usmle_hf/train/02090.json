Lamivudine and zidovudine are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, which can cause hematologic toxicity, while indinavir is a protease inhibitor that can cause hyperbilirubinemia and nephrolithiasis. Pancreatitis can be a possible adverse effect of didanosine or stavudine. Hyperpigmentation of palms and soles is seen in Addison's disease or in patients taking photosensitive drugs."
