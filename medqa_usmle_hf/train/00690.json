The patient's symptoms suggest an androgen excess, which can be caused by multiple conditions, but the fact that she broke her wrist after a minor trauma and has a spinal compression fracture suggests decreased bone mineral density, which is a symptom of aromatase deficiency. The pelvic ultrasound showing multiple ovarian cysts is also a hallmark symptom of polycystic ovary syndrome, but the patient's bone issues make aromatase deficiency a more likely diagnosis. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia and Turner syndrome would have different physical exam findings and/or laboratory values."
