Option (A) is a high proteinuria level, which is a sign of severe preeclampsia but is not a feature that would make the suspected diagnosis into a more severe form. Option (C) indicates a low platelet count, which is another sign of severe preeclampsia but is not a feature that would make the suspected diagnosis into a more severe form.

Option D suggests renal dysfunction, which can be a sign of severe preeclampsia, but the serum creatinine level is within the normal range. Option B, however, indicates a persistent elevation in blood pressure, which is a sign of worsening preeclampsia and requires immediate intervention."
