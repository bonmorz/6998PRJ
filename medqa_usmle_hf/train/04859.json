Once the cardiac membrane is stabilized, further management can proceed, including ordering a stat serum potassium level, administering regular insulin and 50% dextrose in water, and/or administering IV sodium bicarbonate if necessary."

The patient's ECG shows characteristic changes of hyperkalemia (peaked T waves, widened QRS complex), making option (B) seem like a plausible answer. However, given the patient's history of CKD and diabetes, it's unlikely that she would suddenly develop severe hyperkalemia without any prior warning signs. Additionally, her symptoms of symmetric muscle weakness suggest the possibility of hypokalemia as well. Therefore, the best initial step would be to administer IV calcium gluconate, which can help stabilize the cardiac membrane and prevent arrhythmias caused by hyperkalemia. Potassium levels and other electrolytes can be checked and managed once the patient is stabilized. Administering regular insulin and 50% dextrose in water (option C) can also help shift potassium back into cells, but it may take too long to have an effect in this acute setting. IV sodium bicarbonate (option D) can help correct acidosis caused by hyperkalemia, but it is not the initial treatment of choice."

IV sodium bicarbonate may help treat acidosis, which can exacerbate hyperkalemia, but is not the first-line treatment for hyperkalemia."
