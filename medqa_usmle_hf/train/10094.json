Thus, no further renal tests are required at this time. The patient may need further management of her chronic kidney disease, such as adjusting her medications and monitoring her renal function."

The patient\u2019s laboratory results and symptoms are suggestive of diabetes mellitus, which can cause diabetic nephropathy. The urine specific gravity of 1.070 suggests concentrated urine, which could be due to the patient\u2019s increased water intake. The urinary glucose (+++) also suggests hyperglycemia, and the (+ +) protein in the urine and eGFR of 60 indicate early kidney damage. Renal arteriography is not indicated as there is no evidence of renal artery stenosis. Urine protein electrophoresis is used for specific types of proteinuria, which is not indicated in this case. Renal computed tomography is not indicated as the patient already had a bedside renal ultrasound to identify any structural abnormalities. Therefore, no further renal tests are required at this time, but further management of the patient\u2019s diabetes and diabetic nephropathy should be initiated."

There is no apparent indication for renal arteriography or urine protein electrophoresis. Renal computed tomography is usually not the first test ordered in cases of chronic kidney disease.
