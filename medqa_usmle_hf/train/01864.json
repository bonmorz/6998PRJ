The patient\u2019s low BMI, dry skin, brittle nails, calluses on knuckles, and laboratory results all point to Bulimia nervosa.

The weight loss, dry skin, brittle nails, and calluses on the knuckles suggest malnutrition. The laboratory findings show low potassium levels, which can be caused by self-induced vomiting in bulimia nervosa. Milk-alkali syndrome is unlikely as the patient does not have a history of excessive calcium or antacid intake. Major depressive disorder may be a contributing factor but is not the primary diagnosis. Anorexia nervosa is also a possible diagnosis, but the patient's BMI is within the normal range."
