However, before starting any therapy, it is important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be causing or exacerbating the symptoms. TSH is ordered as an abnormal thyroid function can also cause symptoms similar to mania. \u03b2-hCG is checked to rule out pregnancy, which can also cause behavioral changes, and serum creatinine concentration is ordered to rule out any renal dysfunction that can cause behavior changes. CBC and liver function tests along with other lab tests may be helpful in assessing the overall health of the patient but do not specifically aid in diagnosing or ruling out bipolar disorder. Assessing for suicidal ideation and obtaining echocardiography are important steps in the management of psychiatric patients, but they are not the initial step in this scenario. BMI, HbA1c, lipid levels, and prolactin levels may also be helpful in assessing the overall health of the patient but do not specifically aid in diagnosing or ruling out bipolar disorder."
