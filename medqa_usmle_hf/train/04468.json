The patient's symptoms and the daughter's statement suggest exogenous insulin use, which can result in low blood glucose levels. C-peptide level testing can confirm exogenous insulin use because C-peptide is released along with insulin and can help distinguish between endogenous and exogenous insulin. Genetic testing is not necessary in this case as there are no indications of a genetic disorder. 24 hour cortisol testing is useful in detecting Cushing's syndrome, which is not relevant in this case. Fasting blood glucose is useful in detecting diabetes mellitus, but it is not relevant in this case as the patient is already hypoglycemic."
