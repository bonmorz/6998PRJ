The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can be treated with proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole as a first-line therapy. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is usually not necessary for initial evaluation and management of GERD. Antacids like ranitidine and combinations like pantoprazole, sucralfate, and amoxicillin may also be used, but omeprazole is the most appropriate first step."
