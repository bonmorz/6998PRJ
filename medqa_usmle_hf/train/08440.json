It is recommended that women with chronic hypertension that is well controlled do not need medication during pregnancy. The patient\u2019s blood pressure is slightly elevated, but it may be due to white coat syndrome. Close monitoring is recommended throughout the pregnancy. Medications may be added if blood pressure becomes uncontrolled. Magnesium sulfate is used for preeclampsia but is not indicated in this patient without signs of the condition. Fosinopril and Labetalol are not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy."

Since the patient has a history of preeclampsia and arterial hypertension, she is at high risk for developing preeclampsia in this pregnancy. However, medications for hypertension are generally not recommended during the first trimester, as they may interfere with fetal development. The patient should be closely monitored, and lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation and a low sodium diet should be recommended. Medications may be considered later in the pregnancy if her blood pressure remains elevated. Therefore, option (D) is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient."

The patient has a history of preeclampsia and hypertension, which puts her at risk for developing preeclampsia again during pregnancy. However, the blood pressure is only mildly elevated at this point and does not require medication, so the most appropriate next step is to monitor her blood pressure and continue regular prenatal care. Option (A) Fosinopril is an ACE inhibitor and should not be used in pregnancy. Option (B) Magnesium sulfate is used for prevention and treatment of seizures in women with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, but is not indicated in this relatively mild case. Option (C) Labetalol is a beta-blocker used to manage hypertension in pregnancy, but again, is not needed in this case with only mild hypertension."

However, she has not been taking any medications and her blood pressure is only slightly elevated at 140/90 mm Hg, so it is not an emergency that requires immediate treatment with medications. Instead, the physician should counsel her on the importance of controlling her blood pressure during pregnancy, and advise her to make lifestyle modifications such as reducing sodium intake, increasing physical activity, and quitting smoking if she has not already done so. Her blood pressure should be monitored closely throughout her pregnancy. Medications such as Fosinopril or Labetalol may be considered if her blood pressure remains elevated despite lifestyle modifications, but these should be used cautiously during pregnancy and only under the guidance of an obstetrician. Magnesium sulfate is used for the prevention and treatment of eclamptic seizures, which is not indicated in this case."
