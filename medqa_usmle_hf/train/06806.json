Increasing the cut-off for a positive PPD will likely decrease the sensitivity of the test, meaning that it will be less likely to detect true cases of tuberculosis.

It may increase specificity, as it will reduce the number of false positives from individuals who may have a small reaction due to prior BCG vaccination or exposure to non-tuberculosis mycobacteria. It may also increase precision as the new cut-off provides a more defined and consistent interpretation of the test.
