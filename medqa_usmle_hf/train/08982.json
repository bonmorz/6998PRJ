The optic nerve relays information to the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus, which is responsible for processing visual information. Therefore, the most likely defective nerve in this patient is the optic nerve, which relays visual information from the eye to the brain. None of the other options are involved in the visual pathway."

The symptom of bilateral pupillary dilation when the penlight is swung from the left eye to the right eye is known as a Marcus Gunn pupil and suggests an optic nerve problem. Among the options, only the lateral geniculate nucleus receives input from the optic nerve. The Edinger-Westphal nucleus is responsible for controlling pupil size, but it is not involved in pupillary light reflex testing. The oculomotor nucleus controls the movements of the eye but is not involved in the pupillary light reflex. The ventral posteromedial nucleus is involved in pain sensation from the face, head, and neck."
