The symptoms presented in the patient, such as sudden onset of behavior changes, right arm weakness, slurred speech, and dragging right foot, suggest a stroke. The involvement of the right half of the face and numbness throughout the right side of the body indicate a lesion in the left hemisphere of the brain, which is most commonly caused by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Therefore, the angiography of the brain will most likely show a lesion in the middle cerebral artery."
