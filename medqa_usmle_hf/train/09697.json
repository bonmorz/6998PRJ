Since the patient is on a ventilator and has had recent surgery, enteral feeding via a nasogastric tube is the most appropriate next step in managing his nutrition. Total parenteral nutrition should be used only when enteral feeding is not possible or contraindicated. PEG tube may be used for longer-term feeding, but enteral feeding via nasogastric tube is the safer option given the recent surgery. Oral feeding is not appropriate at this time due to the patient being on a ventilator and the risk of aspiration."
