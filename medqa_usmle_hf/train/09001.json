The sudden onset of colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, facial swelling, and erythema of the oral mucosa suggest hereditary angioedema (HAE), a complement inhibitor deficiency disorder. The previous episode of facial swelling after a bicycle accident further supports this diagnosis. HAE is caused by a deficiency of the C1 esterase inhibitor, which can result in unregulated activation of the complement system and production of bradykinin, leading to edema and abdominal symptoms. Drug-induced bradykinin excess, immune-complex deposition, and T-cell mediated immune reactions are not typically associated with these symptoms."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including previous facial swelling and abdominal pain, suggest hereditary angioedema (HAE), which is caused by complement inhibitor deficiency.

Drug-induced bradykinin excess is not related to the patient\u2019s previous history of facial swelling and abdominal pain.
