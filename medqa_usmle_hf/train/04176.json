The patient\u2019s hypercalcemia, along with his symptoms of weakness, weight loss, and constipation, are concerning for malignancy. The elevated PTHrP level is also suggestive of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia. Chronic kidney disease would not cause such a significant elevation in calcium levels. Hyperparathyroidism would have a much higher PTH level. Hypervitaminosis D can cause hypercalcemia, but the calcitriol level is within normal limits in this patient."
