The patient has symptoms of meningitis, with the CSF analysis showing gram-negative diplococci, indicating Neisseria meningitidis. Patients with meningococcal meningitis can have coagulopathy and adrenal hemorrhage, which can lead to adrenal insufficiency, making option B the correct answer. Pancreatitis is not commonly associated with meningitis. Vesicular skin eruptions suggest herpes simplex virus infection, which is not mentioned in the question. Temporal lobe inflammation can occur with viral encephalitis but is not commonly seen with meningitis caused by bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis."
