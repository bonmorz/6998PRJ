The recommended frequency of Pap smears has changed in recent years, and for women aged 30-65 with a normal Pap result, screening every 3 years is recommended. Bone mineral density screening is recommended for women over the age of 65 or as early as 50 in women with certain risk factors. Colorectal screening is recommended for men and women beginning at age 50, and the frequency and type of screening varies based on individual risk factors."
