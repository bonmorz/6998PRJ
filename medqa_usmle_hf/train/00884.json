Metoprolol can help manage palpitations but addressing the underlying cause, in this case smoking, is the most appropriate next step."

The patient has a family history of atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction, and he smokes, which are strong risk factors for cardiovascular disease. However, the Holter monitoring and echocardiography are normal. Palpitations can also be caused by anxiety and stress, but there is no indication of this in the patient\u2019s history.
