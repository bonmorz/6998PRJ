The presentation of severe abdominal pain with radiation to the shoulders, along with hypoactive bowel sounds and diffuse abdominal rigidity, suggests acute pancreatitis or perforated viscus. A chest radiograph is necessary to rule out free air under the diaphragm, which would indicate perforation or other significant intra-abdominal pathology. Abdominal ultrasound or CT scan may be performed later, but a chest radiograph should be done first. A 12 lead electrocardiogram is not necessary as there are no signs of cardiac pathology."

Abdominal ultrasound or CT scan may be helpful in identifying the source of the abdominal pain, but should not be done until the diagnosis of pneumoperitoneum has been excluded.

The patient\u2019s presentation raises concern for acute coronary syndrome with the pain radiating to his shoulders and tachycardia. Therefore, the next best step is to perform a 12 lead electrocardiogram to evaluate for potential cardiac causes of his symptoms. If the electrocardiogram is normal, then a CT scan may be ordered to evaluate for potential causes of abdominal pain such as pancreatitis or cholecystitis. However, if the patient shows symptoms of shock, abdominal ultrasound should be performed immediately to exclude emergency surgical conditions such as ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm."
