Decreased acylcarnitine concentration can occur in various metabolic disorders, but it would not cause hypotonia in isolation."

GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and its deficiency can cause neurological symptoms such as hypotonia and seizures. Increased succinyl-CoA concentration is seen in methylmalonic aciduria, which can also cause neurological symptoms, but usually not hypotonia.
