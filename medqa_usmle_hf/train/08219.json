The symptoms of pain and paresthesia in the hand, which worsen at night and are relieved by holding the wrist in full flexion, suggest carpal tunnel syndrome, which is caused by compressed median nerve. The patient's sister having multiple sclerosis is not relevant to the diagnosis. Cervical radiculopathy would involve multiple nerve roots and not be isolated to one hand. Ulnar nerve compression would not cause symptoms in the median nerve distribution. Demyelinating disease of peripheral nerves is a general term and not specific to this patient's symptoms."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including pain, paresthesia and numbness in the hand, and aggravation with wrist flexion suggest a median nerve compression. Ulnar nerve compression may cause similar symptoms, but the aggravation would be perceived with passive ulnar deviation of the wrist. Cervical radiculopathy would involve pain in the neck and radiating down the arm. Demyelinating disease of peripheral nerves may cause similar symptoms, but there is a family history of multiple sclerosis, which suggests a possible genetic component to the nerve compression."
