However, his HCO3 and pH are also low, indicating metabolic acidosis. This suggests that there is decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, possibly due to carbon monoxide poisoning from the running car in the garage. Oxygen delivery to tissues is necessary for aerobic metabolism, which produces CO2 that can be exhaled and maintain normal pH. Decreased minute ventilation, increased metabolic rate, and decreased ability for the tissues to use oxygen would not cause this specific acid-base abnormality."

However, the bicarbonate is low indicating metabolic acidosis. The low bicarbonate suggests that there is an increase in acid production, which could be caused by tissue hypoxia (decreased oxygen delivery to tissues) leading to lactic acidosis. The decreased minute ventilation (option A) could lead to respiratory acidosis with a high PaCO2 and a compensatory increase in bicarbonate. Option C (increased metabolic rate) and option D (decreased ability for the tissues to use oxygen) are not directly related to the acid-base abnormality in this patient."

However, the patient's bicarbonate is also low, indicating metabolic acidosis. This suggests a mixed acid-base disturbance. The low pH and low bicarbonate suggest metabolic acidosis is the primary disturbance, while the low PaCO2 suggests respiratory compensation. Given that there is no evidence of burn wounds, the most likely cause of the metabolic acidosis is decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, likely due to carbon monoxide poisoning from the car exhaust."

The low HCO3 level indicates a metabolic acidosis, while the low PaCO2 indicates respiratory compensation. The high BUN level indicates some degree of renal failure, which may have contributed to the metabolic acidosis, but the cause of the patient's respiratory depression is more likely due to carbon monoxide poisoning, which can occur when a car is left running in a closed space. The low respiratory rate, slow capillary refill time, and disorientation all suggest carbon monoxide poisoning. This decreases oxygen delivery to the tissues, leading to anaerobic metabolism and acidosis. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Decreased oxygen delivery to tissues."

The low PaCO2 and high PaO2 indicate that oxygen delivery is not decreased, making option B incorrect. The patient's presentation and history of severe depression, along with the laboratory findings, are consistent with fluoxetine overdose. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that can cause respiratory depression and acidosis. This directly supports option A, which describes decreased minute ventilation."

The lower than normal HCO3- value (10 mm Hg) indicates metabolic acidosis. The PaCO2 value (23 mmHg) suggests there is respiratory compensation by hyperventilation. The elevated BUN indicates renal dysfunction, but none of the options suggest renal cause. The moist mucous membranes suggest hyperventilation rather than decreased minute ventilation. The normal oxygen saturation suggests there is sufficient oxygen delivery to the tissues, so (B) decreased oxygen delivery to tissues cannot be the cause of the acid-base abnormality. Therefore, (C) increased metabolic rate and (D) decreased ability for the tissues to use oxygen are not the right options. The answer is (A) decreased minute ventilation."
