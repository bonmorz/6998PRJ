The patient\u2019s symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis. A biopsy of the lesion would most likely show a rich dermal inflammatory infiltrate, predominantly composed of CD4+ T cells. Scant dermal inflammatory infiltrate with macrophages and dendritic cells is more commonly seen in cutaneous T cell lymphoma. The presence of a subepidermal blister and a polymorphous inflammatory infiltrate with an eosinophilic predominance is seen in bullous pemphigoid. Mucin deposition in the dermal layer is seen in dermatomyositis."
