The patient\u2019s symptoms, including altered mental status, muscle spasms, and metabolic acidosis, suggest drug toxicity, possibly from an alcohol or ethylene glycol overdose. The absence of ketones and presence of oxalate crystals in the urine suggest ethylene glycol toxicity. Fomepizole is an antidote for ethylene glycol poisoning, and is the most appropriate treatment. Ethanol can also be used, but it carries a risk of respiratory depression and other adverse effects. Hydroxocobalamin and Methylene blue are not appropriate for ethylene glycol toxicity."
