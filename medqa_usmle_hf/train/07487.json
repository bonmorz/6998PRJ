The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest megaloblastic anemia, which can be caused by a deficiency of folate or vitamin B12. However, because the serum methylmalonic acid level is normal, the cause is more likely to be a folate deficiency. Initiation of folinic acid can help alleviate symptoms and reduce the risk of developing megaloblastic anemia. Discontinuation of lisinopril and initiation of triamterene may help control blood pressure, but it is not directly related to the patient's presenting condition. Administration of high-dose vitamin B12 may help in case of a deficiency, but the lab results indicate a more likely deficiency of folate. Addition of metformin is not indicated in this case."

The peripheral smear shows hypersegmented neutrophils, which is indicative of megaloblastic anemia. Elevated homocysteine suggests a deficiency in folate or vitamin B12. Since the patient has pre-diabetes, adding metformin could help control blood glucose levels but it will not reduce the risk of developing megaloblastic anemia. Discontinuing lisinopril and initiation of triamterene might help control blood pressure, but it will not reduce the risk of developing megaloblastic anemia. Administration of daily, high-dose PO vitamin B12 can help, but folinic acid is an alternative option that can be used to reduce the risk of developing megaloblastic anemia. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Initiation of folinic acid."
