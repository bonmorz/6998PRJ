A support group can help patients feel less isolated and more empowered, and can provide an opportunity to learn from others who face similar challenges. Referring the patient to a therapist may also be helpful, but the first step should be to connect her with a supportive community. Option A is not appropriate as it assumes that the patient is not talking to her family, and may be insensitive to her fears of burdening them. Option D is dismissive of the patient's struggles and invalidates her feelings of frustration."
