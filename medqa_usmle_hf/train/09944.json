From this information, we can use Punnett squares to determine the chances of the offspring inheriting the mutation. The parents are both carriers, so their possible genotypes are Tt for the Tay-Sachs allele and tt for the normal allele. When we cross the two Tt parents, we get a Punnett square with the following probabilities: 25% chance of TT (affected with Tay-Sachs), 50% chance of Tt (carrier), and 25% chance of tt (normal). Since the patient's parents are phenotypically normal, they must be Tt carriers, so the patient has a 66% chance of also being a heterozygous carrier of the mutation."
