The patient has developed acute kidney injury, as evidenced by the increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Her recent history of herpes zoster suggests that the most likely cause of her kidney injury is obstruction of renal tubules by intratubular deposits of uric acid crystals, which can occur as a complication of herpes zoster. The other options are less likely in this case."

Formation of anti-GBM antibodies is associated with Goodpasture syndrome, which is not likely in this case.

The formation of anti-GBM antibodies is usually seen in Goodpasture syndrome and coagulative necrosis of renal papilla is often associated with obstructive uropathy from a kidney stone, but neither fit with the patient's history and presentation."
