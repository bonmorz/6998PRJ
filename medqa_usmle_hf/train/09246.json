Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, which is responsible for converting dihydrofolic acid into tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary component in DNA synthesis. This inhibits the division of rapidly dividing cells, including immune cells in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. However, it can also cause megaloblastic anemia due to inhibition of folate metabolism. Elevating tetrahydrofolate or inhibiting vitamin B12 activation are not mechanisms of action of methotrexate, and elevated methylmalonic acid levels are associated with vitamin B12 deficiency, not methotrexate use."
