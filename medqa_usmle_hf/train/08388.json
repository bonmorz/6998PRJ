Pericardiocentesis involves draining fluid from the pericardial sac and may be a temporary measure, but pericardiectomy is the definitive treatment. Pleurodesis is not relevant in this case, as there is no pleural effusion, and percutaneous aspiration with high-flow oxygen is also not appropriate for treating cardiac tamponade."
