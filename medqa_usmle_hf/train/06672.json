Following laparotomy, the blood pressure has improved but there is evidence of renal dysfunction in the form of hematuria and proteinuria, suggestive of acute tubular necrosis. The presence of muddy brown casts on urinalysis would confirm the diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis. Options A and B suggest glomerulonephritis and interstitial nephritis, respectively, which are less likely given the clinical presentation. Option D is suggestive of nephrotic syndrome, which is not relevant in this case."
