The symptoms of fatigue, pain and stiffness in hands, and sensitivity to sunlight suggest systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Checking iron studies can help diagnose if the patient has anemia which is commonly associated with SLE. Synovial fluid analysis is useful in diagnosing joint or bursa inflammation, but the entire clinical picture, including other laboratory and radiographic findings, is necessary to confirm SLE. Testing for parvovirus B19 antibodies can help diagnose fifth disease which can cause joint pain, but it is not associated with SLE. Rheumatoid factor testing can help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis, but is not specific for SLE."
