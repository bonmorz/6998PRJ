The patient's symptoms suggest a migraine headache, and the medication given to relieve the symptoms is likely a triptan drug that binds to 5-hydroxytryptamine type 1 (5-HT1) receptors. This class of drugs is effective for terminating acute migraine attacks but is not used for prevention. Angiotensin II receptors are targeted in the management of hypertension, and muscarinic receptors are targeted in the management of certain neurological and respiratory conditions. 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2 (5-HT2) receptors are targeted in the management of depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions."
