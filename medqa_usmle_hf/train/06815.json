The patient has pain in the lateral aspect of the knee, which is a common symptom of IT band syndrome, caused by friction with the lateral femoral epicondyle. The patient's history of training for a cross country meet and recent onset of pain also support this diagnosis, while the lack of joint swelling or significant joint range of motion deficits makes infection or meniscal tear less likely. The patient's history of substance use and unprotected sex may be relevant for overall health and wellness, but do not significantly impact the differential diagnosis or treatment of this knee pain."

The patient has pain localized to the lateral aspect of the knee, which is consistent with iliotibial band syndrome or ITBS. This condition is often caused by repetitive friction between the iliotibial band and the lateral femoral epicondyle. The patient's history of training and recent increase in physical activity supports this diagnosis. The other options are less likely given the patient's presentation and history, and there are no indications of joint infection or meniscal tear based on the physical exam and STI test results."

The patient\u2019s pain is localized to the lateral aspect of the knee and is worsened when she is training, which suggests friction with the lateral femoral epicondyle, a common overuse injury in runners. The lack of joint effusion or instability makes it less likely to be cartilaginous degeneration or meniscal tear. Infection of the joint space is also less likely due to the negative STI test result. The patient\u2019s history of high-risk behavior (unprotected sex, alcohol and drug use) should also be noted for further evaluation and counseling."

The location of the pain in the lateral aspect of the knee, worsened during training, suggests friction with the lateral femoral epicondyle.
