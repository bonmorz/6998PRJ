Among the options, Hemophilia is the most likely diagnosis because it is characterized by prolonged bleeding time and partial thromboplastin time, normal platelet count, and a history of easy bruising. Von Willebrand disease can also cause prolonged bleeding time, but it is accompanied by a decrease in platelet count. Glanzmann thrombasthenia and Bernard-Soulier syndrome are platelet function disorders, but the peripheral blood smear shows normal-sized platelets in this case."
