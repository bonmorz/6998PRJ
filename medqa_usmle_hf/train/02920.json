The sudden onset of shortness of breath, abdominal pain, vomiting, and rash suggests an anaphylactic reaction, which is commonly caused by IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation. The most abundant white blood cells at the site of this type of reaction are neutrophils, which are responsible for phagocytosing and clearing cellular debris and dead cells. Therefore, if a histological sample is taken from the site of the skin lesion 4 hours from now, neutrophils will mainly be found."

By that time, neutrophils would be expected to be the primary inflammatory cells involved in the skin lesion."
