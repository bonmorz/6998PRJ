The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest oral corrosives poisoning, which is most commonly caused by the ingestion of strong alkali or acid. Among the options, potassium hydroxide is a strong alkali often used in farming.

Morphine and amitriptyline are both opioids that can cause respiratory depression, but do not typically cause oral mucosal pain or profuse salivation."
