The patient's glomerular filtration rate and glucose clearance are within normal limits, suggesting good kidney function. This is an indication that the patient is not being treated with metformin or acarbose, which are typically prescribed for patients with diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance. Ifosfamide is a chemotherapy agent and is not relevant to this patient's situation. Canagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor that is commonly used to lower blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. The patient's normal glucose clearance suggests that he has good glucose tolerance and is not being treated for diabetes, but it is possible that he is using canagliflozin for other indications such as heart failure or kidney disease."

The normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and glucose clearance suggests that the patient is being treated with Canagliflozin, a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes and improve glycemic control by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the kidneys. Acarbose is also a medication for diabetes, but it works by slowing down the digestion of carbohydrates. Metformin is another common medication for type 2 diabetes, but it can affect renal function and lower GFR.
