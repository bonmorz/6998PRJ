The patient's presentation is consistent with polycystic kidney disease (PKD), which is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder. Therefore, the diagnostic modality that should be used to screen family members is renal ultrasound, which is both non-invasive and capable of detecting even small renal cysts. Abdominal CT can also be used, but it is more expensive and exposes the patient to more radiation. Renal biopsy and voiding cystourethrogram are not indicated for the diagnosis of PKD."
