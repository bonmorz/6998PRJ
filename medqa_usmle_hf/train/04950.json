The symptoms and biopsy findings strongly suggest polyarteritis nodosa, which affects small and medium arteries and can cause muscle weakness and numbness in the extremities. The remote history of cigarette smoking and Hepatitis B seropositivity are risk factors for this condition. Microscopic polyangiitis can also cause inflammation of small and medium arteries, but is typically associated with glomerulonephritis. Thromboangiitis obliterans (also known as Buerger's disease) typically affects the small and medium arteries of the extremities and is strongly associated with cigarette smoking. Raynaud disease typically presents with symptoms of cold-induced vasospasm in the fingers or toes."

The combination of transmural inflammation and fibrinoid necrosis of small and medium arteries, along with the chief complaints and history of Hepatitis B seropositivity and smoking, points towards the most likely diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa. Microscopic polyangiitis typically presents with glomerulonephritis and pulmonary capillaritis, while thromboangiitis obliterans is typically seen in young male smokers and manifests as peripheral ischemia in the lower limbs. Raynaud disease involves vasospasm of the digital arteries, and does not typically present with the symptoms described in this patient."
