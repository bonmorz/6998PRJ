The patient has jaundice, tender hepatomegaly, and elevated liver enzyme levels, which are all indicative of hepatic dysfunction. The presence of pain in the right upper quadrant suggests an obstruction of the hepatic vein, which can lead to hepatic congestion, hepatomegaly, and liver function abnormalities like elevated liver enzymes and jaundice. Thickened pericardium, increased iron absorption, and hepatic steatosis are not likely to cause these symptoms."

The symptoms of jaundice, abdominal pain localized to the right upper quadrant, and tender hepatomegaly indicate hepatocellular injury. Hemoglobin concentration of 19.2 g/dL suggests polycythemia vera, which can cause hepatic vein obstruction. Thickened pericardium causes constrictive pericarditis, which doesn't fit the presented symptoms. Increased iron absorption causes hereditary hemochromatosis, which doesn't present with a distended abdomen or tender hepatomegaly. Hepatic steatosis can cause elevated liver enzyme levels but doesn't suggest the distended abdomen or hemoglobin concentration. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is hepatic vein obstruction."
