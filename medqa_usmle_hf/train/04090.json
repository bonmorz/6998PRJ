Mifepristone is an anti-progestin that works by blocking the effects of progesterone on the uterus, which leads to increased myometrial sensitivity to contractions and induced decidual breakdown.

Option B, induction of cervical dilation, is incorrect because cervical dilation is usually accomplished with prostaglandins, not mifepristone. Option D, interference with placental blood supply, is incorrect because mifepristone does not directly affect the placenta."
