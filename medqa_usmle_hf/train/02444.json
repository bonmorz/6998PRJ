The symptoms suggest Cluster headache, which is often associated with autonomic symptoms such as tearing, rhinorrhea, and ptosis. Medication overuse headache is unlikely because the patient has not had relief even after taking indomethacin. Giant cell arteritis can cause headaches and temporal artery tenderness but does not cause autonomic symptoms. Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by sharp, stabbing pain in the face and does not cause autonomic symptoms."

The lack of relief from indomethacin and localized tenderness along the right supraspinatus muscle suggest that other options are less likely."

The severe headache on the left forehead and eye, drooping of the left eyelid, tearing of the left eye, and rhinorrhea suggest a cluster headache. The fact that the patient has had similar symptoms last summer also supports this diagnosis. The localized tenderness along the right supraspinatus muscle may be an incidental finding. Giant cell arteritis would have other signs and symptoms like scalp tenderness and jaw claudication. Medication overuse headache is unlikely since the patient has only been taking indomethacin for 24 hours. Trigeminal neuralgia typically presents with more severe pain and is often triggered by touch or movement."

The symptoms, including severe headaches on the left forehead and eye, drooping of the left eyelid, tearing of the left eye, and rhinorrhea, suggest that the most likely diagnosis is cluster headache. Indomethacin is not typically effective for cluster headaches, but it is effective for hemicrania continua, which sometimes resembles cluster headache. The tenderness along the right supraspinatus muscle is not relevant to the diagnosis of cluster headache. The absence of any visual problems or jaw pain rules out giant cell arteritis and trigeminal neuralgia. There is no evidence to suggest medication overuse headache."
