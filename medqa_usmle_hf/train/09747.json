Chiari II malformation is associated with a protrusion of the cerebellum and brainstem into the spinal canal, which can cause hydrocephalus and lead to symptoms such as headaches, vomiting, and ataxia. The history of surgical removal of a sac-like protuberance on the lower back is consistent with a myelomeningocele, which is a common finding in patients with Chiari II malformation. The MRI image also shows cerebellar herniation, further supporting this diagnosis. The other options are less likely given the clinical presentation and imaging findings."

The history of surgical removal of a sac-like protuberance on his lower back soon after birth suggests a myelomeningocele, which is commonly associated with Chiari II malformation.

The MRI of the brain also shows a herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, which is a hallmark of Chiari II malformation. Bilateral optic disk swelling suggests increased intracranial pressure, which is also commonly seen in Chiari II malformation."

The clinical presentation, along with the history of surgically removing a sac-like protuberance on his lower back (suggesting a myelomeningocele), and the image provided indicate a Chiari II malformation. The ataxia, optic disk swelling, and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure are all associated findings with this malformation. Ependymoma or Medulloblastoma can also cause similar symptoms, but the imaging findings are inconsistent with those diagnoses. Dandy-Walker malformation primarily affects the cerebellum and fourth ventricle, and it\u2019s unlikely to cause the optic disk swelling seen in this case."
