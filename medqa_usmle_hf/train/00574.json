A meta-analysis is the statistical pooling of the results from multiple studies, which can provide a more comprehensive analysis of the available evidence. It is different from a randomized control trial, case-cohort study, and cross-sectional study in that it does not involve collecting new data, but rather synthesizing existing data from previous studies."

The question describes a situation where your colleague wants to investigate the association between beta-carotene and heart disease, but finds conflicting results in the literature. The recommendation to pool the results from all the studies is a meta-analysis, which is a statistical technique used to combine the results from multiple studies into a single analysis. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) meta-analysis."

The recommendation to pool results from all studies on the topic refers to a meta-analysis, which uses statistical methods to combine results from different studies to increase power and identify patterns among study results.

A case-cohort study is a variation of a cohort study and compares people with a particular condition or outcome to a similar group that does not have the condition or outcome. A cross-sectional study measures the prevalence of a disease or condition at a particular point in time among a defined population."
