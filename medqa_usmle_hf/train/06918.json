Displacement is the most relevant ego defense mechanism in this situation, as the intern is redirecting their frustration and anger from the chief resident towards the medical student, who is not the source of the problem. Projection involves attributing one's own thoughts, feelings, or behaviors onto another person, while passive aggression involves indirectly expressing anger or hostility. Reaction formation involves expressing the opposite of one's true feelings or impulses."

Displacement is the redirection of unacceptable thoughts or impulses from a more threatening individual to a less threatening one, and in this case, the intern redirected the frustration from the chief resident to the medical student. Passive aggression is a form of indirect resistance to demands or requests, which is not demonstrated in this scenario. Projection is the attribution of one's own unacceptable desires or motives to someone else, which does not fit this situation either. Reaction formation is the act of defending against an unacceptable impulse by adopting the opposite attitude, which is not applicable here. Therefore, the most relevant ego defense mechanism in this situation is displacement."
