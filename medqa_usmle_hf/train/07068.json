The patient is presenting with classic symptoms of nephrolithiasis, including acute onset abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and hematuria. The presence of an obstruction at the ureteropelvic junction on renal ultrasound further supports this diagnosis. The pain associated with nephrolithiasis is typically colicky and radiates to the groin, which is described as option (C). Option (B) is incorrect because flank pain that does not radiate to the groin is not a usual symptom of nephrolithiasis. Options (A) and (D) describe symptoms that would not typically be seen in a patient with nephrolithiasis."
