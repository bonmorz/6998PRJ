The patient is presenting with symptoms of a severe bacterial sinus infection, and the bulging eye and ptosis suggest severe complications like orbital cellulitis or abscess.

Intranasal sumatriptan and intravenous dihydroergotamine are options for migraine treatment, while surgical debridement is not the first-line treatment for sinus infections."

The symptoms suggest acute bacterial sinusitis, which can lead to severe complications like orbital cellulitis or abscess.

Surgical debridement may be necessary in severe cases, but not as first-line treatment. Intranasal sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine are medications used for the treatment of migraines, which is not the most likely diagnosis in this patient."
