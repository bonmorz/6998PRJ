The presence of reducing substances in the urine indicates a possible galactosemia, which is a deficiency in galactose metabolism. Giving apple juice to a healthy infant would lead to an increase in activity of the enzyme hexokinase, which is important in glucose metabolism. However, in a patient with galactosemia, giving apple juice would not have the same effect as the enzymes involved in galactose metabolism are deficient. Therefore, this question is asking for the enzyme that would be affected in a healthy infant, which is hexokinase."

Giving apple juice to this patient will result in increased activity of Hexokinase due to the excess fructose present in apple juice, which will be metabolized via the hexokinase pathway. This is why apple juice is not recommended for infants with suspected carbohydrate metabolism disorders like galactosemia. Aldolase B is involved in fructose metabolism but is not relevant in this case. Galactokinase is involved in galactose metabolism and \u03b1-1,6-glucosidase is involved in glycogen metabolism, but neither are affected by fructose intake."
