HIPAA regulations permit doctors to share information with family members if the patient is present and does not object.

Referring the patient to a substance abuse program may be appropriate if it is determined that the patient has a history of drug abuse and may be misusing the prescribed medication. Contacting the physician's medical practice insurance company would not be necessary at this time unless a claim is actually filed. Informing the patient's wife that the information cannot be accepted because of HIPAA is not helpful at this point as it does not address the issue at hand."
