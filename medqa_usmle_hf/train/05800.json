The patient has developed symptoms of diabetes insipidus (DI) after surgery, which can occur due to damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland during surgery. A water deprivation test is used to diagnose DI. In the test, the patient is deprived of water for a period of time, and urine and blood osmolality are measured. Desmopressin is then given, which is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin (ADH) and should increase urine concentration. Therefore, we would expect to see an increase in urine osmolality to greater than 264 mOsm/L after the administration of desmopressin."
