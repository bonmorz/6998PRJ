The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, malnourishment, glossitis, and an elevated MCV, which suggests megaloblastic anemia. Alcoholism can contribute to this condition by causing folate and vitamin B12 deficiency. Elevated homocysteine levels are often seen in these patients. Methionine is an essential amino acid necessary for protein synthesis. Cysteine is a nonessential amino acid that plays a role in the formation of disulfide bonds in proteins. Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid that can lead to phenylketonuria if not metabolized properly."
