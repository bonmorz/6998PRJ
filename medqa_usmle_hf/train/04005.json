The patient\u2019s symptoms, along with the increased numbness after tapping the inguinal ligament, suggests the diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica, which is caused by compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve in the inguinal ligament. Advising the patient to wear looser pants can help alleviate the symptoms. MRI of the lumbar spine is not indicated as the straight leg test is negative and there are no signs of radiculopathy. Blood work for inflammatory markers is not indicated as the patient\u2019s symptoms are likely neurological in nature. Reduction of physical activity may be helpful in the long term for weight loss but will not directly address the meralgia paresthetica."
