It works by suppressing the ciliary epithelium, which produces aqueous humor, thus reducing the amount of fluid in the eye and lowering intraocular pressure. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. Option (A) refers to prostaglandin analogs, (C) refers to osmotic diuretics, and (D) refers to rho kinase inhibitors, which are all used for intraocular pressure reduction, but not via the mechanism of action of timolol."
