The symptoms of a painless genital ulcer, inguinal lymphadenopathy, and recent unprotected sex with multiple partners suggest the most likely diagnosis is syphilis.

Swabbing the chancre and performing a saline wet mount can help diagnose herpes simplex virus, and the Frei test is not used in the diagnosis of syphilis."
