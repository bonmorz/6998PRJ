The phenomenon observed in the dog blood can be explained by the Bohr effect, which states that an increase in carbon dioxide levels can cause a decrease in pH, which facilitates the unloading of oxygen from hemoglobin in peripheral tissue. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. Option (A) is related to the Haldane effect, which does not fully explain the observed phenomenon. Option (B) is not a known threshold in blood, and option (D) incorrectly states that high CO2 levels cause alkalemia, which is actually caused by high levels of bicarbonate ions."

This phenomenon can be explained by the Bohr effect, which states that high partial pressure of CO2 in tissues facilitates oxygen unloading in peripheral tissues.

Option A is the opposite phenomenon, and option B and D are not related to this particular phenomenon."

The phenomenon can be explained by the Bohr effect, which states that an increase in carbon dioxide or a decrease in pH (as seen in tissues with high carbon dioxide levels) results in a decrease in the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, leading to increased unloading of oxygen in peripheral tissues. Therefore, high partial pressure of CO2 in tissues facilitates O2 unloading in peripheral tissues. Options A and D are incorrect as they refer to the opposite phenomenon (i.e. the release of CO2 from hemoglobin and the promotion of alkalosis respectively). Option B is incorrect as there is no known threshold for the sum of partial pressures of CO2 and O2 in blood."

The increase in oxygen pressure in peripheral tissues can be explained by the Bohr effect, which states that a high partial pressure of CO2 in tissues facilitates the unloading of oxygen from hemoglobin in peripheral tissues. This is due to the fact that CO2 binding to hemoglobin decreases hemoglobin\u2019s affinity for oxygen, allowing oxygen to be more readily released to peripheral tissues.

The increase in oxygen pressure in peripheral tissue with the addition of carbon dioxide suggests that CO2 facilitates O2 unloading in peripheral tissues. This is due to the Bohr effect, which states that increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood cause a decrease in pH, which leads to a decreased affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen and thus facilitates oxygen unloading at peripheral tissues. Option A describes the reverse phenomenon, where the binding of O2 to hemoglobin in lungs drives release of CO2 from hemoglobin.
