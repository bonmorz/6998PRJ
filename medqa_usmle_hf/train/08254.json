The single-ringed \u00df-lactam structure is characteristic of penicillins, which can cause allergic reactions and may have been stopped due to the patient's known allergy to cephalosporins, which have a similar structure."

Options (A) and (D) are both characteristics of penicillin, but the patient's allergy to cephalosporins makes it more likely that a cephalosporin was the drug that was stopped.
