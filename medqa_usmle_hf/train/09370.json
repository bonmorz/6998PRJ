In this case, the patient's belief of infidelity in his spouse is a non-bizarre delusion. Option A is incorrect as daily functioning may or may not be impaired. Option C is incorrect as the active symptom duration for delusional disorder is at least 1 month, but there is no requirement for a specific total duration. Option D is incorrect as there is no requirement for having 1 symptom from the core domain in the diagnostic criteria for delusional disorder."
