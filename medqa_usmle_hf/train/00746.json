The patient has multiple risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), such as surgery, cancer, immobility, and obesity. The symptoms suggest DVT, and the laboratory studies show thrombocytopenia, which can be caused by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT is a rare but serious condition caused by an immune reaction to heparin, which can lead to thrombosis. The most appropriate next step in management is to switch from unfractionated heparin to argatroban therapy, which is a direct thrombin inhibitor and can be used as an alternative to heparin in the setting of HIT. Switching to warfarin therapy is not appropriate because it takes several days to reach therapeutic effect, and during this time, the patient would be at risk of untreated thrombosis. Administering vitamin K is not appropriate because the patient has normal prothrombin time and international normalized ratio. Transfusing platelet concentrate is not appropriate because it can exacerbate thrombosis in the setting of HIT."

The patient presents with severe pain and swelling in the left calf, as well as necrotic lesions on the bilateral thighs, indicating a high probability of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which is a severe adverse reaction to unfractionated heparin. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to switch from unfractionated heparin to argatroban therapy, as argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor that can be used in patients with HIT. Switching to warfarin therapy or administering vitamin K would not be appropriate for HIT, and transfusing platelet concentrate may worsen the condition."
