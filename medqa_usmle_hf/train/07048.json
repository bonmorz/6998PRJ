Based on the patient's symptoms and history, the primary underlying etiology for her urinary incontinence is likely increased detrusor muscle activity, also known as overactive bladder. This can be confirmed with urodynamic testing. Increased urine bladder volumes may contribute to stress urinary incontinence, but this is not the primary cause in this case. Trauma to the urinary tract is not indicated in the patient's history, and decreased pelvic floor muscle tone is not likely given her recent surgical treatment for pelvic organ prolapse."
