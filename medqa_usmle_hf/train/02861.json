Granzymes, which are involved in cytotoxicity, are produced by natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells, but not by CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells are involved in both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses, but the question specifically asks about the response to interleukin-12, which suggests a cell-mediated immune response."
