The drug that is most likely added is candesartan, which is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) that blocks the action of angiotensin II. It increases serum renin, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II levels, and decreases serum aldosterone levels, without affecting bradykinin levels. This helps to lower blood pressure. Aliskiren is a renin inhibitor and also increases renin levels, but it's less commonly used than ARBs like candesartan. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor that also blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, but it increases bradykinin levels in addition to affecting the other hormones. Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic and wouldn't affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system."

The drug added to the medication regimen increases renin, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II levels while decreasing serum aldosterone levels. Candesartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) that specifically blocks the action of angiotensin II on its receptors. Aliskiren blocks the production of renin while Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor that blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic that does not affect renin, angiotensin I, angiotensin II, or aldosterone levels.
