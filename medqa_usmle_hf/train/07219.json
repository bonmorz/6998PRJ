A nasal transepithelial potential difference test can help diagnose cystic fibrosis in patients with normal sweat chloride concentrations. A chest radiograph, complete blood count, and urinalysis would not aid in confirming suspicions of cystic fibrosis."

Clubbing of nails may also suggest lung disease, and a chest radiograph can help diagnose that. A complete blood count and urinalysis are unlikely to aid in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.
