The symptoms of shortness of breath, dry cough, and wheezing suggest that the inflammation is happening at the level of the airways. Terminal bronchioles are the smallest airways in the lung that can be affected by inflammation and cause these symptoms. Pleural cavity inflammation can cause pleurisy and chest pain, while inflammation of the alveoli can lead to pneumonia. Distal trachea inflammation can lead to tracheitis, but it usually doesn't cause wheezing."

The end-expiratory wheezing and decreased inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio suggest bronchospasm, which occurs in the smaller airways or terminal bronchioles. Inflammation may contribute to the bronchospasm by causing constriction and thickening of the airway walls. Therefore, the correct answer is terminal bronchioles. Pleural cavity inflammation may cause pleurisy, which presents with pain during breathing. Alveolar inflammation may cause pneumonia, which presents with a productive cough and fever. Distal trachea inflammation may cause croup, which presents with barking cough and stridor."
