Digoxin acts by increasing vagal tone, which slows AV nodal conduction and therefore, prolongs the PR interval. Inhibition of myocardial Na+/K+ ATPase and AV nodal L-type Ca2+ channels actually increase conduction velocity, while decrease in intracellular cAMP reduces cardiac contractility."

Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that increases parasympathetic tone, which can slow down the heart rate and increase the refractory period in the AV node, leading to PR interval prolongation. Option (A) is incorrect because digoxin inhibits the Na+/K+ ATPase in cardiac myocytes, leading to an increase in intracellular sodium and calcium, which can cause positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. Option (B) is incorrect because digoxin inhibits the AV node L-type calcium channels, leading to prolongation of the refractory period.

Digoxin works by inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, which leads to increased intracellular calcium levels and a strengthened force of contraction. However, it can also increase vagal tone, which can lead to AV nodal blockade and PR prolongation. Option (A) is partially correct but incomplete since it doesn't explain the PR prolongation specifically. Option (B) is incorrect as Digoxin doesn't inhibit AV node L-type Ca2+ channels.
