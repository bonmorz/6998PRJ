The growth on the penis that has been gradually increasing in size and the presence of multiple sexual partners suggests a sexually transmitted infection. Among the options, only human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to cause genital warts and increase the risk of developing cancer in the genital area. The biopsy findings with invasion into the corpus cavernosum are consistent with an aggressive cancer associated with HPV. Epstein-Barr virus is associated with infectious mononucleosis and certain cancers but not with genital warts. Haemophilus ducreyi and Chlamydia trachomatis are associated with chancroid and lymphogranuloma venereum, respectively, but not with genital warts."

The presentation of a nontender ulcerated lesion with left inguinal lymphadenopathy is most consistent with penile cancer, which is strongly associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.

Epstein-Barr virus is known to cause lymphoma in immunocompromised individuals, but it is not associated with penile cancer. Haemophilus ducreyi and Chlamydia trachomatis can cause sexually transmitted infections but are not associated with penile cancer."
