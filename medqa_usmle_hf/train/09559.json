The patient presents with symptoms of vertigo and ataxia, along with sensory deficit on one side of the face and body, suggesting a cerebellar or brainstem stroke. The presence of hypoalgesia and decreased temperature sensation suggest that the trigeminal nerve and the spinothalamic tract may be affected. The absence of the gag reflex is likely due to involvement of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves, which are also commonly affected in brainstem strokes. Hemiparesis and hemianopia may also be present but are less likely to affect the gag reflex."

The patient presents with right-sided limb ataxia and sensory deficits on the right side of the face and left side of the body, which strongly suggest a stroke. The fact that the patient still feels like she is being pulled to the right side indicates that there may be involvement of the vestibular system. Absence of the gag reflex suggests involvement of the medulla, which is a common site for strokes in the posterior circulation. Hemiparesis and hemianopia are also common findings in strokes, but they are not specific to involvement of the medulla. Intact cough reflex is not a typical finding in patients with strokes involving the brainstem."

The cerebellum is responsible for coordinating movements and maintaining balance, so the limb ataxia and feeling of being pulled to one side make sense. The hypoalgesia and decreased temperature sensation on opposite sides of the body are due to a phenomenon called contralateral sensory loss. The absence of the gag reflex is more commonly associated with brainstem lesions, but it is still a possible finding in this patient given the location of the stroke. Hemiparesis and hemianopia are also common findings in stroke, but they are not as likely to be present in this patient based on the information provided."
