Elevated troponin levels confirm the diagnosis. The best next step in management would be to initiate antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel, initiate beta-blockade with atenolol, anticoagulation with heparin or low molecular weight heparin, and continuous cardiac monitoring. Echocardiography can be useful to assess the extent of myocardial damage and to rule out mechanical complications like ventricular septal defect or papillary muscle rupture. CT scan of the chest with contrast may be useful in patients suspected of having aortic dissection but is not warranted in this case. Oral nifedipine is not recommended for initial treatment of acute coronary syndrome."
