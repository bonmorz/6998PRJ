The clinical signs and examination findings suggest pyloric stenosis, which is caused by hypertrophic muscularis externa.

Failure of neural crest cell migration into the rectum leads to Hirschsprung disease, which presents with constipation and abdominal distension. Telescoping of the small bowel into the large bowel, or intussusception, typically presents with abdominal pain and bloody stools."

The symptoms and physical examination suggest the most likely diagnosis is infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), which is caused by hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the muscularis externa of the pylorus, leading to gastric outlet obstruction.

Failure of neural crest cell migration into the rectum would cause Hirschsprung's disease, which presents with failure to pass meconium, constipation, and abdominal distention in neonates. Telescoping of the small bowel into the large bowel would cause intussusception, which presents with vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody stool in infants and toddlers."

The description of projectile vomiting, non-bloody and non-bilious vomitus, and palpable epigastric mass suggests the most likely diagnosis is hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.
