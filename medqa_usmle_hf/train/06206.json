Given the patient's recent infectious mononucleosis, anemia of chronic disease is a possibility. Ferritin levels can help distinguish between iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease. A peripheral blood smear may also be ordered to further evaluate the anemia, but ferritin levels are a more appropriate initial step."
