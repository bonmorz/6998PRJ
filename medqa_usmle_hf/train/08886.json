Among the options, activation of primed neutrophils is the most likely cause, leading to acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Cytokine accumulation during blood storage can also cause transfusion reactions, but it usually occurs after multiple transfusions. ABO incompatibility and Type I hypersensitivity reactions are other possible mechanisms, but they are less likely in this case."

The symptoms and the chest x-ray suggest acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may be caused by transfusion-associated circulatory overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury, or volume overload. However, the symptoms also suggest sepsis, which may cause ARDS. Among the options, activation of primed neutrophils is the most likely underlying mechanism of a transfusion reaction in this patient, as it can cause ARDS and is associated with alcohol use disorder and cigarette smoking. ABO incompatibility can cause hemolytic transfusion reactions and cytokine accumulation during blood storage can cause febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions, but neither is likely to cause the symptoms in this patient. Type I hypersensitivity reaction may cause anaphylaxis but is less likely to cause ARDS."
