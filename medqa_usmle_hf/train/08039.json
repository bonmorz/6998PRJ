The patient's laboratory studies suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI), which can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes if left untreated. Nitrofurantoin is an appropriate antibiotic for treating UTIs during pregnancy. The duration of treatment depends on the severity of the infection, but seven days is a common course for uncomplicated UTIs. Therefore, the best next step in management would be to prescribe Nitrofurantoin for seven days. Observation without treatment is not recommended due to the risk of complications. Repeat cultures after one week without treatment could lead to progression of the infection and potentially worse outcomes for the patient and fetus. Nitrofurantoin for the duration of pregnancy is not necessary unless the patient has recurrent UTIs."
