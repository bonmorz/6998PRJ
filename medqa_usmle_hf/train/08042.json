The MRI shows ischemic changes of the right lateral medulla, indicating a Wallenberg syndrome or lateral medullary syndrome. This typically presents with vertigo, nystagmus, dysarthria, hiccups, and ipsilateral loss of pain and thermal sensations over the face and opposite limbs. The gag reflex is typically decreased, but there is no deviation of the tongue or facial paralysis. Paralysis of the right lower limb would not be expected as the lesion is in the medulla, which does not control motor function of the limbs."

Ischemic changes in the lateral medulla could indicate lateral medullary syndrome, which is also called Wallenberg syndrome. The syndrome is characterized by a wide variety of symptoms that depend on the particular blood vessel that has been affected. The symptoms may include hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and decreased gag reflex, among others. Among the options, decreased gag reflex is the most likely to be seen in this patient since it is related to the function of the medulla oblongata."
