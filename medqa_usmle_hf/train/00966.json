Progestin therapy is the first-line treatment in reproductive-aged women who desire future fertility. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingoopherectomy is a drastic approach and should be considered only in patients who do not want future fertility or who have persistent disease despite medical therapy. Partial, cervix-sparing hysterectomy is also a radical treatment that should only be considered in patients with persistent disease or those not wanting future fertility. Observation with annual endometrial biopsies is not recommended due to the high risk of progression to endometrial cancer."
