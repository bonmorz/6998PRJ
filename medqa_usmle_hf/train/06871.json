The symptoms of lethargy, poor muscle tone, and feeding difficulty with occasional regurgitation that recently turned into projectile vomiting suggest a possible disorder in organic acid metabolism. Elevated levels of ketone bodies, glycine, and methylmalonic acid further suggest a deficiency in the enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase, which converts propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. Therefore, the deficient enzyme catalyzes the reaction of converting propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. The correct answer is (B)."
