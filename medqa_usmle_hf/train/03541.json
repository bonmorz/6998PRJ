The best solution to avoid such miscommunications is hiring a qualified medical interpreter in patients\u2019 native languages. This will allow patients to fully understand their medical care and ensure their comfort and safety. Using a family member as an interpreter may lead to ethical and legal issues, while limiting encounters with such patients to noneducational visits is not a feasible solution. Employing medical staff with language proficiency may be helpful, but it is not a guarantee that they will be available at all times."

The scenario in the question highlights the importance of having a qualified medical interpreter available to facilitate clear communication between patients and healthcare providers. Asking a family member may not be appropriate due to conflict of interest or potential bias. Employing medical staff with above-average familiarity with a language other than English may not always be feasible, and it does not necessarily guarantee effective communication. Limiting encounters with such patients for educational visits is not a practical solution as these visits are essential for medical education and training. Hiring a qualified medical interpreter in patients' native languages is the most effective way to ensure accurate communication and maintain patient satisfaction and safety."
