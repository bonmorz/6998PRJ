The characteristic of the murmur decreasing on rapid squatting and increasing on Valsalva maneuver suggests that it is a functional murmur. A grade 3/6 murmur is considered moderate to severe. While grade 3/6 is not necessarily indicative of a significant heart problem, the increase in intensity on Valsalva suggests that this individual has a risk of sudden cardiac death."

The given information indicates that the patient has a ventricular septal defect (VSD) and the specific characteristics of the murmur suggest that it is a subaortic VSD. This type of VSD carries an increased risk of sudden cardiac death due to the proximity of the defect to the left bundle branch of the conduction system. Angiodysplasia, infective endocarditis, and pulmonary apoplexy are not directly associated with VSDs."
