Thrombin is an important clotting factor that plays a role in converting fibrinogen to fibrin, which forms the basis of blood clots. A decreased concentration of thrombin in the plasma can lead to decreased clot formation and prolonged bleeding. Protein C deficiency and plasmin deficiency can also cause bleeding disorders, but they are less likely to result in the prolonged bleeding seen in this patient. Factor VII deficiency can cause bleeding, but it is associated with prolonged prothrombin time, which is not seen in this patient."
