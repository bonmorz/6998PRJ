The pelvic ring fracture can cause impingement of the femoral nerve, which innervates the adductors of the hip, resulting in impaired adduction of the hip. Impaired hip extension would be more likely with injury to the gluteal muscles, while impaired knee extension and sensory deficit of the dorsal foot would suggest injury to the sciatic nerve."
