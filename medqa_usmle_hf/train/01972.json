Cholera toxin indeed ADP-ribosylates Gs and keeps adenylate cyclase active, which increases the level of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP). The other options are incorrect: Diphtheria toxin inhibits protein synthesis by ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor-2; Botulinum toxin cleaves synaptobrevin, blocking vesicle formation and the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter acetylcholine; Anthrax toxin also inhibits protein synthesis by ADP-ribosylation of EF-2."

Cholera toxin acts by ADP-ribosylating Gs and increasing cAMP levels, leading to secretion of large amounts of water and electrolytes into the intestines. Diphtheria toxin cleaves elongation factor 2 and inhibits protein synthesis. Botulinum toxin cleaves SNAP-25, blocking vesicle formation and the release of acetylcholine. Anthrax toxin produces edema factor and lethal factor, both of which disrupt cellular signaling pathways but do not ADP-ribosylate elongation factor 2. Therefore, the correct pair is (B) Cholera toxin - ADP-ribosylates Gs, keeping adenylate cyclase active and \u2191 [cAMP]."

Botulinum toxin cleaves synaptobrevin, blocking the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters, leading to muscle paralysis. Anthrax toxin can edema factor, lethal factor, and protective antigen, which can cause tissue destruction, immune suppression, and cell death, respectively.

Cholera toxin binds to and activates G proteins in intestinal cells, leading to the production of cAMP and subsequent loss of electrolytes and fluid into the lumen, causing diarrhea. Diphtheria toxin inhibits protein synthesis by ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor-2 (EF-2). Botulinum toxin cleaves proteins involved in vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release, leading to muscle paralysis. Anthrax toxin has three components, with one component ADP-ribosylating EF-2, inhibiting protein synthesis.
