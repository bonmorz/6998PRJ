The patient has symptoms of irritability, loss of appetite, fatigue, and social withdrawal, which are consistent with major depressive disorder. Substance abuse is not the most likely diagnosis, as the patient has only tried alcohol twice at a party last year and there is no other indication of substance abuse. The symptoms are not consistent with an adjustment disorder, as they have persisted for three weeks. The lack of improvement over time suggests persistent depressive disorder is less likely as a diagnosis."

The patient has several symptoms of depression, including extreme irritability, fatigue, loss of appetite, withdrawal from activities, and academic decline. These symptoms have persisted for more than two weeks, which suggests major depressive disorder as the most likely diagnosis. Substance abuse is not supported by the patient history or physical examination. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood would not explain the duration and severity of the symptoms. Persistent depressive disorder requires symptoms to persist for at least two years."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest major depressive disorder, including irritability, fatigue, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, decreased interest in previously enjoyed activities and impaired academic performance. Substance abuse can have similar symptoms but it is less likely given that the patient reports only trying alcohol twice a year ago. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood is also a possibility, but the symptoms have persisted for 3 weeks which is longer than the typical 6-month duration for adjustment disorder. Persistent depressive disorder is characterized by chronic depressive symptoms, which may have been present earlier in the patient\u2019s life. The recent onset of symptoms make major depressive disorder the most likely diagnosis."

The symptoms are indicative of major depressive disorder, which includes irritable mood, fatigue, loss of interest in activities, and sleep disturbance.

Substance abuse can cause irritability and mood changes but is less likely given the limited history of alcohol use. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood may be a possibility but does not have the same duration of symptoms as major depressive disorder. Persistent depressive disorder requires symptoms lasting for at least two years, which is not present in this case."
