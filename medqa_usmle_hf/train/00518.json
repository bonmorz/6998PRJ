The patient is likely presenting with symptoms of neurosyphilis, as suggested by the history of a past maculopapular rash and physical exam findings. The first test to be performed in such a scenario would be agglutination of antibodies with beef cardiolipin, which is a non-specific test for syphilis. Other tests, such as indirect immunofluorescence or agglutination with Proteus O antigens, may also be used to confirm the diagnosis. Cytoplasmic inclusions on Giemsa stain are seen in chlamydia infections and may not be relevant to this patient's presentation."
