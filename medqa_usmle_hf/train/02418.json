Phantom limb pain often occurs after an amputation and presents with sensations such as shooting pain and tingling in the missing limb. The patient\u2019s stump is slightly erythematous with clean sutures, which does not suggest foreign body reaction or reinfarction. While the patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, the absence of other symptoms such as muscle weakness or sensory loss does not suggest diabetic neuropathy."
