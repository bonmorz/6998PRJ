As the drug works by inhibiting the reduction of Vitamin K, the correct answer is D. This action prevents the activation of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, and the anticoagulation effect reduces the risk of thromboembolic complications."

This decreases the risk of thromboembolic complications without the need for regular monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) as is necessary with warfarin, which inhibits the reduction of vitamin K more broadly."
