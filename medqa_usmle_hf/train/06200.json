The most likely underlying cause is a loss-of-function mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor, which regulates parathyroid hormone secretion. Impaired tubular calcium reabsorption can also cause hyperparathyroidism, but the patient's 24-hour urine calcium level is normal. Decreased sensitivity to parathyroid hormone and over-secretion of parathyroid hormone are not consistent with the patient's laboratory findings."

The elevated serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels suggest hyperparathyroidism, and the normal serum phosphate level suggests a problem with the calcium sensing receptor. Among the options, only (C) fits with these findings, as it describes a loss-of-function mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor. This mutation results in reduced sensitivity to calcium and therefore, leads to increased parathyroid hormone secretion and hypercalcemia."

The patient\u2019s serum calcium level is elevated, and her parathyroid hormone level is significantly above the normal range, indicating primary hyperparathyroidism. The most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a parathyroid adenoma, but in the absence of visible adenoma, a loss-of-function mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor is a possible cause. This receptor senses the extracellular calcium levels and adjusts the parathyroid hormone secretion accordingly. A loss-of-function mutation in this receptor can lead to elevated serum calcium levels and over-secretion of parathyroid hormone. Decreased sensitivity to parathyroid hormone (A) or impaired tubular calcium reabsorption (B) are not plausible causes of primary hyperparathyroidism. Over-secretion of parathyroid hormone (D) is correct, but choice C is more specific in explaining how over-secretion happens in this case."
