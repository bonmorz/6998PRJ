Hypospadias is a congenital condition where the opening of the urethra is located on the underside of the penis instead of at the tip. It results from failure of the urethral folds to fuse, not the genital folds. It is not associated with younger maternal age or timing of repair, but urethrocutaneous fistula is a known complication of surgery. The urethral anatomy is formed before the 12th week of intrauterine development."

Option (C) is incorrect, as the urethral development occurs between the 4th and 12th week of intrauterine life.
