The medication candoxatril inhibits the breakdown of a vasodilatory mediator released from the heart that promotes excretion of sodium and improves ejection fraction. This mediator is most likely natriuretic peptides, and the inhibition of its breakdown can increase its levels. Therefore, the correct answer is (D), natriuretic peptides.

The drug candoxatril inhibits the breakdown of a vasodilatory mediator, which promotes the excretion of sodium from the body and improves ejection fraction. This mediator is likely to be natriuretic peptides, which are released from the heart in response to stretching of the heart muscle. Therefore, as the drug increases the levels of natriuretic peptides, the excretion of sodium is also increased, leading to improved heart function. Nitric oxide is also a vasodilator, but it is not directly affected by candoxatril. Leukotrienes and acetylcholine have no role in heart failure management."

The drug candoxatril inhibits the breakdown of a vasodilatory mediator released from the heart, which is likely to be the natriuretic peptides. Increasing natriuretic peptides is a potential treatment strategy for heart failure as they promote the excretion of sodium from the body and improve the ejection fraction.
