The symptoms, along with the laboratory results showing low serum albumin, high serum triglycerides and cholesterol, and 4+ protein in urine suggest nephrotic syndrome. The best initial therapy for nephrotic syndrome is Prednisolone. Albumin infusion may be used in severe cases, but not as initial therapy. Enalapril may be used to treat hypertension and reduce proteinuria, but not as initial therapy. Prednisolone and cyclophosphamide is used for steroid-resistant cases."
