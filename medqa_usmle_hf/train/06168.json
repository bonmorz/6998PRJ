The rationale for concurrent use of anticoagulants during the transition from heparin to warfarin is to compensate for the initial prothrombotic property of warfarin. Heparin is a rapid-acting anticoagulant that can prevent thrombus formation in the first 1\u20132 days of warfarin therapy. This helps to prevent the patient from developing blood clots before warfarin takes effect."

The rationale for concurrent use of anticoagulants is to compensate for the initial prothrombotic effect of warfarin, as it takes several days for warfarin to achieve its full anticoagulant effect.

The rationale underlying the concurrent use of anticoagulants is to compensate for the initial prothrombotic property of warfarin.
