The patient is presenting with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including weight loss despite increased appetite, hyperhidrosis, increased urinary volume and frequency, and tachycardia. The elevated calcium levels in the urine suggest that there may be increased bone turnover, which can be seen in hyperthyroidism. Familial hypercalcemic hypocalciuria and hyperparathyroidism would have normal or low urinary calcium levels, while sarcoidosis would present with other symptoms such as granulomas and erythema nodosum."

Additionally, the elevated serum calcium and urine calcium level support this diagnosis as hyperthyroidism can increase bone resorption and lead to hypercalcemia. Familial hypercalcemic hypocalciuria typically presents with asymptomatic hypercalcemia and hypocalciuria, while hyperparathyroidism and sarcoidosis are less likely given the patient's clinical presentation."
