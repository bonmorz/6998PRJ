The patient's hemoglobin, hematocrit, and MCV indicate megaloblastic anemia, which is most commonly caused by a deficiency in folate or vitamin B12. However, the MCV is high, which is more indicative of folate deficiency. Additionally, the patient's diet consisting of packaged and canned foods may be lacking in fresh fruits and vegetables, which are sources of folate. Therefore, folate deficiency is the most likely deficiency."

Folate deficiency can cause macrocytic anemia, whereas B12 and thiamine deficiencies can cause microcytic anemia. Zinc deficiency can cause iron-deficiency anemia, but the lab values show normal iron levels. Therefore, the most likely deficiency is folate. The patient's diet consisting of packaged foods and canned meats also supports the possibility of a folate deficiency."

However, vitamin B12 deficiency is less common in elderly people who are not strict vegetarians, so folate deficiency is the most likely deficiency in this case.

The patient\u2019s diet consisting of packaged foods and canned meats may be deficient in folate.
