The laboratory studies show a low hemoglobin level and thrombocytopenia, which are common in acute myeloid leukemia. The presence of crackles in the left lower lobe area indicates pulmonary involvement. Enlarged lymph nodes in the axillary and cervical regions on both sides along with petechiae and purpura also suggest acute myeloid leukemia. Option B, Burkitt lymphoma, presents with rapidly-growing tumors, while option D, small cell lung cancer, presents with a history of smoking and cough. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (option C) is unlikely to present with petechiae and purpura. Thus, option A is the most likely diagnosis for this patient."
