The patient has a history of weight loss, constipation, and bloating, which are symptoms of gastrointestinal cancer. The positive stool test for occult blood suggests the possibility of colorectal cancer. The liver is palpable and has a hard, mildly tender nodule, which may be indicative of metastatic spread from the cancer. The CT scan shows multiple hepatic lesions, which also support a diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer. Hepatic echinococcal cysts usually present as well-defined lesions and do not cause weight loss or positive stool tests for occult blood. Cholangiocarcinoma is also unlikely because the patient has not presented with jaundice or biochemical abnormalities suggestive of cholestasis. Cirrhosis is not a likely diagnosis due to the presence of the hepatic nodules and the absence of typical risk factors like alcohol abuse or viral hepatitis."
