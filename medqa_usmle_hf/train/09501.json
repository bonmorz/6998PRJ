Abnormal esophageal manometry would confirm this diagnosis and help distinguish between different types of motility disorders such as achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasms, or nutcracker esophagus. Abnormal coronary angiogram would show blockages in the coronary arteries, which is unlikely given the patient's symptoms. Abnormal esophageal biopsy may be suggestive of inflammatory conditions such as eosinophilic esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus but would not necessarily be the most expected finding. Abnormal pulmonary function tests may be seen in patients with lung disease, but the patient denies dyspnea on exertion, making it less likely."

Abnormal esophageal biopsy is possible but less likely than an abnormal esophageal manometry as biopsy is used to diagnose esophageal mucosal disease."

This can help to confirm the diagnosis of GERD and guide appropriate management options.
