Bronchiectasis is caused by impaired mucociliary clearance, which is driven by cilia and their movement facilitated by dynein. Dynein is responsible for the sliding movement of adjacent microtubule doublets in ciliary and flagellar structures. Therefore, the impairment of dynein function can result in the development of bronchiectasis."
