The tuberculin skin test (PPD) is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction mediated by T cells, particularly Th1 cells, and not by opsonization, complement activation, or IgE cross-linking. The skin test involves the injection of purified protein derivative (PPD) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and an area of induration at the site of injection is interpreted as a positive reaction indicating previous sensitization to the bacterium."
