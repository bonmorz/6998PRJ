The patient\u2019s history and symptoms suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is consistent with a 70-pack-year smoking history and chronic cough. Bilateral wheezing and flattened diaphragms on chest X-ray also support this diagnosis. In COPD, FEV1: FVC is decreased as a result of airway obstruction, and total lung capacity is increased due to air trapping. Therefore, answer choice (B) is likely to be seen with pulmonary function testing."

The symptoms and the patient's history suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which is typically associated with decreased FEV1: FVC and increased total lung capacity. Flattening of the diaphragm bilaterally on chest X-ray is also consistent with COPD. Option A is incorrect as it suggests increased FEV1: FVC which is not commonly seen in COPD. Option C suggests normal total lung capacity, which is also not common in COPD. Option D suggests decreased total lung capacity, which is not consistent with flattening of the diaphragm bilaterally on chest X-ray."

Coarse wheezing on physical examination is consistent with obstructive lung disease. The pulmonary function testing is likely to show decreased FEV1:FVC, which is a hallmark of obstructive lung diseases like COPD, and increased total lung capacity, which can also occur in COPD due to the destruction of lung tissue. Option (B) is correct."
