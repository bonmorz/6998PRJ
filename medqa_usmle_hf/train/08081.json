Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the most appropriate drug for this patient, work by inhibiting the ATPase enzyme in the gastric parietal cells, which reduces the production of stomach acid and thus helps to heal the erosions in the esophagus. Option A is incorrect because PPIs do not enhance the mucosal barrier. Option B is irrelevant because D2 receptors are not involved in acid production. Option C is incorrect because H2 blockers, not PPIs, work by inhibiting H2 receptors."
