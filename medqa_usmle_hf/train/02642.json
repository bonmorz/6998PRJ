The patient is involved in repetitive shoulder motion which suggest Myositis ossificans, the formation of bone tissue within muscle tissue due to repetitive stress. The location of the mass on the deltopectoral groove is also consistent with this diagnosis. Osteoid osteoma would cause bone pain, not a mass, while a lipoma would be soft and not tender to palpation. Acromioclavicular joint separation usually causes separation of the clavicle from the acromion, not a mass in the deltopectoral groove."

The patient\u2019s history suggests repetitive use injury, and the firm mass and limited range of motion indicate myositis ossificans, which is a calcification of a muscle due to repetitive microtrauma. Osteoid osteoma can also cause localized pain but it is not associated with a firm mass. Lipomas are usually soft and don\u2019t cause pain. Acromioclavicular joint separation would most likely present with pain in the acromioclavicular joint rather than the deltopectoral groove."
