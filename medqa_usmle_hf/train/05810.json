The patient's physical exam and history suggest that he is recovering well from his appendectomy, and his urine analysis suggests proteinuria and mild leukocyturia. The absence of bacteria and nitrites rules out a urinary tract infection. The next step would be to perform a urine dipstick in the morning and in the afternoon to see if proteinuria is persistent or transient. This can distinguish between orthostatic and persistent proteinuria. Basic metabolic panel and urine electrolytes and creatinine may be useful in diagnosing certain conditions but not necessary in this case. Renal biopsy is not indicated at this point as the patient is recovering well and presents no significant symptoms."

The best next step in management is to repeat the urine dipstick in the morning and in the afternoon to confirm or rule out proteinuria, and to ensure that the patient is properly hydrated. Options A and D are not necessary at this time, and a renal biopsy is not indicated without further evaluation."
