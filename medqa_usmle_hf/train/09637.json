The patient's symptoms, including difficulty with social interactions, repetitive behaviors, and obsessive interests, suggest a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.

Tourette's syndrome is characterized by involuntary vocalizations and motor tics, which are not present in this case. Obsessive-compulsive disorder may involve repetitive behaviors, but the patient's difficulty with social interactions and communication are not typical of this condition.

The speech characteristics suggest mild language impairment, which is also seen in Autism spectrum disorder. The patient does not display any vocal tics or involuntary movements, which rule out Tourette's syndrome. The presence of tantrums and difficulty responding to rewards and punishment suggest Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, but this diagnosis is less likely as it does not match with the other symptoms displayed. Level 1 Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by mild symptoms of impaired social communication, repetitive behavior, and interests."
