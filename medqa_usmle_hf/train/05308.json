The question is asking about the first immunologic process that occurred, which is related to the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. The correct answer is B - replication of bacteria within alveolar macrophages. After initial infection, M. tuberculosis enters alveolar macrophages and replicates until the host immune system is activated. This leads to the production of interferon-gamma by T-helper cells, which activates macrophages to kill the bacteria, and the formation of a nodular tubercle in the lung. Migration of T-helper cells to the lungs occurs in response to the bacterial replication and activation of the immune response."
