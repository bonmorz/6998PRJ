The patient's symptoms (muscle rigidity, decreased reflexes, increased creatine kinase) suggest neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a rare but serious side effect of antipsychotic medications like fluphenazine. Therefore, the correct answer is (B). Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant, which does not have significant muscle-related side effects. Methamphetamine is a CNS stimulant that can cause hyperthermia, but it is not commonly associated with muscle rigidity. Tranylcypromine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor used to treat depression and anxiety, and it is also not associated with muscle rigidity."
