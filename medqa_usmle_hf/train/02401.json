The patient presents with fever, chills, vomiting, and severe tenderness in the right lower quadrant and flank, along with leukocytosis and pyuria on urine analysis. These symptoms and lab findings suggest the most likely diagnosis is pyelonephritis, which is a bacterial infection of the renal pelvis and kidney. The history of egg salad consumption and sexual activity with inconsistent condom use also raise concerns for other possible infections, but the presence of flank tenderness and pyuria make pyelonephritis the most likely diagnosis. Ovarian torsion, gastroenteritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease do not typically present with such symptoms and lab results."

The patient\u2019s symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a urinary tract infection that has now progressed to pyelonephritis, given the fever and flank pain. The presence of leukocyte esterase and RBCs in the urine also supports this diagnosis. The other options, including ovarian torsion, do not explain the urinary symptoms and laboratory findings."

The presence of leukocyte esterase and the high number of white blood cells in the urine support this diagnosis. Ovarian torsion can also cause severe abdominal pain but is less likely given the absence of abnormal findings on pelvic examination. Pelvic inflammatory disease is a possibility, but the absence of cervical motion tenderness suggests otherwise. Gastroenteritis is also a possibility but is less likely given the absence of diarrhea and the presence of urinary symptoms. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is pyelonephritis."
