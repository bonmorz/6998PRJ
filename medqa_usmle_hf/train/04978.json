Jugular venous distension is a classic sign of cardiac tamponade. Decreased systolic blood pressure with inspiration is a sign of paradoxical pulse, which is also seen in cardiac tamponade.

Decreased systolic blood pressure with inspiration can be a sign of cardiac tamponade, but it is not the most likely finding in this patient. Unequal blood pressure measurements between both arms and warm extremities are not typically observed in cardiac tamponade."

The patient's symptoms, including shortness of breath, swelling of her legs, and weakness, suggest that she may have heart failure. The pericardial friction rub is a sign of pericarditis, which can be caused by SLE. The electrocardiogram findings suggest acute pericarditis with pericardial effusion, which can lead to cardiac tamponade. The clinical finding that is most likely to be found in this patient is jugular venous distension, which is a sign of cardiac tamponade. This occurs when the pericardial effusion increases to the point where it compresses the heart and impairs cardiac function, leading to decreased cardiac output and hypotension. Other signs of cardiac tamponade include muffled heart sounds and pulsus paradoxus, which is a decrease in systolic blood pressure by more than 10 mmHg with inspiration."
