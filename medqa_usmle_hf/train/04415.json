The ventral and dorsal pancreatic ducts arise from the fusion of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds during embryological development. Therefore, the failure of fusion between the two buds leads to the presence of both ducts in the adult pancreas. Option (C) is correct. Notochord signaling is involved in the development of the neural tube, and apoptosis and stem cell differentiation are not directly related to the fusion of the pancreatic buds."

Failure of this fusion process leads to the presence of both dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts, known as pancreas divisum. Therefore, option (C) Fusion is the correct answer.
