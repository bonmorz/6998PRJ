The presentation of weakness and tingling in the 4th and 5th digits, weakened grip strength, and weakness of finger adduction and abduction suggest ulnar neuropathy. The fact that it is worse at the end of a long workout suggests compression at the elbow (cubital tunnel). Guyon's canal compression would present with sensory changes in the 5th digit and weakness of the intrinsic muscles of the hand. Carpal tunnel syndrome would present with sensory changes in the median nerve distribution and weakness in the thenar muscles. Posterior interosseous nerve compression would present with weakness of wrist extension and finger extension."

Anabolic steroid use can increase the risk of nerve compression. The weakness of grip strength and finger adduction and abduction are also consistent with cubital tunnel compression. Guyon's canal compression involves the ulnar nerve at the wrist, carpal tunnel syndrome involves the median nerve, and posterior interosseous nerve compression involves the deep branch of the radial nerve."

The loss of sensation over the volar surface of the 4th and 5th digits and medial aspect of the volar forearm, along with weakness of finger adduction and abduction, suggest Cubital tunnel compression. This is further supported by the patient's history of anabolic steroid use, which can cause muscle weakness and nerve compression. Guyon's canal compression would typically present with sensory loss over the 4th and 5th digits and weakness or atrophy of hand muscles. Carpal tunnel syndrome would typically present with sensory loss and weakness in the thumb, index, and middle fingers. Posterior interosseous nerve compression would usually present with weakness of wrist and finger extension, but not grip strength."

The symptoms, specifically the loss of sensation and weakness in the 4th and 5th digits, suggest a nerve compression syndrome. Among the options, cubital tunnel compression is the most likely diagnosis as it affects the ulnar nerve, which supplies the 4th and 5th digits and can be compressed in bodybuilders due to muscular hypertrophy. The other options do not typically cause these specific symptoms."

The loss of sensation over the volar surface of the 4th and 5th digits and over the medial aspect of the volar forearm are consistent with ulnar nerve distribution. The weakness of finger adduction and abduction, and the grip strength loss are also consistent with ulnar nerve compression. Anabolic steroid use can increase muscle mass and lead to compression of nerves, thus increasing the likelihood of cubital tunnel syndrome. Guyon's canal compression affects the ulnar nerve as well, but it would not explain the additional symptoms of finger adduction and abduction weakness. Carpal tunnel syndrome affects the median nerve, and posterior interosseous nerve compression would not cause sensation loss over the volar surface of the forearm."
