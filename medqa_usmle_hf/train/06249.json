Rh(D) alloimmunization can occur if a woman who is Rh negative carries a baby who is Rh positive, which can occur if the father is Rh positive. If the baby\u2019s Rh-positive blood enters the mother\u2019s bloodstream (which can happen during delivery or other pregnancy-related procedures), the mother\u2019s immune system may start producing Rh antibodies that can attack the baby\u2019s red blood cells. This can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn, which can cause anemia, jaundice, brain damage, and even death. Rho(D) immune globulin can prevent the mother\u2019s immune system from producing Rh antibodies, and is recommended for Rh-negative women who are pregnant with Rh-positive babies. The injection will not protect against other Rh antigens aside from Rh(D). Refusing the injection can put the baby at risk of developing hemolytic disease of the newborn."

The injection is recommended to be given at 28 weeks of pregnancy, and also after delivery if the baby is Rh(D) positive. The injection only protects against the Rh(D) antigen specifically, not other Rh antigens.
