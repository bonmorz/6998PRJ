The spontaneous milky-white nipple discharge suggests hyperprolactinemia, which is most commonly caused by a pituitary adenoma. Pituitary adenomas can suppress FSH and LH secretion, leading to decreased ovarian function and menstrual irregularities.

The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible pituitary adenoma, which can cause hyperprolactinemia and disrupt the normal secretion of other pituitary hormones. The expected laboratory results would be increased prolactin and decreased FSH and LH, as high levels of prolactin can suppress the production of gonadotropins.
