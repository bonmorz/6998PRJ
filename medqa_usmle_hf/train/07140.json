The scenario presented in the question suggests that the fetus is experiencing fetal distress, as evidenced by the deceleration of the fetal heart rate during contractions. Among the options, fetal head compression is the most likely cause of this finding, as the vertex is at -1 station and the cervix is fully dilated, suggesting that the fetal head is engaged in the pelvis and is likely causing pressure on the umbilical cord. Placental insufficiency and fetal myocardial depression would likely result in a nonreactive fetal heart rate, while umbilical cord compression would result in late decelerations on the CTG."

The scenario describes a typical case of pushing during the second stage of labor, and fetal heart rate decreases suggest compression of the fetal head during delivery. Placental insufficiency and umbilical cord compression may cause fetal heart rate abnormalities during the first stage of labor or later on, but not during the pushing stage. Fetal myocardial depression is less common than fetal head compression and is usually associated with other abnormalities such as meconium-stained amniotic fluid or maternal hypertension."
