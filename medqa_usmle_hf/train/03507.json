Oral Penicillin V would not be sufficient, and outpatient follow-up is not appropriate for this severe presentation. Azithromycin and Levofloxacin are alternatives for those allergic to penicillin or unable to tolerate it, but treatment should still be inpatient."

The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and chest pain, along with physical exam findings of crackles and gram-positive diplococci in the sputum, suggest community-acquired pneumonia. Given the patient's age, vital signs, and confusion, he should be admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous penicillin G as the most appropriate management. Oral Penicillin V is not reliable in treating pneumonia, and outpatient follow-up is not appropriate for a patient with severe symptoms and gram-positive diplococci in their sputum. Azithromycin and levofloxacin are both options for treating pneumonia, but IV penicillin G is preferred in this case."
