The patient has a weak cry, moderate muscle tone with some flexion, and blue extremities, indicating a low Apgar score. Positive pressure ventilation is recommended for infants with an Apgar score of less than 7 at 5 minutes after birth. Chest compressions are not recommended unless the heart rate is less than 60 beats/min after positive pressure ventilation. Supplemental oxygen can be given, but positive pressure ventilation is the first-line treatment for low Apgar score. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are not indicated unless positive pressure ventilation is ineffective."
