The lack of hair on the chest and axillae and the presence of vascular lesions suggest liver disease, specifically cirrhosis. This is because the liver plays a role in the metabolism of estrogen and testosterone, and cirrhosis can lead to an increase in estrogen levels relative to testosterone levels, leading to gynecomastia. Chronic kidney disease and hyperthyroidism can also cause gynecomastia, but they are less likely in this case given the other symptoms and physical exam findings. Physiologic gynecomastia is seen in newborns, adolescents, and aging men, and is not applicable to this patient."
