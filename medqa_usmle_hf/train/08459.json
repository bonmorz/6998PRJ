The presence of bradycardia and prolongation of PR and QT intervals suggest the use of a Class III anti-arrhythmic drug, such as sotalol, which has beta-blocker properties that can lead to bradycardia. Carvedilol and propranolol are beta-blockers, but they are not Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs. Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker, which can lead to AV block but not necessarily bradycardia or QT prolongation."
