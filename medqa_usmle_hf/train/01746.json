The symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, which can cause pneumonia and sepsis. A deficiency in bacterial clearance, such as a deficiency in complement proteins or neutrophils, can contribute to an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. Immunoglobulin A action is important in mucosal immunity, but this infection is not likely to be solely caused by a deficiency in this type of antibody. Respiratory burst is important in phagocytosis, but it is not the most likely contributor to this patient's infection. T cell differentiation is important in cell-mediated immunity, but it is not the most likely contributor to this patient's infection."
