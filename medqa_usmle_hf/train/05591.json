The patient\u2019s symptoms and medical history suggest pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and possibly preeclampsia. The elevated blood pressure and abdominal tenderness suggest liver involvement, making serum transaminase levels and platelet count the most appropriate next step in management. Serum bile acid levels are also useful for PIH and preeclampsia, but they are not mentioned in the answer options. Stool antigen assay for H. pylori is not useful in this scenario. Reassurance and follow-up are appropriate for mild cases of PIH, but the patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a more severe case."
