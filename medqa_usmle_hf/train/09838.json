Based on the information given, the amount of drug in the body is 150 mg, and the plasma drug concentration after 20 minutes is 2.5 mcg/mL or 0.0025 mg/mL. Converting the units, we have 150 mg/0.0025 mg/mL = 60,000 mL or 60 L, which is closest to option (A). Therefore, the volume of distribution of the administered drug is approximately 60 L."

Volume of distribution (Vd) is the theoretical volume that would be necessary to contain the total amount of an administered drug at the same concentration that it is observed in the blood plasma. Knowing that concentration (C) = amount of drug (A) / Vd, we can calculate Vd as Vd = A / C. In this case, the amount of drug given is 150 mg = 0.15 g and the concentration observed after 20 minutes is 2.5 mcg/mL = 0.0025 mg/mL. Therefore, C = 0.0025 mg/mL and A = 0.15 g. Plugging these values into the formula, we get Vd = 0.15 g / 0.0025 mg/mL = 60 L. Thus, the answer is (A)."
