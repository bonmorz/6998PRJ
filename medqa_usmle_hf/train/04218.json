Her previous normal colonoscopy is still adequate for colon cancer screening as current recommendations suggest screening every 10 years starting at age 50. Repeat pap smear is also not indicated at this time since she has negative results in the previous two years. Serum HIV testing is not indicated since her previous testing was negative, she does not have any risk factors, and this is not a routine recommendation for all patients. In the absence of any significant new health concerns, reassurance is the most appropriate recommendation at this time."

Fecal occult blood test is recommended every 1-2 years starting at age 50, but considering the patient\u2019s normal colonoscopy 6 years ago, it may not be necessary at this time.
