The guidelines recommend placing infants to sleep on their backs on a firm, empty surface free of soft objects or loose bedding, using pacifiers after 1 month of age, and avoiding smoking during and after pregnancy. Bumpers, pillows, and blankets are not recommended as they may increase the risk of suffocation. Home apnea monitors are not recommended for routine use. Option (A) combines these recommendations and is the correct answer."

The use of a pacifier after 1 month of age has also been shown to reduce the risk of SIDS. The use of bumpers, head propped up on a pillow, and wrapped in a warm blanket or infant sleeper are not recommended as they increase the risk of suffocation and SIDS.
