The symptoms and CT scan showing an intimal flap limited to the descending aorta suggest the diagnosis of aortic dissection. Intravenous opioid analgesia can help to manage the pain, but further management should involve blood pressure control to prevent extension of the dissection, which can lead to rupture or other complications. Intravenous esmolol is a beta-blocker that can reduce heart rate and blood pressure, and is the best next step in management for this patient. Emergency surgical intervention may be necessary in some cases but is not the best initial step. Oral medications like metoprolol and enalapril are not appropriate for emergency management of aortic dissection. Nitroglycerin is not effective for this type of condition."
