The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome, which is compression of the median nerve in the wrist. Tingling when the wrist is percussed, also known as Tinel\u2019s sign, is a classic finding in carpal tunnel syndrome. Hairline fracture of the scaphoid bone on MRI would indicate a wrist injury but not necessarily carpal tunnel syndrome. Small cross-sectional area of the median nerve on ultrasonography may be seen in carpal tunnel syndrome, but it is not a definitive diagnostic finding. Tingling when the wrists are extended 90 degrees is known as Phalen\u2019s sign and may also be seen in carpal tunnel syndrome, but it is not as specific as Tinel\u2019s sign."

Option C, which is the Tinel sign, is a useful clinical test for CTS. It involves percussing the transverse carpal ligament and produces symptoms of pain and tingling in the median nerve distribution. Option A is a possibility but MRI may not be practical for a pregnant patient. Option B may be helpful but ultrasound examination is operator-dependent. Option D is part of Phalen sign, which is another clinical test for CTS, but it is not as sensitive as Tinel sign."
