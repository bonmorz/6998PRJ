Insulin antagonism of human placental lactogen (HPL) is the leading hypothesis of GDM pathogenesis. HPL is a hormone produced by the placenta during pregnancy, which has a structural similarity to growth hormone and prolactin. It is well established that HPL has an insulin-antagonistic effect, and it is thought that high HPL levels in GDM lead to insulin resistance. Autoantibodies against pancreatic beta cells and point mutations in the insulin gene are common causes of type 1 diabetes, which is not the same as GDM. Decrease in insulin gene expression is not implicated in GDM pathogenesis."
