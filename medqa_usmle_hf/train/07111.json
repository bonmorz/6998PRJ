Therefore, the most likely substance to be elevated in this patient is 11-deoxycorticosterone. Options A and B are enzymes involved in the production of cortisol and aldosterone, which are not elevated in this patient. Option C is an enzyme involved in the production of thyroid hormones and is not relevant to this case."

The high serum testosterone suggests that the patient may have an androgen-secreting tumor. Among the options, 11-deoxycorticosterone is most likely to be elevated in this patient, as it is a precursor to aldosterone and is elevated in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. This condition can lead to hypertension and androgen excess."
