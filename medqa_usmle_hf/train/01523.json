The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest Bartter Syndrome, which is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved with sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter in the loop of Henle in the kidney. The co-transporter is the target of loop diuretics such as furosemide and thiazide diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide. Therefore, the protein that binds the drug that is most likely causing the patient\u2019s symptoms is the sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic and is therefore the correct answer."

The symptoms, especially the muscle cramps and fatigue, suggest that the patient has Bartter syndrome, which is associated with mutations in the Na-K-2Cl co-transporter. Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, can be used to treat this condition as it blocks the sodium-chloride co-transporter in the distal convoluted tubule, leading to increased sodium delivery to the collecting duct and increased potassium retention. Therefore, the protein involved in this condition and which binds hydrochlorothiazide is the Na-K-2Cl co-transporter."
