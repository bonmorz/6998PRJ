The elevated cortisol levels and lack of response to low dose dexamethasone suppression test suggest Cushing's syndrome. The ACTH level suggests that it is due to a pituitary adenoma, but normal pituitary gland imaging suggests it may be an ectopic ACTH-secreting tumor. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling can help localize the source of ACTH secretion. Pulmonary nodule resection is not indicated as the nodule is asymptomatic and appears benign. Repeat high dose dexamethasone suppression test is not necessary as it has already been responsive. Pituitary resection can be considered if the source is confirmed to be a pituitary adenoma."

Pituitary resection is an option if there is a pituitary adenoma causing hypercortisolism, but the imaging results do not support this. Pulmonary nodule resection is not indicated unless the nodule is large enough to cause concern for cancer.

The patient's symptoms are suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, with elevated urinary and serum cortisol levels and a non-responsive low-dose dexamethasone suppression test.

Imaging revealed a calcified pulmonary nodule but no pituitary or adrenal gland abnormalities. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling is the next step in distinguishing whether the source of ACTH secretion is pituitary or ectopic."
