AMA is a test used to diagnose primary biliary cholangitis, an autoimmune disease of the liver that can cause cholestasis. MRCP may be useful to identify biliary tract obstruction, but the ultrasonogram suggests no abnormality. ERCP is an invasive diagnostic procedure that may cause pancreatitis, so it should not be used as the first step. Anti smooth muscle antibody is useful to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis, but the AMA test is more specific for primary biliary cholangitis. Therefore, the next best step is to perform an AMA test."

ERCP and MRCP are imaging studies that may be helpful in diagnosing biliary obstruction but are not indicated at this time.
