The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE), which can lead to hypoxemia, tachycardia, and accentuation of P2. The right calf swelling and warmth suggest deep vein thrombosis, which is a risk factor for PE. In PE, there is a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion, and the V/Q ratio is usually elevated, resulting in a higher ratio than normal. Answer choice (B) is the only one that represents an elevated V/Q ratio, which corresponds to a PE."

The presentation of shortness of breath, dry cough, and accentuation of P2 with an S3 gallop suggests pulmonary embolism. The swelling and warmth over the right calf also indicate a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The most likely V/Q ratio corresponding to this patient\u2019s condition is 1.3, which indicates a high probability of pulmonary embolism. This is because there is a decrease in the amount of air reaching the alveoli due to obstruction of the pulmonary vasculature, leading to ventilation without perfusion."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a possible pulmonary embolism (PE), which occurs when there is a partial or complete blockage of blood flow in the lungs. An elevated P2 and S3 gallop are signs of right ventricular strain, which can occur due to increased pressure in the pulmonary artery from a PE. A V/Q scan is a diagnostic test used to assess the ventilation to perfusion ratio in the lungs. In a normal lung, the ratio is 1. In a patient with a PE, the ratio will be increased, with ventilation being greater than perfusion. Option (B) corresponds to an increased V/Q ratio, which is the most likely ratio in a patient with a PE."
