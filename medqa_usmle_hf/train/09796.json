The presentation suggests meningitis, and the fact that the patient recently traveled to Haiti suggests a possible bacterial cause such as meningococcal meningitis. The polysaccharide conjugate vaccine is most effective in preventing meningococcal meningitis. Fluconazole therapy would not be effective against bacterial infections. The inactivated whole-cell and toxoid vaccines are used for prevention of different types of bacterial infections (pertussis and tetanus, respectively) and would not prevent meningococcal meningitis."
