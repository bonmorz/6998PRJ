The patient\u2019s symptoms, spleen size, and peripheral blood smear suggest the diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). CML is characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome, a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, which results in the fusion gene BCR-ABL1. Therefore, the laboratory studies are most likely to show the Philadelphia chromosome as a confirmatory test for CML. Auer rods are seen in acute myeloid leukemia, JAK2 mutation is seen in myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera, and translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17 is seen in acute promyelocytic leukemia."

Together, these findings strongly suggest a diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome translocation. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). Auer rods are seen in acute myeloid leukemia, JAK2 mutation is associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms including polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, and translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17 is seen in acute promyelocytic leukemia."
