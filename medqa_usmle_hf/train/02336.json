The patient\u2019s lower extremity edema is a sign of significant fluid retention, likely due to an underlying medical condition such as heart failure or hypoalbuminemia from malnutrition. This, along with the irregular heartbeat and PVCs, suggests a high risk for cardiovascular complications and warrants inpatient hospitalization. The other options, while concerning, are not as immediately life-threatening as the edema and cardiac symptoms."

A low BMI could also be concerning for anorexia nervosa, but the patient\u2019s BMI has improved from 6 months ago and is relatively stable. The presence of PVCs with bigeminy is worrisome but not as urgent as the lower extremity edema and heart rhythm irregularities.
