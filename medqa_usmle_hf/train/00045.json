The combination of symptoms and signs (fever, nausea and vomiting, difficulty breathing, muscle twitching) suggests the most likely diagnosis is tetanus. Tetanus is caused by Clostridium tetani bacteria which spores can be found in soil, dust, and animal feces, and can enter the body through puncture wounds, burns, or any break in the skin. Spelunking or exploring caves is a risk factor for tetanus as the potential for injury and exposure to contaminated objects is higher. Contaminated beef can lead to foodborne illnesses but it is not a common cause of tetanus. Epiglottic cyst and mosquito bites are not risk factors for tetanus."
