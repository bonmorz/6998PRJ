Elevated anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies are associated with rheumatoid arthritis, and a positive interferon-gamma release assay indicates exposure to tuberculosis. Dilated bronchi on chest CT can be seen in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or bronchiectasis, but these findings are not associated with amyloidosis."
