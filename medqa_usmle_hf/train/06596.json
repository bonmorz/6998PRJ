The presence of dilated tortuous veins over the lower extremities and edema, along with the location of the ulcer above the medial left ankle, suggest venous insufficiency as the most likely cause of the ulcer. Peripheral neuropathy is commonly associated with diabetes, but is less likely to cause an oozing ulcer. Chronic pressure ulcers are usually located over bony prominences, and drug-induced microvascular occlusion is unlikely given the patient's medical history. The slight drooping of the right side of the face may indicate a previous stroke."

The yellow-brown spots and dilated tortuous veins over the lower extremities suggest venous insufficiency, which can cause ulceration. The patient's medical history and medications also make drug-induced microvascular occlusion less likely, and the absence of a history of trauma or pressure makes chronic pressure less likely as a cause. Peripheral neuropathy can cause foot ulcers, but the presentation in this patient is more consistent with venous insufficiency."
