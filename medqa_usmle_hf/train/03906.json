Therefore, urine toxicology is needed to identify the specific substance and guide further treatment.

Neither complete blood count nor thyroid stimulating hormone level are likely to provide helpful information in this case."

However, the fact that the patient remains agitated after being given haloperidol suggests that there may be other factors involved, such as drug intoxication. Therefore, the best next step would be to obtain a urine toxicology test to rule out any drug use or overdose that could be contributing to the patient\u2019s behavior. Assessing for suicidal ideation may be necessary at some point, but it is not the best next step in this case. Complete blood count and thyroid stimulating hormone levels are unlikely to be useful in this case."
