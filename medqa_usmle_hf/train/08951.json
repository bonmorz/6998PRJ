The patient\u2019s recent consumption of polar bear liver can lead to vitamin A toxicity, causing the symptoms described. Therefore, measuring plasma retinol levels can confirm the diagnosis. Antimitochondrial antibodies are associated with primary biliary cholangitis, while BRCA2 gene mutation is associated with breast and ovarian cancer. Elevated hepatic venous pressure gradient is associated with portal hypertension. None of these conditions are consistent with the patient\u2019s symptoms and history of polar bear liver consumption."

The patient likely has vitamin A toxicity from eating polar bear liver, which can cause symptoms such as skin changes, joint pain, and hepatosplenomegaly. Plasma retinol levels can confirm this diagnosis. Antimitochondrial antibodies are associated with primary biliary cholangitis, which presents with elevated alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels, but the patient does not have other symptoms of this condition. BRCA2 gene mutation is associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer, but it is not relevant to the current presentation. Elevated hepatic venous pressure gradient is seen in conditions such as cirrhosis and portal hypertension, but the patient does not have other features of these conditions."
