The patient's symptoms suggest the possibility of hepatitis C infection due to the purpuric papules, fatigue, and joint pain. In addition, the decreased complement levels and positive rheumatoid factor indicate a possible autoimmune component. Therefore, hepatitis C serology would be the most appropriate next step in management to confirm or rule out infection with hepatitis C virus, which can contribute to mixed cryoglobulinemia and autoimmune disorders."

The positive rheumatoid factor and decreased complement levels also point to this possibility. The increased gammaglobulins and normal urine analysis suggest a non-renal cause of elevated gammaglobulins, such as Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia or multiple myeloma. However, since the patient has purpuric lesions, hepatitis C serology is the most appropriate next step in management as it is associated with cryoglobulinemia, which can cause purpura in patients with autoimmune diseases. Rapid plasma reagin tests are used to detect syphilis, while pANCA assays are used to detect vasculitis. Bence Jones protein tests are used to detect multiple myeloma."
