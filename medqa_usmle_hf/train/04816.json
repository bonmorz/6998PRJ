The patient\u2019s symptoms are suggestive of HIV-associated central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, as indicated by the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis, and PCR positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. The weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders on MRI is also typical of CNS lymphoma. AIDS dementia is a possibility but would typically present with more diffuse involvement of the white matter. Cerebral toxoplasmosis and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy are also possibilities but would typically present with multiple lesions on MRI."

This patient has a history of HIV infection, a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing lymphocytic predominant pleocytosis. The MRI shows a solitary, weakly ring-enhancing lesion with well-defined borders involving the corpus callosum. These findings are consistent with primary cerebral lymphoma, which is a common central nervous system malignancy in HIV-infected individuals. Other options such as AIDS dementia, cerebral toxoplasmosis, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy can also occur in HIV-infected individuals, but the clinical presentation and imaging findings in this case are more suggestive of primary cerebral lymphoma."
