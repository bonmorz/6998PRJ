An EEG would be more helpful if the patient had a history of seizures. Serum toxicology would be warranted if there were concerns of drug overdose or poisoning, but there is no indication for that in this case. Echocardiography would be more helpful if there were concerns of structural heart disease, but there is no indication for that in this case."
