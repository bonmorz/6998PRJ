The low hematocrit, erythrocyte count, and thrombocyte count, along with the crinkled-paper appearance of macrophages, suggest that this patient has Gaucher disease. \u03b2-glucosidase is the deficient enzyme in Gaucher disease. This enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of a glycolipid called glucocerebroside, which is abundant in spleen and liver macrophages."
