Abnormal hemoglobin can be caused by different mutations, but the most common one is a missense mutation where a single nucleotide change results in the substitution of one amino acid in the hemoglobin protein chain. This leads to the production of an abnormal hemoglobin that can undergo polymerization. Splice site mutations affect the processing of RNA and do not directly affect the amino acid sequence of the protein. Frameshift mutations result from the insertion or deletion of nucleotides and cause a disruption in the reading frame of the gene, leading to a drastically altered protein. Silent mutations do not result in an amino acid change since they occur in regions of the gene that do not code for the protein or in regions where the change in the nucleotide sequence does not affect the amino acid sequence."

The condition described is sickle cell anemia, which involves a point mutation (a type of missense mutation) in the HBB gene that encodes the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin. This mutation results in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at position 6 of the beta-globin chain, leading to abnormal hemoglobin that can polymerize under certain conditions. Frameshift and splice site mutations can also cause genetic disorders, but they are less likely to be responsible for sickle cell anemia.
