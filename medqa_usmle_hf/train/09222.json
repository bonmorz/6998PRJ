The patient has a history of hypertension and his blood pressure is elevated, which suggests that arterial hypertension is the most likely underlying cause of his condition. The symptoms of shortness of breath, weight gain, jugular venous distention, and edema in the lower legs are consistent with heart failure, which can be caused by chronic hypertension leading to concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle. The late-diastolic heart sound suggests mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation, which can be secondary to long-standing hypertension. The patient's history of alcoholic steatosis and daily alcohol intake may also contribute to his hypertension and heart failure. None of the other options specifically fit with the patient's clinical presentation and history."

The late-diastolic heart sound suggests left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, which is often seen in hypertensive heart disease. The echocardiography also shows hypertrophy of the left ventricle, which is another common finding in hypertensive heart disease. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is possible but less likely given the patient's short history of alcohol consumption and lack of previous symptoms. Pericardial effusion and flow reversal of ventricular shunt are less likely given the absence of pertinent findings on physical examination or imaging."
