The drug is a selective muscarinic receptor agonist on the M3 subtype, which is involved in the activation of phospholipase C. This leads to the second messenger, inositol triphosphate (IP3), which increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration, causing bladder smooth muscle contraction and relaxation of the urethral sphincter, allowing for urination. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and guanylyl cyclase lead to decreased intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, respectively, and increased transmembrane K+ conductance would cause hyperpolarization and reduced excitability, which are not mechanisms involved in urinary bladder contraction."

Activation of M3 receptors leads to the activation of phospholipase C, which in turn leads to the production of inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds to receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, causing the release of calcium ions, which leads to muscle contraction. In this case, activation of M3 receptors in the bladder smooth muscle would lead to increased muscle tone and contraction, which would help overcome urinary bladder atony and improve bladder function."
