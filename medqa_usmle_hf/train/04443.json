The ATM gene is responsible for ataxia-telangiectasia, and the mutation causes a truncated protein. The last correctly incorporated amino acid is likely encoded by the tRNA anticodon that corresponds to the codon just before the mutation. The nonsense mutation causes premature termination of translation, and the tRNA that recognizes the codon at this position would be the one to contribute the last valid amino acid.

The question is asking us to determine the tRNA anticodon that corresponds to the last correctly incorporated amino acid in the ATM gene. The answer is 3'ACC5' because the ATM gene has a stop codon that corresponds to the anticodon 3'UUG5', which pairs with the anticodon 3'ACC5' on the tRNA. The question provides information about a nonsense mutation, which results in a premature stop codon and a truncated protein. The fact that the last correctly incorporated amino acid is not methionine is not relevant to this question."

The ATM gene codes for a protein involved in DNA repair, and mutations in this gene can lead to ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome. The C-terminal amino acid before the mutation is unknown, but we can use the given options to determine the most likely anticodon. The genetic code shows that UAC codes for tyrosine, AUC codes for isoleucine, and AUU codes for isoleucine. The last correctly incorporated amino acid is most likely the one that could be encoded by both AUC and AUU anticodons, which is isoleucine. The only option that includes isoleucine is option (C), which codes for isoleucine using the anticodon ACC. Therefore, the answer is (C)."

The correct answer can be deduced from the fact that the ATM gene mutation leads to a truncated protein with a different C-terminal amino acid. The mutation is a nonsense mutation, which means that an incorrect codon causes premature termination of translation. The last correctly incorporated amino acid can be determined by subtracting one from the number of amino acids in the truncated protein. The anticodon that codes for this amino acid must be the one that pairs with the codon immediately before the premature termination codon. Using this logic, we can eliminate options A and B because they code for isoleucine and tyrosine, respectively, which are not likely to be the last amino acid in the protein. Option D codes for isoleucine, which is a possible candidate, but option C codes for threonine, which is more likely to be the last amino acid before premature termination. Thus, option C is the correct answer."

The question is asking about the tRNA anticodon that corresponds to the last correctly incorporated amino acid in the truncated ATM protein. The ATM gene codes for a protein involved in DNA repair, and mutations in this gene can cause ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome, which is characterized by neurological and immune system dysfunction as well as increased risk of cancer. The mutation in this case is a nonsense mutation, which introduces a premature stop codon into the mRNA transcript and results in a truncated protein. The last correctly incorporated amino acid is the one immediately preceding the premature stop codon. To determine the tRNA anticodon that corresponds to this amino acid, we can look up the genetic code. The genetic code is a set of rules that relate the mRNA codons to the amino acids they encode, as well as to the tRNA molecules that carry those amino acids. Each tRNA molecule has a three-base anticodon sequence that is complementary to a specific mRNA codon, and the amino acid that the tRNA carries is determined by the genetic code. The question provides the 3' end of the tRNA anticodon and asks which of the provided options is most likely to correspond to the correctly incorporated amino acid. By consulting the genetic code, we can see that the anticodon 3'ACC5' corresponds to the amino acid threonine. Therefore, the correct answer is (C)."
