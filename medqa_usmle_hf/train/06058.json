When a person stands up, venous return decreases due to gravity pulling blood downwards, leading to a decrease in cardiac output and blood pressure. This triggers carotid sinus baroreceptors to decrease their activity, which further increases heart rate and blood pressure. Cerebral blood flow decreases due to the decrease in blood pressure. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) with a decrease in venous return, decrease in carotid sinus baroreceptor activity, and decrease in cerebral blood flow."
