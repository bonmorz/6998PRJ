The patient\u2019s increased thirst and urinary frequency, along with decreased skin turgor and elevated antidiuretic hormone levels, suggest an issue with water regulation. The serum sodium concentration is also elevated, which can be a result of excessive water intake. The most likely explanation for these findings is an adverse effect of a medication the patient is taking. The other options, such as a tumor of the pituitary gland or adrenal cortex, or paraneoplastic production of a hormone, are less likely based on the patient\u2019s symptoms and lab results."
