Option A is the most likely explanation for the normal physical examination findings, as transplacental transmission of thyroxine from the mother can help maintain normal levels of thyroid hormone despite the absence of a thyroid gland. Lingual thyroid tissue, molecular mimicry of hCG subunit, and production of TSH-receptor antibodies would not explain the absence of a thyroid gland."

The absence of both lobes of the thyroid gland would typically result in congenital hypothyroidism, but the patient's normal physical examination suggests that he has been receiving adequate amounts of thyroid hormone.
