The patient's breast engorgement indicates that there was adequate milk production at some point, which rules out option (A). The short course of cetirizine is unlikely to suppress lactation, ruling out option (B). Breast implants and a childhood chest trauma are also unlikely to be related to the patient's milk reduction. The history of switching to a mixed-feeding regimen and breast engorgement suggest that the patient is currently experiencing insufficient breast emptying, leading to a reduction in milk production. Therefore, the correct answer is (C)."

The patient\u2019s breast engorgement shortly after switching to formula indicates that she was producing enough milk before. The decrease in milk production is likely due to insufficient breast emptying, as she is not breastfeeding as often at work and her breasts are not being fully emptied. Medications and glandular breast tissue are not likely causes in this case, and failure of lactogenic ducts to develop would have been present since birth."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a decrease in milk production, and the absence of skin color changes and discharge on breast compression suggest that there are no anatomical abnormalities. Medications can suppress lactation, but the patient only had a short course of cetirizine which is unlikely to cause significant suppression. Breast implants and blunt chest trauma may affect lactation, but they cannot explain the sudden reduction of milk production. Insufficient breast emptying is the most likely cause, as switching to formula milk may affect milk production and breastfeeding frequency, leading to engorgement and ultimately decreased milk production."
