Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy can be caused by placenta previa, which involves the placenta extending over the internal cervical os. Smoking is a known risk factor for placenta previa, while oral contraceptive use and nulliparity have not been consistently associated with the condition. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) smoking."
