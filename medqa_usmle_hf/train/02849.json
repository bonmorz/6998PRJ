The image given shows a hypertrophic scar, characterized by excessive scar tissue projecting beyond the level of the surrounding skin, but not extending into the underlying subcutaneous tissue. Option A is incorrect because hypertrophic scars do not have hair follicles or other adnexal glands within them. Option C is incorrect because there may be a genetic predisposition to developing hypertrophic scars. Option D is incorrect because hypertrophic scars may extend beyond the borders of the traumatized area."

Keloids typically occur on the thorax, upper extremities, and earlobes and may occur in families. Option A is incorrect because keloids lack adnexal structures. Option C is incorrect because there is a genetic predisposition for keloid formation. Option D is incorrect because keloids can extend beyond the borders of traumatized areas."
