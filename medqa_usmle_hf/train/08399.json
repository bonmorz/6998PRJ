Since the urine did not respond to desmopressin, it is likely nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which is a possible side effect of the patient's mood stabilizer medication. Central diabetes insipidus is caused by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Primary polydipsia would lead to a high urine output with a low urine osmolarity, but it is not likely since the patient's urine did not increase in osmolarity after a water deprivation test. Urinary tract infection is not supported by the information provided."

The patient's symptoms and urine testing suggest diabetes insipidus, which is characterized by excessive thirst and frequent urination. The fact that urine osmolarity fails to increase after a water deprivation test and injection of desmopressin suggests either central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. However, the patient's use of a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder indicates that he may be experiencing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which can be a side effect of certain medications. Primary polydipsia is another possible cause, but it is less likely in this case given the patient's medication history. Urinary tract infection is not a likely cause of polyuria in this case."

The patient's low urine osmolarity and failure to increase after a water deprivation test and desmopressin injection suggest a problem with anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) secretion or action, which can be caused by central diabetes insipidus or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The long-term use of a mood stabilizer also points towards nephrogenic diabetes insipidus as a possible cause, as some medications can interfere with ADH activity in the kidney. Primary polydipsia and urinary tract infection are less likely causes given the patient's other symptoms and laboratory findings."
