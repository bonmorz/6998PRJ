The patient\u2019s recent history of hunting in eastern Europe suggests the possibility of trichinellosis, a parasitic infection that can be acquired by consuming undercooked meat from infected animals. Cooking meat to an internal temperature of 71\u00b0C (160\u00b0F) is the most effective way to prevent trichinellosis. Clean drinking water and pasteurized dairy products are important for preventing foodborne infections, but are not relevant in this case. Metronidazole is not effective against trichinellosis."
