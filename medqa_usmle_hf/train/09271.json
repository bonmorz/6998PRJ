The patient's history of a raw food diet and recent travel to Uganda put her at risk for niacin deficiency, which can cause intermittent diarrhea and a systolic ejection murmur. Low platelet count is not associated with these symptoms or risk factors. Hydrogen breath test would be more likely for lactose intolerance, which is a family history of the patient but not necessarily the current diagnosis. Decreased levels of chromogranin A may be seen in some cancers but is not specific to this patient's symptoms or risk factors."

The patient reports following a raw food diet for six months, which can lead to niacin deficiency due to the lack of proper sources of this vitamin. The new-onset systolic ejection murmur suggests a possible cardiac involvement, such as infective endocarditis or valvular dysfunction. Low platelet count is not typically associated with this presentation, and a positive hydrogen breath test is more indicative of lactose intolerance. Decreased levels of chromogranin A are seen in some neuroendocrine tumors, but there is no suggestion of this in the patient\u2019s presentation."

The systolic ejection murmur suggests infective endocarditis. A raw food diet may lead to niacin deficiency since most niacin in food is bound in carbohydrates and may be unavailable in a raw food diet. Therefore, answer (D) is the most likely. Low platelet count is a possible complication of infective endocarditis, but there is no indication that the patient has this complication. A positive hydrogen breath test is used to diagnose lactose intolerance, but the patient\u2019s symptoms do not suggest this diagnosis. Chromogranin A is a neuroendocrine marker and there is no indication that the patient has a neuroendocrine disorder."

Low platelets and positive hydrogen breath test are not typically associated with infective endocarditis, and chromogranin A levels are not relevant to this case. Therefore, niacin deficiency is the most likely development in this patient."
