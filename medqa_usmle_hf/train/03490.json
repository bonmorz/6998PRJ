The symptoms suggest a lysosomal storage disease, and the skeletal malformations, hepatosplenomegaly, and high plasma levels of lysosomal enzymes point to mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). Among the options, only Mannose-6-phosphate is associated with MPS, specifically MPS type I. It is responsible for targeting enzymes to lysosomes for degradation. In MPS type I, there is a deficiency in the enzyme required for adding Mannose-6-phosphate to the enzymes which leads to their accumulation in lysosomes."
