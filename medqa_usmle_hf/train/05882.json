The patient's symptoms of dysphagia, tooth pain, submandibular and anterior neck tenderness and swelling, and a decayed lower left third molar suggest Ludwig angina, a rapidly spreading cellulitis and abscess of the submandibular space. The leukocytosis and fever support this diagnosis. Lymphadenitis does not typically present with submandibular swelling, and a peritonsillar abscess would not cause such widespread swelling and tenderness. Sublingual hematoma is rare and usually a result of trauma."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including dysphagia, swelling in the neck and jaw, and dental pain, suggest a deep neck infection. In this case, the most likely diagnosis is Ludwig angina, which is characterized by bilateral submandibular space infections involving the floor of the mouth. Lymphadenitis and peritonsillar abscess are also possible, but are less likely given the patient\u2019s presentation. Sublingual hematoma is not a common diagnosis in this scenario."
