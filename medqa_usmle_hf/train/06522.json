In a patient over 65 with a smoking history, a DEXA scan to screen for osteoporosis is recommended, as well as routine screening for breast and colorectal cancer. While Pap smears are generally no longer recommended for women over 65 with a history of negative results, it's important to confirm the patient's last date of screening to ensure that they are up to date. Mammograms are recommended every 1-2 years for women over 50, but the patient had one within the past year. No intervention needed is not an appropriate response as routine screening is important for early detection and prevention of various conditions."
