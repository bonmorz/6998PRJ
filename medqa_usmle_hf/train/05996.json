HDL levels are often referred to as \u201cgood cholesterol\u201d and it is desirable to have higher levels of HDL in the blood. Niacin is a lipid level modifying drug that most effectively increases serum HDL levels but can cause flushing as a side effect. Gallstones and hepatotoxicity are potential side effects of statins, which primarily work to lower LDL levels. Myalgia can also be a side effect of statins."
