The description of the discharge, including its color, consistency, and lack of inflammation, suggests bacterial vaginosis. Epithelial cells coated with bacteria are visible on wet mount microscopy. Gram-positive diplococci and numerous gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria are not typically associated with bacterial vaginosis. A negative whiff test would be unexpected in bacterial vaginosis, as the test is positive due to the presence of amines produced by the bacteria associated with the condition."
