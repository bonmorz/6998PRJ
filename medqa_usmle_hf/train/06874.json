Eukaryotic DNA replication involves multiple origins of replication, which allows for simultaneous replication at several sites, unlike prokaryotes that have a single origin of replication. This multiple-origin feature enables eukaryotic DNA replication to complete the replication of a much larger genome than E. coli within a relatively short period. Therefore, simultaneous replication at multiple origins is the most accurate explanation for the finding."

The key difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA replication is the number of origins of replication. Prokaryotes have one origin while eukaryotes have multiple origins. This allows eukaryotic replication to occur simultaneously at multiple origins, making the overall replication process longer. Inhibition at checkpoint and DNA compaction in chromatin play a role in regulating replication but do not explain the difference in replication time. More efficient DNA polymerase activity would actually speed up replication, making it faster in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes."
