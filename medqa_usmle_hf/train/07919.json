Option (B) suggests cholestasis, which is not seen in this patient. Option (D) suggests chronic anemia, which is not supported by the history or physical exam findings."

Additionally, gamma-glutamyl transferase is also increased in alcoholic liver disease, which makes option A the correct choice. Option B is incorrect because ALP is not typically affected in alcoholic liver disease. Option C is incorrect because normal gamma-glutamyl transferase would not be expected in alcoholic liver disease. Option D is incorrect because the MCV is typically increased, not decreased, in alcoholic liver disease."

Therefore, the most likely laboratory findings in this patient will be AST > ALT, and increased gamma-glutamyl transferase.

AST and ALT are liver enzymes that are elevated in cases of liver damage, which is common in alcohol abuse. Gamma-glutamyl transferase is also a liver enzyme that is commonly elevated in cases of alcohol abuse. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Option B (decreased ALP) is not relevant to alcohol abuse, and option C (AST > ALT, normal gamma glutamyl transferase) is not as specific as option A. Option D (decreased MCV) is a common finding in cases of chronic alcohol abuse, but this patient's symptoms suggest acute alcohol intoxication, so it is not the most likely laboratory finding."
