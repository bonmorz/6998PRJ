However, it has a high false-positive rate. As the patient has no subjective complaints and no co-existing diseases, the most appropriate next step would be further testing through ultrasound examination to confirm the findings. Also, invasive testing such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling may carry risks and are generally not recommended in low-risk pregnancies unless indicated by further diagnostic testing. Therefore, options A and D are not appropriate. Option B does not provide any additional information, and it is not standard practice to perform this test."
