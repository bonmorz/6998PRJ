The symptoms, including regression in language and motor skills, hand wringing, and difficulty walking point to Rett syndrome. Phenylketonuria can cause developmental delays, but not the regression observed in this patient. Tourette syndrome is characterized by motor and vocal tics, but not the hand-wringing or regression seen in this patient. Autistic spectrum disorder can have some similar symptoms, but regression is not typical and hand-wringing is not a defining feature."
