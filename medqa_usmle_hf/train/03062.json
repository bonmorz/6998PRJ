The patient\u2019s symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which often requires intravenous or intramuscular antibiotics. Ceftriaxone and doxycycline are common choices for treatment of PID. Metronidazole would be appropriate for treatment of bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis, but not likely for this patient\u2019s presentation. Levofloxacin and azithromycin would be appropriate for treatment of urinary tract infections or sexually transmitted infections, but may not sufficiently cover PID. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be appropriate for uncomplicated urinary tract infections, but may not be sufficient for PID."
