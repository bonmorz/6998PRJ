The displacement and hypoplasia of the left thumb along with the symptoms suggest that the most likely diagnosis is Tetralogy of Fallot. This is supported by the presence of a right ventricular lift, single S2, and harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border on examination. This is confirmed by the chest x-ray which shows a boot-shaped heart. Transposition of great vessels would present with severe cyanosis and no murmur. Ventricular septal defect is unlikely to cause cyanosis unless it is large, and transient tachypnea of the newborn is a respiratory condition that does not involve heart abnormalities."

The displacement and hypoplasia of the left thumb, along with the symptoms, suggest that the baby has Tetralogy of Fallot.

The chest X-ray also shows a boot-shaped heart, which is a hallmark finding in Tetralogy of Fallot. Transposition of great vessels presents with early cyanosis and a normal heart size on chest X-ray.
