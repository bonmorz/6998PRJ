The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest an omphalomesenteric duct remnant, which is the most common cause of umbilical discharge in infants. The green-yellow discharge resembling feces is consistent with meconium, which is the substance found in the intestine of newborns. The urachus is responsible for the excretion of urine in utero, but does not cause symptoms after cord separation. The umbilical arteries usually obliterate after birth and do not cause symptoms."
