The presentation of lower extremity edema, hematuria, proteinuria, and decreased complement levels suggest a renal pathology.

Apple-green birefringence on Congo red stain is a characteristic of amyloidosis, glomerular basement membrane thinning and splitting is seen in membranous nephropathy, and a normal appearing glomerulus would be unusual in this clinical setting."
