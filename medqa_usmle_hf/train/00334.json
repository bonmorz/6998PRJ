This results in difficulty digesting and absorbing nutrients, leading to large, greasy stools, and increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections. The patient's low weight and height percentiles also support this diagnosis. Softening of the occipital and parietal bones, as well as wheezing and rhonchi, suggest lung involvement. Deficient \u03b11 antitrypsin can cause lung disease, but not the digestive symptoms observed in this case. Absent T cells would lead to severe immunodeficiency, and impaired ciliary function would cause respiratory infections, but not the digestive symptoms observed in this case."

The large-volume, loose and greasy stools are due to pancreatic insufficiency, while the recurrent respiratory tract infections and wheezing are due to increased mucus production in the lungs. Softening of the occipital and parietal bones is a sign of rickets, which can be caused by malabsorption of vitamin D due to pancreatic insufficiency. Deficient \u03b11 antitrypsin can lead to pulmonary emphysema, but this is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Absent T cells and impaired ciliary function are associated with other conditions like severe combined immunodeficiency and primary ciliary dyskinesia, respectively, and are not likely causes of the patient's symptoms."
