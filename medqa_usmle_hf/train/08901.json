The patient has atrial fibrillation and is taking several medications, and the symptoms suggest he may have digoxin toxicity. The most likely ECG finding in this case would be an increased PR interval, as digoxin toxicity can cause AV block. Peaked T waves can be seen in hyperkalemia or acute myocardial infarction, which are not likely in this case. Mobitz type 2 AV block is unlikely without any evidence of prior heart disease. Low QRS voltage can be seen in certain conditions, but the symptoms and clinical presentation do not suggest this as the diagnosis."
