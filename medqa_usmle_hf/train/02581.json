This is the most likely cause for the poor treatment response."

Antacids can interfere with the effectiveness of medications used to treat H. pylori infection, and they can also mask symptoms of GERD, which can worsen gastric ulcer. Alcohol use, allopurinol, and ibuprofen can all cause gastric ulcer, but the patient\u2019s biopsy was negative for malignancy, so it is unlikely that these factors are contributing to his poor treatment response."

The patient's frequent use of antacids, up to 10-12 tablets a day, may interfere with the absorption of proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, which is part of the treatment for H. pylori infection. This can lead to poor treatment response. Alcohol use may irritate and exacerbate gastric ulcer, but the patient only drinks twice a week. Allopurinol is used to treat gout and is not known to interfere with H. pylori treatment. Ibuprofen use may cause gastric ulcers, but the patient only uses it during acute gout attacks."
