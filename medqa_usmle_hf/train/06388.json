The patient has several signs of Cushing syndrome, which is caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of glucocorticoids. The pathogenesis of hyperglycemia in Cushing syndrome is due to the activation of intracellular corticosteroid receptors in the hepatocytes, which triggers the transcription of gluconeogenic enzymes. Option B describes this mechanism. Option A is incorrect because glucocorticoids bind to intracellular receptors, not surface receptors. Option C is incorrect because glucocorticoids do not affect glucose filtration in the kidneys. Option D is incorrect because glucocorticoids do not activate gluconeogenic enzymes via the cAMP pathway."

Option A is incorrect because the inositol-3-phosphate pathway is not involved in gluconeogenesis. Option C is incorrect because glucocorticoids do not inhibit glucose filtration. Option D is incorrect because the cAMP pathway is not involved in gluconeogenesis."

The patient has many clinical signs of Cushing's syndrome, such as abdominal obesity, round red face, increased fat deposition, and diminished skin elasticity.

Glucocorticoids can lead to hyperglycemia via the activation of intracellular corticosteroid receptors in hepatocytes, which triggers transcription of gluconeogenic enzymes. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. Options (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect as they do not describe the mechanism by which glucocorticoids cause hyperglycemia."

Glucocorticoids are known to increase blood glucose levels by inducing hepatic gluconeogenesis, which is accomplished by the transcription of gluconeogenic enzymes from DNA-binding to glucocorticoid response elements in hepatocytes. Therefore, answer (B) is the correct option. Option (A) is incorrect because the inositol-3-phosphate pathway is not involved in the pathogenesis of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia.
