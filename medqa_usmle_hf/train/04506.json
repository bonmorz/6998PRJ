Option B, a decreased AFP, increased HCG, and decreased unconjugated estriol, is indicative of an increased risk for Down's syndrome. This is known as the triple screen test, which measures levels of AFP, HCG, and unconjugated estriol to assess the risk of Down's and other chromosomal abnormalities. An increased AFP alone (option A) or abnormal HCG and unconjugated estriol levels alone (options C and D) are not specific to Down's syndrome. Further testing, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, may be recommended to confirm a diagnosis of Down's syndrome."
