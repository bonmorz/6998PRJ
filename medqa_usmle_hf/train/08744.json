Her elevated serum prolactin level is most likely due to hypothyroidism-induced hyperprolactinemia. In addition, the milky discharge from her nipples is also possible due to hyperprolactinemia. Prolactinoma or thyrotropic pituitary adenoma could also cause hyperprolactinemia, but these are less likely given the patient's clinical presentation and history of hypothyroidism. Ectopic prolactin production is rare and unlikely to be the cause of this patient's symptoms."
