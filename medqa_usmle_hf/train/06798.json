Acute glomerulonephritis can also present with hematuria and proteinuria, but usually with red blood cell casts rather than eosinophils. Renal cell carcinoma can also present with hematuria, but not with eosinophils in the urine. Acute tubular necrosis does not present with eosinophils in the urine."

Acute glomerulonephritis usually causes an elevated serum creatinine level, which is not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

The history of arthritis and the use of ibuprofen suggest that the most likely diagnosis is acute tubulointerstitial nephritis caused by NSAIDs. The urinalysis shows eosinophils, which are suggestive of an allergic reaction in the kidney. The presence of blood and protein in the urine suggests kidney damage. Acute glomerulonephritis usually presents with red urine that is tea-colored, as opposed to bright red. Renal cell carcinoma is unlikely to cause sudden onset of symptoms, and acute tubular necrosis usually presents with muddy brown casts in the urine."
