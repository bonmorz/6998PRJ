The patient\u2019s history of irregular menstrual cycles, vaginal atrophy, fatigue, and weight gain suggest hypothyroidism, which is also supported by the high TSH level. The nipple discharge and high prolactin level can be explained by the effect of hypothyroidism on the hypothalamus, leading to increased secretion of prolactin. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the nipple discharge in this patient is hypothyroidism."
