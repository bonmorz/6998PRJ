Given that q = 0.1, we can calculate p as follows:\n\np^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1\np^2 + 2p(0.1) + (0.1)^2 = 1\np^2 + 0.2p + 0.01 = 1\np^2 + 0.2p - 0.99 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\np = (-0.2 \u00b1 sqrt(0.2^2 - 4(1)(-0.99))) / (2(1))\np = (-0.2 \u00b1 sqrt(1.04)) / 2\np = (-0.2 \u00b1 1.02) / 2\n\nThe positive solution is:\n\np = (-0.2 + 1.02) / 2\np = 0.41\n\nTherefore, the proportion of flies with white-eyes is p^2 = 0.41^2 = 0.1681 or 16.81%, which is closest to answer choice (B). However, it should be noted that none of the answer choices are exactly correct."
