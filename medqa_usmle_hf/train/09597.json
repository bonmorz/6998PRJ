The radiograph of the pelvis indicates Paget\u2019s disease, which is characterized by increased bone resorption followed by disorganized new bone formation. The most important initial diagnostic study to confirm Paget\u2019s disease is an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level. Elevated serum osteocalcin can occur in both bone resorption and formation disorders, and an elevated serum parathyroid hormone level is more common in hyperparathyroidism. Serum phosphorus level would be decreased in hypophosphatemic rickets."
