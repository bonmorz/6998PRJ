Decreased reticulocyte count and indirect bilirubin levels are not typically seen in hemolytic anemia. Decreased mean corpuscular volume is seen in microcytic anemia, which is not consistent with the patient\u2019s peripheral blood smear results."

Bite cells and Heinz bodies seen in the peripheral blood smear indicate hemolysis, which may suggest a G6PD deficiency. One of the laboratory findings associated with hemolysis is an increased LDH level. The presence of scleral icterus and jaundice indicates an increased indirect bilirubin level, ruling out option (B). Option (A) is incorrect because hemolysis usually leads to an increased reticulocyte count. Option (D) is incorrect because hemolysis usually leads to an increased mean corpuscular volume."
