The urinalysis shows no leukocytes but 2 RBCs/HPF. The abnormal BUN and creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function, which could be due to the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Option A is the correct choice as the patient\u2019s symptoms have resolved and the elevated BUN and creatinine are likely due to the medication. Stopping the medication and rechecking in 1-2 weeks is a reasonable course of action. Options B and C are not necessary, given the patient\u2019s history and lack of significant findings on physical examination. Option D is not appropriate based on the information given."

The patient's symptoms are consistent with benign prostate hyperplasia and not related to the urinary tract infection or medication. The increase in BUN and creatinine levels suggests acute kidney injury, but this can be caused by the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Therefore, the initial approach should be to stop the medication and monitor the patient's kidney function in 1-2 weeks. Intravenous pyelography and cystoscopy are not indicated at this time, and there is no indication for admission."

Option (A) is the appropriate management, with monitoring of renal function and stopping the medication. Options (B) and (C) are invasive and not necessary at this time. Option (D) is also not the appropriate management for this scenario."

The increase in creatinine suggests that the patient\u2019s renal function has decreased. However, there is no current evidence of an acute issue such as acute interstitial nephritis or obstruction. Therefore, the most appropriate course of action would be to stop the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and repeat the measurement in 1-2 weeks. It is possible that the antibiotic may have caused a mild increase in creatinine, which could resolve once the medication is discontinued. Further testing such as intravenous pyelography or cystoscopy may be considered if the creatinine continues to increase and other potential causes of renal dysfunction are ruled out."

Options B and C involve more invasive testing and should only be considered if other diagnostic criteria are met. Option D is not indicated, as the patient is stable and does not have any signs of acute interstitial nephritis."
