The symptoms described by the patient suggest ADHD, which is typically treated with stimulant medications such as methylphenidate or amphetamines. Among the options, only Guanfacine is an FDA approved non-stimulant medication for ADHD. However, the answer options provided do not include Guanfacine, and instead includes Haloperidol, which is an antipsychotic medication used for conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It is not approved for ADHD treatment and its use in this case would not be appropriate. Therefore, this question is flawed and requires revision."
