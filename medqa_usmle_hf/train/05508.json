Plasmapheresis may be indicated as a second-line therapy in severe, refractory cases of acute relapses. Riluzole is used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, not multiple sclerosis."

The patient\u2019s muscle weakness, increased tone, and exaggerated reflexes are signs of upper motor neuron involvement. The decreased sensation up to the level of the umbilicus is consistent with a lesion affecting the thoracic spinal cord. The electric shock-like sensation upon neck flexion is known as Lhermitte\u2019s sign and suggests involvement of the cervical spinal cord. The swollen optic discs suggest papilledema, which can be a sign of increased intracranial pressure. Intravenous methylprednisolone is the treatment of choice for acute myelitis."
