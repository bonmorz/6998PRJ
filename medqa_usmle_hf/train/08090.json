Bosentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist, which means it blocks the effects of the endothelin hormone, ultimately leading to vasodilation and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with pulmonary artery hypertension. Option B is incorrect because agonists would activate the receptor, not block it. Option C is incorrect because phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are used to treat erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension, but they work by a different mechanism of action. Option D is incorrect because calcium channel blockers have a similar effect of vasodilation, but they are not typically used as first-line treatment for pulmonary artery hypertension."
