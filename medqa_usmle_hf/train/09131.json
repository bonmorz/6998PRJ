The coin-shaped lesion in the periphery of the middle lobe of the right lung suggests adenocarcinoma, which is the most common type of lung cancer in non-smokers and women.

Large cell carcinoma does not usually present with a coin-shaped lesion, and squamous cell carcinoma is often associated with a central lesion in the lung."
