The patient's symptoms suggest alcohol-induced vertigo and the fact that she was warned about side effects indicates that she is taking a medication that can cause these symptoms. Among the options, only closing potassium channels is a mechanism of action for diabetes drugs that can cause these symptoms. This mechanism of action is seen in sulfonylureas, which increase insulin release by closing ATP-sensitive potassium channels in pancreatic beta cells."
