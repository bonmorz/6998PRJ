CD8+ lymphocytic infiltration is seen in autoimmune myositis, endomysial fibrosis with absent dystrophin is seen in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and intermyofibrillar proliferation of mitochondria is seen in mitochondrial myopathies."

The symptoms of fatigue and weakness after exertion, along with leg cramps and relief with rest, suggest a muscular disorder.

Option D is the most likely as it suggests a glycogen storage disease like McArdle's disease, which would lead to exercise intolerance and an increase in serum ammonia levels during exercise. Intrafascicular CD8+ lymphocytic infiltration suggests an autoimmune myositis, endomysial fibrosis with absent dystrophin suggests Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and intermyofibrillar proliferation of mitochondria suggests mitochondrial myopathy."

The symptoms of chronic fatigue and muscle weakness after exertion, along with the presence of blood in urine suggests exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis. The fact that ammonia levels increase over time and lactate levels remain stable suggests the muscle is unable to properly utilize oxygen during exercise, leading to anaerobic metabolism and the accumulation of byproducts such as ammonia. This suggests that the biopsy would most likely show subsarcolemmal acid-Schiff-positive deposits, which are indicative of mitochondrial myopathies."
