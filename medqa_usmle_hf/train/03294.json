Polyarteritis nodosa can cause joint pain and nodules, but is less likely to cause weak pulses. Thromboangiitis obliterans typically presents with symptoms in the legs and feet, not diffuse joint pain. Temporal arteritis is unlikely given the absence of temple pain or headaches. The elevated sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein support the diagnosis of an inflammatory condition."

The symptoms, presence of erythematous nodules, and weak pulses suggest Takayasu arteritis, which is an inflammatory disease of large arteries.

Thromboangiitis obliterans primarily affects small and medium-sized arteries of the extremities. Temporal arteritis typically presents with headache, jaw claudication, and visual disturbances, which are not present in this patient."

This condition is a type of vasculitis that involves inflammation of the large vessels, such as the aorta and its branches. The weak pulses and laboratory findings (elevated ESR and CRP, low hemoglobin and hematocrit, and elevated platelet count) are also consistent with this diagnosis. Other options, such as polyarteritis nodosa and thromboangiitis obliterans, typically do not involve the large vessels seen in Takayasu arteritis. Temporal arteritis, which is also known as giant cell arteritis, may involve the aorta and its branches but typically affects older individuals and presents with headache, scalp tenderness, and jaw claudication."

The patient's symptoms, including joint pain, night sweats, and malaise, suggest the most likely diagnosis is Takayasu arteritis, a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the large elastic arteries.

Polyarteritis nodosa is another systemic vasculitis that affects medium-sized arteries, but it does not typically present with erythematous nodules or affect the large elastic arteries like Takayasu arteritis. Thromboangiitis obliterans primarily affects the smaller arteries and veins of the extremities, and temporal arteritis affects the temporal artery and can cause headache and vision changes."
