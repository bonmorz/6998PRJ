These symptoms are consistent with gallstone pancreatitis, which is confirmed by the elevated amylase and WBC count, as well as the elevated bilirubin indicating obstructive jaundice. Cholelithiasis typically does not present with elevated amylase or WBC count. Choledocholithiasis and ascending cholangitis may present similarly but are less likely given the absence of jaundice and other specific findings on physical exam."

The symptoms suggest acute pancreatitis, and the high amylase levels and diffuse abdominal tenderness are in line with that diagnosis. The elevated bilirubin levels suggest that obstruction caused by a gallstone is the cause, making option B (gallstone pancreatitis) the most likely diagnosis. The other options involve obstructions in the bile duct, not the pancreatic duct, and would not typically present with such high amylase levels."

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest gallstone pancreatitis, which can cause abdominal pain that radiates to the back, malaise, chills, nausea, and vomiting. Elevated amylase and WBCs are also common in pancreatitis. Cholelithiasis refers to the presence of gallstones in the gallbladder but does not necessarily cause symptoms. Choledocholithiasis is when the stones get stuck in the bile duct, causing jaundice and gallstone pancreatitis. Ascending cholangitis is an infection of the biliary tract, causing fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain, but usually occurs in the setting of a bile duct obstruction."
