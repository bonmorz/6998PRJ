It can be combined with metformin, and there is no high risk of hypoglycemia associated with its use. However, studies have shown that it does not lead to a significant decrease in cardiovascular outcomes. It can be combined with insulin, but dosages may need to be adjusted. Therefore, the most correct statement is that it does not decrease cardiovascular outcomes."

While hypoglycemia is a risk with all medications used to treat diabetes, the risk is not considered high with exenatide. It can also be used in combination with insulin in certain patients. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."
