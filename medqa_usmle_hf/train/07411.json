During exercise, the body works harder and requires more blood flow, so systemic vascular resistance decreases in order to increase blood flow to the muscles. The heart pumps more blood with each beat, so stroke volume actually increases during exercise. Blood pressure may increase temporarily during exercise, but it should not decrease. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Decreased systemic vascular resistance."

During exercise, the body increases cardiac output by increasing heart rate and stroke volume, which leads to decreased systemic vascular resistance as blood vessels in the muscles dilate to increase blood flow to the working muscles. This could result in a temporary increase in blood pressure during exercise, but overall, systemic vascular resistance is decreased. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. Option (A), increased systemic vascular resistance, is not a typical response to exercise. Option (B), decreased stroke volume, would result in a decrease in cardiac output and could be a sign of cardiovascular dysfunction during exercise. Option (D), decreased blood pressure, is not a typical response to exercise and could be a sign of a medical emergency."
