The patient\u2019s symptoms of medial joint tenderness, erythema, and clicking sensation along with the absence of anterior displacement in the anterior drawer test suggests damage to the medial meniscus. The anterior drawer test is used to assess for damage to the anterior cruciate ligament, which is not found to be damaged in this patient. The medial collateral ligament and lateral meniscus may also be injured in cases of knee trauma, but in this patient, the clinical presentation and exam findings suggest damage to the medial meniscus."

Medial joint tenderness, subtle clicking, and locking are all signs of meniscal injury. The absent anterior displacement of the tibia on the anterior drawer test rules out an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury. The lateral meniscus and medial collateral ligament (MCL) are less likely to be injured based on the patient\u2019s symptoms and physical examination."

Medial joint tenderness, erythema and bruising, clicking of the joint, and an antalgic gait are all indicative of a meniscal injury. Absent anterior displacement of the tibia on an anterior drawer test rules out an anterior cruciate ligament injury. A medial collateral ligament injury would cause tenderness along the medial aspect of the knee, but would not cause joint clicking or locking. The lateral meniscus is less commonly injured than the medial meniscus."
