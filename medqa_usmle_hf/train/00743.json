The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest acute cholangitis, likely caused by a stone obstructing the common bile duct. The ultrasound showing dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder further supports this diagnosis. The patient's worsening condition, including altered mental status and fever, raises concern for sepsis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the most appropriate next step in management to both diagnose and treat the underlying obstruction. ERCP can be used to remove the stone and relieve biliary obstruction, as well as obtain cultures to guide antibiotic therapy. Abdominal CT or laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be considered, but ERCP is the most urgent and definitive intervention in this scenario. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is used for the treatment of gallstones, but this patient has evidence of biliary obstruction beyond the gallbladder."
