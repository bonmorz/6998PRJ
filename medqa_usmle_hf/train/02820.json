Nystatin is an antifungal drug that works by binding to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, leading to membrane disruption and fungal death.

Mutations of the \u03b2-glucan gene and altered binding sites of squalene epoxidase would affect the synthesis of cell wall and membrane, respectively, but not directly affect the target of nystatin.

Squalene epoxidase is a target of terbinafine, not nystatin. Dysfunctional cytochrome P-450 enzymes can lead to resistance to azoles, not nystatin."
