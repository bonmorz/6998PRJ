While aspergilloma and mycobacterial infection may occur in patients with underlying lung disease, they are not typically associated with pleural plaques and subpleural linear opacities. Malignant mesothelioma is also associated with asbestos exposure but typically presents with pleural effusions and focal pleural thickening rather than diffuse infiltrates."
