The patient has diabetes mellitus, severe gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a BMI of 36.5 kg/m2, making him a good candidate for surgical intervention. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a commonly used surgical procedure for obese patients with these comorbidities. BPD-DS is a more complex and high-risk surgery, while laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding is less effective in treating comorbidities such as diabetes and reflux disease. No surgical management is not recommended given the patient's medical history and lack of success with non-surgical weight loss attempts."

Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the most appropriate surgical management for this patient because it is effective for weight loss and can improve or resolve both GERD and diabetes.

Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding is less effective at weight loss and does not address the patient's GERD and diabetes.
