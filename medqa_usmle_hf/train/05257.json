Trinucleotide repeat expansions are associated with certain types of genetic disorders, but not muscular dystrophy. Splice site mutations result in abnormal RNA splicing, which may lead to genetic disorders but is not a typical cause of muscular dystrophy. Frameshift mutations result from the insertion or deletion of nucleotides in the DNA sequence, which can cause genetic disorders, but again, are not a common cause of muscular dystrophy."
