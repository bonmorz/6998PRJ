The patient presents with weakness in abduction, lateral rotation, flexion, and supination of the left arm, which suggests damage to the C5-C6 nerve roots, as these roots innervate the muscles responsible for these movements. The radial nerve innervates the triceps brachii, forearm extensors, and wrist extensors, which are not affected in this patient. The C8-T1 nerve roots innervate the hand and fingers, which the patient denies having any sensory changes in, and the long thoracic nerve innervates the serratus anterior muscle, which is not implicated in the patient's symptoms."
