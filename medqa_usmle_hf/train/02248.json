The patient\u2019s recent history of femur and pelvic fractures suggests that he may have sustained neurologic damage, particularly to the nerves that control sexual function. Additionally, his smoking, excessive alcohol intake, and medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia may increase his risk of atherosclerosis, but the sudden onset of erectile dysfunction suggests neurologic rather than vascular damage. Increased prolactin levels may cause sexual dysfunction, but this is unlikely based on the patient\u2019s history. Medication changes may contribute, but trazodone is not commonly associated with sexual dysfunction."
