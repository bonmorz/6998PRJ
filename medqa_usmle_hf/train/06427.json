The shortened QT interval on ECG can also be indicative of hypercalcemia. In hypercalcemia, the serum calcium level increases, while the serum phosphorus level decreases due to increased renal excretion. Parathyroid hormone levels may vary depending on the cause of hypercalcemia, but in this case, it is likely that parathyroid hormone is decreased due to the effect of negative feedback. The level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D may also be decreased due to decreased parathyroid hormone levels. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) \u2191 \u2193 \u2193 \u2193."
