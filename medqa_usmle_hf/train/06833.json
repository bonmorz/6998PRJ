The ophthalmoscopy reveals arteriolar nicking and papilledema, which are evidence of long-standing and severe hypertension. The presence of proteinuria indicates that the hypertension is causing damage to the kidneys. The best explanation for the pathophysiology responsible for the neovascular changes present in this patient is smooth muscle hyperplasia and duplication of the basement membrane. This is a typical adaptation to chronic hypertension, where the vessel walls thicken and narrow due to the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix deposition. Cholesterol deposition in the vascular lumen is typical of atherosclerosis, which is not present in this case. Weakening of vessel wall following endothelial injury and protein deposition in the vascular lumen are not prominent features of hypertension-related vascular changes."

The patient\u2019s symptoms and ophthalmic findings suggest hypertensive emergency, which is often caused by systemic hypertension leading to smooth muscle hyperplasia and duplication of the basement membrane in arterioles. This results in narrowing of the lumen and reduced blood flow to organs, including the eyes. Cholesterol deposition may cause atherosclerosis but is not the main cause of hypertensive emergency. Weakening of vessel walls following endothelial injury can lead to aneurysms, but this is not the case here. Protein deposition in the vascular lumen is not a common finding in hypertensive emergency."

This occurs due to chronic elevated blood pressure leading to thickening of the walls of arterioles, narrowing of their lumen, and decreased blood flow. This, in turn, causes ischemia and damage to the surrounding tissues, including the retina."
