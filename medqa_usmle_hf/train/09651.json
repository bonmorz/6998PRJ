In HIV-infected patients with low CD4+ counts, cerebral toxoplasmosis is a common opportunistic infection that can cause multiple ring-enhancing lesions in the brain. The negative India ink preparation rules out cryptococcal meningitis, which is another common neurologic manifestation in HIV-infected patients. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy can present with similar imaging findings, but it usually occurs at a later stage of HIV infection with even lower CD4+ counts. Primary CNS lymphoma may also present with focal lesions in HIV-infected patients, but ring-enhancement is less common. HIV encephalopathy may present with diffuse brain atrophy and white matter signal abnormalities, but not with ring-enhancing lesions."

The negative India ink preparation of cerebrospinal fluid rules out meningitis, and the CD4+ count suggests immunosuppression. HIV encephalopathy is a possibility, but the presence of ring-enhancing lesions is more specific for cerebral toxoplasmosis. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and primary CNS lymphoma also present with neurological symptoms, but their imaging findings differ from those seen with cerebral toxoplasmosis."
