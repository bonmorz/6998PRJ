The absence of cervical motion tenderness and adnexal tenderness makes inflammatory bacterial infection less likely. The patient's IUD use and recent course of antibiotics increase the likelihood of anaerobic bacteria overgrowth. Physiologic discharge is not associated with strong odor. There is no indication of pregnancy within the uterine tubes. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is anaerobic bacteria overgrowth within the vagina."
