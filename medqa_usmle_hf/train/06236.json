The presentation is consistent with meningococcal meningitis, which requires droplet precautions and prophylaxis for close contacts. Rifampin would be the correct choice for prophylaxis in this case as it covers Neisseria meningitidis. Adding ampicillin, dexamethasone, and rifampin or ampicillin alone would not be necessary. Treating the boyfriend with ceftriaxone and vancomycin would not be necessary as he is not showing symptoms and is not a confirmed carrier of Neisseria meningitidis."

Rifampin is the drug of choice for prophylaxis in this case. Adding ampicillin or dexamethasone to the treatment regimen is not necessary. Treating the boyfriend with ceftriaxone and vancomycin is not necessary as he is not demonstrating symptoms of meningitis, but he should still receive prophylactic treatment with rifampin due to close contact with the patient."

The symptoms suggest meningitis, and the increased cell count with a neutrophil predominance and gram-negative diplococci on Gram stain suggest Neisseria meningitidis. The best next step in management would be to treat the boyfriend with rifampin as prophylaxis to prevent further spread of the infection. Ampicillin is not effective against Neisseria meningitidis, and dexamethasone is reserved for certain types of meningitis. Treating the boyfriend with ceftriaxone and vancomycin may not be necessary since he may not have an active infection, and without testing, it is not clear if he is a carrier or not. Nonetheless, prophylaxis with rifampin is still necessary to prevent further spread of the infection."
