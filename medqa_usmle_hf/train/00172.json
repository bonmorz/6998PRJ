Insulin is known to stimulate the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters from internal cell compartments to the plasma membrane of muscle and adipose cells, resulting in glucose uptake. This process is not observed in other cell types. Increased levels of circulating insulin, therefore, selectively increase glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes. Increased plasma glucose concentration may increase glucose uptake in other cell types, such as liver cells. Decreased plasma glucose concentration may lead to hypoglycemia and is not a viable option for selectively increasing glucose uptake. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer."

Insulin is a hormone that stimulates glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes by promoting the translocation of glucose transporters to the cell membrane. This process is mediated by the insulin receptor, which is expressed on these cells but not on other cell types. Therefore, increased levels of circulating insulin would selectively increase glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes without directly affecting glucose transport in other cell types. Increased plasma glucose concentration would affect glucose transport in all cell types, not just skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes. Decreased plasma glucose concentration would lead to decreased glucose uptake in all cells."

Insulin is known to selectively increase glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes by binding to insulin receptors on these cells, leading to translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. This process is unique to these cell types and not seen in other cell types, thus making option (A) the correct answer. Increased plasma glucose concentration (option B) may increase glucose uptake in other cell types as well, and decreased plasma glucose concentration (option C) may cause hypoglycemia and trigger a stress response that leads to glucose release from other cells. Option (D) is not accurate as insulin signaling is a well-known physiological mechanism for selective glucose uptake in these cells."

Insulin specifically binds to and activates the insulin receptor on skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes, leading to the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the cell surface and increasing glucose uptake. This process is not observed in other cell types, allowing for selective glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipocytes. Increased plasma glucose concentration alone would not selectively increase glucose uptake in these cells, and decreased plasma glucose concentration would have the opposite effect. It is physiologically possible to selectively increase glucose uptake in specific cells, as demonstrated by the insulin-mediated pathway in skeletal muscle and adipocytes."
