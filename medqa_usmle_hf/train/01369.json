The other options describe different causes of urinary incontinence, such as neurogenic bladder from spinal cord injury (detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia), aging or spinal cord injury (impaired detrusor contractility), or neurological disorders (loss of sphincter control). However, none of these seem to fit the patient's symptoms as described."

The patient's symptoms of leakage with laughing or sneezing suggest that the primary underlying etiology is urethral hypermobility.

Impaired detrusor contractility would cause difficulty in initiating micturition and incomplete emptying.
