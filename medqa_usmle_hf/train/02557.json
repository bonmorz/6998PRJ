The arrow in the photomicrograph points to a granuloma, which is characteristic of tuberculosis. Interferon gamma and interleukin-2 are key cytokines involved in the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and are therefore the most likely answer choice. Tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-4 play a role in the immune response to tuberculosis but are not as central as interferon gamma and interleukin-2. Interferon alpha and interleukin-1 are not typically involved in the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Transforming growth factor beta and interleukin-12 may be involved in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis but are not the primary cytokines involved in granuloma formation."
