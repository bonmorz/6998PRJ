The patient\u2019s echocardiogram reveals a dilated right ventricle with systolic pressure and both tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation. These findings suggest that the disease process is most analogous to carcinoid syndrome, which can cause right-sided heart failure due to the release of vasoactive substances that affect the pulmonary vasculature. The patient\u2019s use of weight loss medications that may contain serotonergic agents also increases suspicion for carcinoid syndrome. Subacute endocarditis and left heart failure typically present with different symptoms and findings. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can cause pulmonary hypertension, but it typically presents with respiratory symptoms, which this patient does not have."
