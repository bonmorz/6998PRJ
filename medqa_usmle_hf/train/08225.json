Based on the presentation and history, the most likely cause of the infant's condition is respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which is common in premature infants born before 36 weeks. The presence of central cyanosis, nasal flaring, subcostal retractions, and diffuse ground-glass opacifications on chest X-ray are all consistent with RDS. Gestational diabetes can contribute to the development of RDS in premature infants due to altered glucose metabolism, which can interfere with the production and secretion of surfactant in the lungs. Alcohol abuse, Down syndrome, and lithium are not known to be risk factors for RDS."
