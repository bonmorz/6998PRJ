A straight leg raise test is positive, which further supports the diagnosis of a herniated disc or disc bulge at the L5-S1 level. Patellar reflexes are normal, indicating that the L4 nerve root is not affected. The Achilles reflex is decreased on the left, which may be due to S1 nerve root involvement.

The pain radiating down the left leg into the left foot, especially along the posterior thigh and posterolateral leg into the fourth and fifth toes, suggests that the S1 nerve root is most likely affected. A straight leg raise test that elicits radiating pain into the leg is indicative of a herniated disc, which could be pressing on the S1 nerve root. The lack of bowel or bladder dysfunction rules out cauda equina syndrome, which would affect multiple nerve roots, including S2-S4. The normal patellar reflexes and decreased Achilles reflex on the left are not particularly useful in localizing the affected nerve root, but they do suggest that the lower lumbar region is involved."
