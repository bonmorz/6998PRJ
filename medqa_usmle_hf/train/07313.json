The patient presents with acute onset severe abdominal pain and vomiting, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, and a history of hypertension and recent cessation of hydrochlorothiazide. Laboratory studies show elevated lactate, leukocytosis, and normal procoagulant profile. CT angiography confirms the diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia, likely caused by embolus from cardiac arrhythmia. The most appropriate definitive management is balloon angioplasty and stenting to restore blood flow to the affected areas of the intestine. Anticoagulation with heparin may be considered as part of adjunctive treatment, but it alone does not address the underlying vascular obstruction. Colonoscopy and MR angiography are not indicated for the acute management of mesenteric ischemia."
