This suggests that drug B is a competitive antagonist, meaning it competes with drug A for binding sites but does not activate the receptor. Non-competitive antagonists bind to a different site on the receptor and reduce its activity, while inverse agonists decrease the basal activity of the receptor. A functional antagonist produces the opposite effect of an agonist but does not necessarily compete for the same binding site."
