Options B, C, and D are associated with other medical conditions - decreased ADAMTS13 activity is associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, increased p-ANCA titers are associated with microscopic polyangiitis or Churg-Strauss syndrome, and increased anti-GBM titers are associated with Goodpasture syndrome."

The patient\u2019s presentation suggests granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis. The cavitating nodules on chest x-ray, palpable skin lesions, and nasal ulcerations are classic for GPA. GPA is associated with increased c-ANCA titers. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. Option (B) is associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Option (C) is associated with microscopic polyangiitis. Option (D) is associated with Goodpasture syndrome."
