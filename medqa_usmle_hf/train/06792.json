In this case, the RR is 3.0, P(Exposure) is the proportion of patients with elevated LDL levels, which is not given in the question. We can calculate the PAR if we assume that the proportion of patients with elevated LDL levels is equal to the proportion in the study sample. Using the formula with a proportion of 50% (assuming equal distribution), we get PAR = (3.0-1)/3.0 x 0.5 = 0.33 or 33%. This means that 33% of the heart disease in these patients can be attributed to elevated LDL levels. Therefore, the answer is (C)."

PAR = (RR-1)/RR x proportion of exposed. In this case, RR=3.0, so PAR = (3.0-1)/3.0 x proportion of exposed. We are not given the proportion of exposed in the question stem, so we cannot calculate the exact PAR. However, we can use the lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval provided to calculate a range of possible PAR values. When RR=2.0, PAR=(2.0-1)/2.0=0.5. When RR=4.0, PAR=(4.0-1)/4.0=0.75. Therefore, the PAR could range from 0.5 to 0.75, or from 50% to 75%. The closest answer choice is (C) 67%."
