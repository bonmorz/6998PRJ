Sumatriptan is a medication used to treat migraines and is not appropriate for this clinical presentation. Lumbar puncture can be performed to help diagnose a subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis, but should be considered after a CT head to exclude raised intracranial pressure."

Antibiotics are not indicated unless the patient has signs of meningitis. Sumatriptan is used to treat migraines, but this headache is different from the patient's usual migraines.
