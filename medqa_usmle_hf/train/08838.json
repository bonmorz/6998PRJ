The patient is most likely suffering from benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is characterized by sudden dizziness triggered by changes in head position. Canalith repositioning is the most effective treatment, which involves maneuvers to move the displaced otoliths to their correct position in the vestibular system. Oral prednisolone is not indicated for BPPV, and posterior canal occlusion and singular neurectomy are not standard treatments for BPPV."
