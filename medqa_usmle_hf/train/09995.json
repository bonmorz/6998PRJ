Preformed antibodies against class I HLA molecules is the most likely cause of this, as it indicates that the recipient\u2019s immune system recognizes the new kidney as a foreign object and is attacking it. This leads to tissue damage and can cause an increase in serum creatinine levels. Dialysis may be necessary to help support the patient\u2019s kidney function while the rejection is treated."
