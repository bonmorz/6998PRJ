The hazard ratio is a measure of the association between an exposure and an outcome, and a hazard ratio of 1 signifies no association. The confidence interval (CI) represents a range of values within which true population parameter is likely to lie. A wider CI suggests less certainty around the estimated effects. Option A is incorrect because study B has a narrower CI that does not include 1, indicating that the association is statistically significant. Option B is not necessarily correct because sample sizes are not provided in the question stem. Option D is not necessarily correct because power is not mentioned in the question stem. The correct answer is option C because a wider 95% CI (0.89\u20132.9) suggests that study A has a higher p-value than study B, which has a narrower 95% CI (1.1\u20132.5). In other words, the effect size in study A is less precise and less statistically significant than the effect size in study B."

The confidence intervals of both studies overlap, indicating that the association between rheumatoid arthritis and venous thromboembolism may not be statistically significant. Study B has a narrower confidence interval, suggesting a more precise estimate of the hazard ratio. However, we cannot determine which study had a larger sample size or greater power based on the given information. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that the p-value of study A is likely larger than the p-value of study B, as a narrower confidence interval suggests greater precision and stronger evidence against the null hypothesis."

A hazard ratio of 1 indicates that there is no difference in incidence between the two groups. A hazard ratio greater than 1 indicates a higher incidence in one group compared to the other. The confidence interval indicates the range of values within which the true hazard ratio lies with a certain degree of confidence. A 95% confidence interval that does not include 1 is considered statistically significant. Based on the information given, study A has a wider confidence interval that includes 1, so the hazard ratio is not statistically significant. Study B has a narrower confidence interval that excludes 1, so the hazard ratio is statistically significant. Therefore, statement (C) is most accurate.
