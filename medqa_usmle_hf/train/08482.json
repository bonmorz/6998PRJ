The presentation of petechiae, subcutaneous bruising, and pulmonary hemorrhage is consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The low platelet count and abnormal coagulation tests support this diagnosis. Alloimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia would present with a lower platelet count and evidence of maternal antibodies attacking fetal platelets, but there is no indication of maternal or fetal blood group incompatibility in this case. Vitamin K deficiency would result in bleeding, but it would not explain the pulmonary hemorrhage, and the baby's coagulation tests are only slightly abnormal. Platelet dysfunction is a possible cause of bleeding, but it is less likely to explain the combination of petechiae, bruising, and pulmonary hemorrhage seen in this patient."

The abnormal coagulation tests, specifically the prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a condition where the body's clotting function is overactivated, leading to widespread clotting followed by bleeding. Alloimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia may cause low platelet count, but it is less likely to cause the other symptoms presented here. Vitamin K deficiency usually presents with bleeding disorders in the first few days of life, but not to the extent seen in this patient. Platelet dysfunction may cause bleeding disorders, but does not sufficiently explain the other symptoms and laboratory findings seen in this patient."
