The patient has signs and symptoms of surgical site infection, including fever, abdominal pain, new erythema and discharge around the wound, and decreased sensation. In addition, the urine culture grew E. coli, which suggests a possible urinary tract infection. The best next step in management is Vancomycin/piperacillin-tazobactam/clindamycin antibiotics to treat the infection and debridement of the surgical wound to remove any infected tissue. Discontinuing the low-molecular-weight heparin alone is not enough to treat the infection. Oral levofloxacin for 3 days would not be sufficient to treat a surgical site infection."

Discontinuing low-molecular-weight heparin is not necessary in this case. Oral levofloxacin is not recommended as the patient is febrile and the infection has already spread to the surgical wound. Observation alone may not be sufficient as the patient has signs of infection and could have a more severe infection if not treated promptly."

The positive urine culture suggests possible urinary tract infection as the source of infection, but surgery-related infection cannot be ruled out.

Discontinuing low-molecular-weight heparin may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis, so it should be continued along with appropriate monitoring.
