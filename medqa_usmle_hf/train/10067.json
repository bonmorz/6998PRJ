The drugs used to manage bipolar disorder target neurotransmitter systems. Option A (inhibiting reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin) is used in treating depression but is not effective in the manic phase. Option C (increasing concentration of dopamine and norepinephrine) is also used in treating depression but may worsen manic symptoms. Option D targets the inhibitory neurotransmitter, which is not the main problem in a manic phase. The correct option is B, inhibiting inositol monophosphatase and inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase, which decreases the level of inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol, leading to a decrease in the hyperactive intracellular signaling pathway, which is part of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder."
