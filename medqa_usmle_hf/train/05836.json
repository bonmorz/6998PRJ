The patient\u2019s history and laboratory findings suggest amebiasis, which can lead to the formation of liver abscesses. The hypoechoic lesion in the right lobe of the liver seen on ultrasonography further supports this diagnosis. Hepatic hydatid cysts can also cause similar symptoms and imaging findings, but the patient's history does not suggest exposure to the parasite, Echinococcus granulosus. Pyogenic liver abscesses usually occur with multiple lesions, and hepatocellular carcinoma typically presents with elevated liver function tests and imaging findings of a hypervascular mass, not a hypoechoic lesion."

Hepatic hydatid cysts usually appear as a cyst with daughter cysts, while Pyogenic liver abscess will present with fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma may present with liver function test abnormalities, but it is not consistent with the ultrasound image described."
