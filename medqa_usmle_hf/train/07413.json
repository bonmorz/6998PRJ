The descriptions of the patient's hearing loss suggest damage to the inner ear or specifically the organ of Corti, which is responsible for detection of sound. The Rinne test results indicate that sound is being transmitted through the air normally, ruling out perforation of the tympanic membrane or immobility of the stapes as a cause. A normal Weber test rules out unilateral hearing loss or differences in pressure, making excess endolymphatic fluid pressure less likely as a cause."

Immobility of the stapes would result in conductive hearing loss instead. Perforation of the tympanic membrane and excess endolymphatic fluid pressure can also cause hearing loss but would not present with the specific pattern of difficulty hearing certain sounds while being able to hear others."
