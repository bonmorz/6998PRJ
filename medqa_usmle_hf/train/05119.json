Unstable angina pectoris and stress cardiomyopathy would not explain the improvement in contractile function seen on follow-up echocardiography.

The hypokinesis on echocardiography suggests reduced contractility, but the resolution of shortness of breath after angioplasty and stent placement suggests improvement in blood flow to the hypokinetic region. This is consistent with hibernating myocardium, where a myocardial region is viable but reduced in function due to reduced blood flow, and can improve with revascularization. Unstable angina pectoris is a possible cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms but is not the most accurate explanation for the changes in echocardiography. Stress cardiomyopathy is not supported by the patient\u2019s presentation. Cardiac remodeling does not explain the improvement in regional contractile function."
