While viral hepatitis may cause elevated liver function tests, the positive anti-HBs suggests the patient has recovered from a previous infection. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is more commonly associated with elevated serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels, but typically has a negative AMA. Cardiac cirrhosis is associated with chronic right heart failure and typically presents with ascites and edema, which are not seen in this patient's presentation."
