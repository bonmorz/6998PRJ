The painful ulcers in the mouth, abdominal pain, and diarrhea are common symptoms, and the cobblestone mucosa seen on colonoscopy is a hallmark finding. The photomicrograph also shows the classic granulomas seen in Crohn's disease. Behcet disease may present with oral ulcers but is less likely to present with abdominal symptoms. Whipple disease is rare and typically presents with weight loss and malabsorption, while ulcerative colitis typically presents with bloody diarrhea and rectal urgency."
