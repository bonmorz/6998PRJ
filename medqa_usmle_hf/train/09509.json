The symptoms and findings suggest paralytic ileus or postoperative ileus, likely secondary to surgical manipulation during the cesarean section. The initial management should focus on supportive care, including intravenous fluids and electrolytes, to address dehydration and potential electrolyte imbalances. Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be indicated if there are signs of infection or peritonitis. Laparoscopic exploration or laparotomy may be necessary if there are signs of bowel ischemia or perforation, but they are not indicated as initial management for uncomplicated postoperative ileus."
