Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of septic arthritis in children, followed by Streptococcus species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is more commonly seen in adults, and Salmonella species is usually associated with sickle cell anemia. Staphylococcus epidermidis may be seen in patients with prosthetic joints, but is not a likely cause in this case. The MRI findings are consistent with osteomyelitis, which can be caused by the spread of infection from a nearby joint."
