The patient has a history of long-term hemodialysis and active tuberculosis, which places her at risk for constrictive pericarditis. The presence of pericardial calcifications and small tubular-shaped ventricles on the cardiac ultrasound support this diagnosis. The prominent y descent in the jugular venous pulse is a classic sign of constrictive pericarditis. Dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are less likely given the clinical presentation and history. Atrial fibrillation may be a complication of constrictive pericarditis, but it is not the underlying cause."
