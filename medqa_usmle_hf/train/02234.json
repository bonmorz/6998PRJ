The patient has a history of cough with expectoration, breathing difficulty on exertion, and coarse rhonchi and wheezing on examination, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or bronchitis. The presence of mucoid sputum with predominant macrophages and the chest radiograph findings support this diagnosis. Hyperplasia of the mucus glands in the airways is a characteristic finding in patients with COPD or chronic bronchitis. Destruction of the pulmonary capillary bed and variable-sized cysts against a background of densely scarred lung tissue are associated with emphysema, another form of COPD. Eosinophilic infiltration of the airways is seen in asthma, which can have similar symptoms but a different histological pattern."
