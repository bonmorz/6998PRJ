The lack of response to an oral dose of radiolabeled vitamin B12 but an increase in response to the addition of oral intrinsic factor suggests that the problem is a deficiency in intrinsic factor, which is important for B12 absorption. This deficiency can be caused by gastric carcinoma."

The combination of pallor, reduced sensation in the toes, and laboratory results suggest Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. The positive response to oral intrinsic factor indicates a problem with absorption of Vitamin B12 in the small intestine, which is commonly caused by gastric carcinoma. Colorectal carcinoma and De Quervain thyroiditis do not affect Vitamin B12 absorption. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is also not associated with Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia."

This points to gastric carcinoma as a possible cause of the vitamin B12 deficiency. Colorectal carcinoma and De Quervain thyroiditis are not associated with vitamin B12 deficiency, while type 2 diabetes mellitus can lead to peripheral neuropathy, but not megaloblastic anemia."
