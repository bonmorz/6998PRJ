IGF1 is produced by the liver in response to GH, and both levels will be elevated in this condition. Cortisol levels may be elevated in conditions such as Cushing syndrome, but there is no indication of this in the patient\u2019s symptoms. Prolactin levels may be elevated in conditions such as prolactinoma, but this is not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient\u2019s symptoms. Low insulin levels are not a common finding in acromegaly."
