This may involve changing the patient's position or providing an intravenous fluid bolus. Administration of beta-agonists is not appropriate in this situation.

Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in management would be repositioning the patient to optimize fetal oxygenation and relieve any compression on the umbilical cord. Administration of beta-agonists would be inappropriate since they are used for fetal lung maturation and not for management of fetal distress. Operative vaginal delivery or urgent Cesarean delivery would be premature at this stage of labor."
