The clinical presentation suggests Potter sequence, which is caused by bilateral renal agenesis, resulting in oligohydramnios and compression of the fetus, leading to characteristic physical features such as low-set ears, retrognathia, and club feet, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Periportal fibrosis is a common finding in renal agenesis due to decreased urine excretion. Of the options, only bilateral renal agenesis can lead to Potter sequence, and it is not caused by a mutation on the short arm of chromosome 16 or valvular obstruction of urine outflow. Cystic dilation of collecting duct is associated with polycystic kidney disease, which is a different condition."
