The black skin lesions with central necrosis suggest cutaneous anthrax, which is caused by Bacillus anthracis, but the blood cultures are positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Decreased phagocytic cell count, which can be caused by immunosuppressive medication, can lead to increased susceptibility to infection and inability to clear the infection."

Among the options, only decreased phagocytic cell count would explain the patient\u2019s increased susceptibility to infection. Immunocompromise due to failure of immunosuppressive therapy or decreased interleukin-2 levels could also increase susceptibility to infection but do not explain the black skin lesions. DiGeorge Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the development and function of several organs, including the thymus, which can lead to immunodeficiency, but it is not related to the patient\u2019s current symptoms."
