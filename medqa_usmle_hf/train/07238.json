Based on the table, the absence of fever has the highest specificity (0.80) for ruling out appendicitis in children between the ages of 1 month and 2 years. This means that if the patient does not have a fever, the likelihood of them having appendicitis is lower compared to the other clinical findings listed in the table. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Fever."

Among the given options, the absence of fever (with a sensitivity of 0.80) would most accurately rule out appendicitis in this patient. The other clinical findings have lower sensitivity, meaning that the absence of those findings would not necessarily rule out appendicitis. For example, the absence of guarding still leaves a 30% chance of having appendicitis, while the absence of rebound still leaves a 15% chance. Therefore, fever is the most useful clinical finding in ruling out appendicitis in this patient."

The question asks for the clinical finding whose absence would most accurately rule out appendicitis. From the table, we see that fever has a sensitivity of 0.8 and a specificity of 0.8, meaning that it is a fairly accurate diagnostic indicator. However, anorexia has a much lower specificity of 0.5, meaning that a child without anorexia is much less likely to have appendicitis. Therefore, the absence of anorexia would most accurately rule out appendicitis in this patient."
