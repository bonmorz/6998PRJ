The left posterior cerebral artery supplies blood to the visual cortex and occipital lobe, which means an acute infarction in its distribution will cause right-sided homonymous hemianopia.

The given symptoms suggest that the patient has had a stroke, specifically an acute infarction in the distribution of the left posterior cerebral artery. Damage to this artery can cause a right-sided homonymous hemianopia, which is the loss of the left half of the visual field in both eyes. Left-sided gaze deviation is not typical of this type of infarction. Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize faces and is associated with damage to the fusiform gyrus, which is unlikely to be affected by this particular infarction. Right-sided superior quadrantanopia is associated with damage to the optic radiation, which is often supplied by the posterior cerebral artery, but would not cause the other symptoms mentioned in the question."
