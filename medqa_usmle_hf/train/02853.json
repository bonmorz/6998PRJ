The patient\u2019s symptoms and laboratory results indicate a diagnosis of mucolipidosis II (I-cell disease), which is caused by a defect in the targeting of lysosomal enzymes. Option C describes this mechanism, stating that lysosomal enzymes are secreted from cells instead of being targeted to lysosomes due to a lack of mannose phosphorylation on N-linked glycoproteins. Option A describes Niemann-Pick disease, which results from accumulation of sphingomyelin in lysosomes. Option B describes Tay-Sachs disease, which results from impaired hydrolysis of GM2-ganglioside. Option D describes a hypothetical condition that is not related to the patient\u2019s symptoms or laboratory results."

Without this addition, the enzymes are not targeted to lysosomes and are secreted from the cells instead. This leads to an accumulation of undegraded material in the lysosomes, causing cellular dysfunction and organ damage. The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms or laboratory findings."

This defect prevents lysosomal enzymes (including those involved in the breakdown of cellular debris) from being targeted to lysosomes, leading to their secretion outside of the cell. This, in turn, leads to the accumulation of cellular debris in the lysosomes, resulting in the many symptoms seen in this patient."
