Non-small cell lung cancer and large cell lung cancer would appear differently on the X-ray, and adenocarcinoma typically does not present with a large central mass. The low sodium level can be a result of the tumor secreting inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)."

The chest X-ray shows a mass in the right hilar region, which is highly suggestive of small cell lung cancer. The low sodium level also supports a diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, as it can commonly cause syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) resulting in hyponatremia. Non-small cell lung cancer and large cell lung cancer are less likely based on the patient's presentation and chest X-ray findings. Adenocarcinoma is not likely based on the location of the mass in the right hilar region."
