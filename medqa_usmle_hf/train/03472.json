The patient is experiencing symptoms of depression but the timeframe of one month suggests an adjustment disorder, which is a stress-related disorder that occurs within three months of a stressful event. The patient\u2019s behavior changes, such as sleeping in and not going to the gym, suggest an adjustment disorder rather than dysthymic disorder, which has a longer duration of at least 2 years. Substance use disorder and bipolar disorder can both have depressive symptoms, but the patient\u2019s marijuana use is still considered sporadic and her mood does not suggest a manic or hypomanic episode."
