The short, mildly webbed neck, and low-set ears are typical for this syndrome. The cleft palate, hypoplasia of the nails and distal phalanges, and increased coarse hair on the body and face are also common in this condition. Posterior urethral valves in the fetus can cause oligohydramnios, but they would not explain the other clinical findings. Maternal diabetes mellitus can lead to macrosomia and other fetal anomalies, but it would not explain the specific combination of findings seen in this newborn. Maternal alcohol intake can cause fetal alcohol syndrome, which can also cause a variety of fetal anomalies, but the specific findings seen in this case are not typical of fetal alcohol syndrome."
