The periorbital swelling, displacement of the globe and tenderness on the infraorbital rim suggest that the patient suffered from an orbital fracture. The clouding of the maxillary sinus can be a result of such trauma as it is closely associated with the orbital floor. Injury to the lacrimal duct system can happen in orbital fracture, but it's less likely in this case as the question does not mention any tearing or discharge from the eye. Pneumatization of frontal sinus is also less likely to be a result of trauma to the orbital floor. Disruption of medial canthal ligament is commonly associated with naso-orbito-ethmoid fractures, which is not described in this case."
