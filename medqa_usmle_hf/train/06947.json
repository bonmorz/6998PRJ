The patient has enlarged superficial veins and discoloration with indistinct margins on the ankle, suggesting chronic venous insufficiency. This can cause a buildup of pressure in the veins, leading to leakage of red blood cells and hemosiderin deposition in the skin. Bacterial spread through the superficial dermis and infection with dermatophyte would be associated with other symptoms like pain and itching, which are not present in this case. Contact of antigen with pre-sensitized T lymphocytes would suggest an allergic reaction, which is also not likely in this case."

The patient\u2019s history of applying a new lotion and the physical examination findings suggest stasis dermatitis, which is caused by chronic venous insufficiency. The red-brown discoloration is due to dermal deposition of hemosiderin, a breakdown of hemoglobin from red blood cells that have leaked from capillaries into surrounding tissues. Bacterial spread through the superficial dermis would cause a different presentation of rash and infections with dermatophyte would have different characteristics. Contact of antigen with pre-sensitized T lymphocytes is a mechanism for allergic contact dermatitis, but this is unlikely in this case."

The hemosiderin deposition is a consequence of longstanding venous insufficiency. The use of a new scented lotion may have caused contact dermatitis, but it is not the most likely cause of the skin findings. Bacterial spread and dermatophyte infection would have skin findings that look different than what is described in the question."

The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, which puts her at risk for chronic venous insufficiency. The enlarged superficial veins, red-brown discoloration, and edema in the lower extremities suggest chronic venous insufficiency as well. The dermal deposition of hemosiderin occurs when red blood cells leak out of the veins and deposit iron pigment in the tissue, resulting in the red-brown discoloration commonly seen in chronic venous insufficiency. Bacterial spread and infection with dermatophytes may result in different types of skin lesions, while contact dermatitis occurs with acute exposure to an antigen."
