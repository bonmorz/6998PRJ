The symptoms and findings suggest a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, with coarse crackles, dilated left ventricle and low ejection fraction. The irregularly irregular rhythm with absent p waves on ECG is suggestive of atrial fibrillation, which is a common cause of CHF. Chronic supraventricular tachycardia can cause remodeling of the atria and lead to the development of atrial fibrillation. Uncontrolled essential hypertension is a risk factor for CHF but does not explain the patient's symptoms. An inherited \u03b2-myosin heavy chain mutation is a cause for familial cardiomyopathy, but the presentation of the patient is not suggestive of this condition. Acute psychological stress does not explain the chronic nature of the patient's symptoms."

Uncontrolled essential hypertension may contribute to heart failure, but it is not the primary cause in this case. Inherited \u03b2-myosin heavy chain mutation is a cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but would not typically present with an irregularly irregular rhythm. Acute psychological stress may cause transient tachycardia but would not cause the persistent symptoms seen in this case."

Irregularly irregular rhythm with absent p waves suggests atrial fibrillation, which is often associated with chronic supraventricular tachycardia. Coarse crackles at the lung bases bilaterally suggest pulmonary edema, which is a common complication of heart failure. The dilated left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction also points to heart failure. Chronic supraventricular tachycardia can cause electrical remodeling of the heart that can lead to heart failure over time. Essential hypertension and inherited \u03b2-myosin heavy chain mutation can cause heart failure but they don't explain the irregular heart rhythm and lung findings.
