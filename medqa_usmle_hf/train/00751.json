The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and the fact that symptoms worsen with milk or cheese suggests lactose intolerance as a possible cause. The most likely treatment for lactose intolerance involves recommending a lactose-free diet. However, lactase supplements may be recommended to help the patient tolerate lactose-containing foods. One of the adverse effects of lactase supplements is a disulfiram-like reaction, which can cause flushing, headache, and nausea if alcohol is consumed. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) disulfiram-like reaction. Osteoporosis is not an adverse effect of lactase supplements, and photosensitivity and tendon rupture are not related to lactose intolerance or IBS."
