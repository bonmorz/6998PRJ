The patient has symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland that causes urinary symptoms. The most appropriate next step would be to perform a urinalysis to rule out infection or other causes of urinary frequency. Urine cytology is used to detect cancer, which is less likely given the patient's age and lack of other suggestive symptoms. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a screening tool for prostate cancer, but it is not indicated in this patient with BPH. Uroflowmetry is a noninvasive test to measure urinary flow rate, but it is not necessary at this time given the patient's symptoms and lack of other concerning findings."
