The patient is presenting with symptoms of a possible myocardial infarction and his medical history increases his risk. The presence of a S4 on cardiac exam raises suspicion for heart failure exacerbation. Labetalol is a beta-blocker that can reduce blood pressure and heart rate, and is a recommended first-line treatment for hypertensive emergency in patients with acute coronary syndrome. CT scan and serum lipase are not indicated in the management of acute coronary syndrome. Nitroprusside can reduce blood pressure but is not recommended in patients with acute coronary syndrome due to its potential for causing reflex tachycardia and worsening ischemia. NPO and IV fluids are not the best next step in management for this patient."
