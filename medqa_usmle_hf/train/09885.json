The patient\u2019s symptoms, including leg cramps, heavy legs, and tortuosities of the veins over the lower limb, suggest valvular incompetence of the lower limb veins and increased venous pressure. This can be caused by prolonged standing or sitting, obesity, pregnancy, and other factors that increase pressure on the lower limbs. Aging, intramural thrombus, and atherosclerosis can also contribute to venous insufficiency, but they are less likely causes given the patient\u2019s history and examination findings."
