The patient\u2019s symptoms, such as the enlarged thyroid gland, palpitations, and weight loss, suggest hyperthyroidism. The presence of exophthalmos indicates Graves\u2019 disease, which is a common cause of hyperthyroidism. The most appropriate next step is to start with propylthiouracil, which is an antithyroid medication, to reduce excess thyroid hormone production. IV hydrocortisone may be used to treat adrenal insufficiency, but there is no indication of such in the patient. Thyroid scintigraphy with I-123 may provide information on thyroid function but is not the first-line therapy. Surgical thyroidectomy may be considered in patients with large thyroid nodules or when there is a failure of medical management."

Surgery (option D) may be considered if medical management is ineffective or if there are complications such as an enlarged thyroid gland compressing nearby structures. Thyroid scintigraphy (option C) may also be considered to confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, but treatment should not be delayed while waiting for the results. IV hydrocortisone (option A) is not indicated in this case."

The thyroid gland is enlarged symmetrically, and there is an audible thyroid bruit, and exophthalmos. Propylthiouracil is a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism associated with Graves' disease. Choice A is incorrect because a high dose of glucocorticoids is typically contraindicated in this condition, as it can worsen the symptoms. Choice C is not necessary at this point because the diagnosis can be made based on clinical findings and laboratory tests. Choice D may be considered if the patient is not responsive to medical therapy or if complications arise, but it is not the first-line treatment option."

The presence of an enlarged thyroid gland, thyroid bruit, and exophthalmos suggest a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, likely Graves\u2019 disease.
