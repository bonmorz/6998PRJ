The symptoms suggest Parkinson's disease, which is caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. These neurons release dopamine, which interacts with D2 receptors on GABAergic neurons in the striatum. This inhibits the globus pallidus internus, leading to decreased inhibition of the thalamus and increased excitation of the motor cortex. This ultimately results in increased voluntary movement. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) inhibition of the globus pallidus internus."

The symptoms described in the patient are consistent with Parkinson's disease, which involves the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons that release dopamine. Dopamine interacts with D2 receptors on GABAergic neurons in the striatum, leading to inhibition of the globus pallidus internus. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).

The patient's symptoms suggest Parkinson\u2019s disease, which involves the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The substance released by these neurons is dopamine, which interacts with G-alpha-s coupled receptors. Stimulation of these receptors in the striatum inhibits the globus pallidus internus and increases activity in the thalamus, facilitating movement. In Parkinson\u2019s disease, the loss of dopamine leads to increased activity of the globus pallidus internus, inhibiting movement.

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest Parkinson's disease, which involves the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. When dopamine interacts with a D2 receptor on the globus pallidus internus, it inhibits the globus pallidus internus, leading to a disinhibition of the thalamus and an increase in voluntary movement. Therefore, the correct answer is (A). Stimulation of the globus pallidus externus would decrease involuntary movements, while stimulation of the globus pallidus internus would increase involuntary movements. Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus is used in deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease, but it does not directly relate to the interaction of dopamine and G-alpha-s coupled receptors."
