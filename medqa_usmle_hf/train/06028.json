The symptoms, especially the strong-smelling and pink-colored urine and the lack of urination, suggest urinary retention, which can be caused by a urethral obstruction. The most appropriate next step would be to perform transurethral catheterization to relieve the obstruction and obtain a urine sample for testing. Performing a renal ultrasound may be helpful to identify any structural abnormalities or urolithiasis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this situation. Administering cefixime without a proper diagnosis would not be appropriate."
