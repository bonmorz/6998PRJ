The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with acute pulmonary edema, which is caused by the transudation of plasma into the alveoli.

Localized constriction of the pulmonary vasculature and bacterial infiltration into the pulmonary parenchyma would not result in the symptoms seen in this patient. Increased permeability of pulmonary vascular endothelial cells could lead to pulmonary edema, but it is not the most likely underlying pathophysiology in this case given the patient's presentation with chest pain and ST-segment elevations."
