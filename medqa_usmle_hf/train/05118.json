The Hawthorne effect refers to a phenomenon where individuals modify or improve an aspect of their behavior in response to their awareness of being observed. This bias is most likely to occur in a study that involves passive observation of daily routine, such as in the case of this study on handwashing among healthcare workers. Observer-expectancy bias refers to the effect of the researcher's expectations on the study outcome, Berksonian bias refers to a type of selection bias, and attrition bias refers to the selective loss of participants over the course of the study."

The Hawthorne effect is the tendency for people to modify their behavior when they know they are being observed, which could potentially affect the results of this study. Observer-expectancy bias would occur if the observers had preconceived notions about the expected handwashing behavior of the healthcare workers. Berksonian bias would occur if the study only recruited patients with a certain condition and was therefore not representative of the general population. Attrition bias would occur if participants dropped out of the study before its completion, potentially skewing the results. None of the other biases are directly related to the study design described."
