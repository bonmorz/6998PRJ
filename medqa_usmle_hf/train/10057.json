RANK ligand is known to play a role in the regulation of bone metabolism, specifically in osteoclast differentiation and activation. As women age, there is an increased risk of osteoporosis due to decreased bone mass and increases in bone resorption. This process is mediated in part by RANK ligand. Therefore, the expression of RANK ligand is most likely to be increased in the cohort of older women. Demineralization of bone with normal osteoid matrix is a characteristic of osteomalacia, not osteoporosis. Urinary excretion of cyclic AMP and osteocalcin are not markers of bone metabolism regulation."
