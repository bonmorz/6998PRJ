Inulin is a fructose polysaccharide that is not metabolized by the body and only filtered in the glomerulus but not reabsorbed, secreted, or metabolized. It is thus a suitable tracer for measuring extracellular fluid volume. Albumin and urea are both metabolized, and heavy water can cross the cellular membranes, making them unsuitable for this purpose."

Among the options, only inulin is known to fit this description as it is freely filtered by the glomerulus, but it does not undergo reabsorption or secretion by the renal tubules. As a result, it remains inside the extracellular fluid and can be used to measure extracellular fluid volume. The other options have limitations in terms of permeability or specificity to the fluid compartment of interest."

Among the options, only inulin is completely filtered by the glomerulus, is not reabsorbed, secreted, or metabolized, and is therefore a reliable indicator of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and plasma volume. It meets the requirement of being capillary membrane permeable but impermeable to cellular membranes, making it the most suitable tracer for measuring the volume of a specific body fluid compartment. Albumin is a protein and cannot completely diffuse through the capillary membrane, making it unsuitable. Heavy water (D2O) and urea are permeable through both capillary and cellular membranes, making them unsuitable as well."
