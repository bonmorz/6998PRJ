The MRA shows bilateral narrowing of renal arteries, and the patient is also hypertensive. These findings suggest that the patient has renal artery stenosis. ACE inhibitors, such as captopril, are known to cause acute renal failure in patients with renal artery stenosis, due to their effects on the renal vasculature. Therefore, captopril is the most likely medication causing the patient\u2019s acute renal failure."

The patient has bilateral renal artery stenosis, which means that the medication used to treat hypertension may cause acute renal failure. Captopril is an ACE inhibitor that may cause a significant decrease in renal function in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis. Hydrochlorothiazide is also a medication that can cause decreased renal function, but it is not the best answer for this case because it is less likely to cause acute renal failure in a patient with bilateral renal artery stenosis compared to an ACE inhibitor. Verapamil and hydralazine are not commonly known to cause acute renal failure."
