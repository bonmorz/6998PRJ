The heterophile antibody test is used to diagnose the infection but can sometimes give false-negative results, especially in the early stages of the disease. The test measures antibodies that cross-react with sheep or horse erythrocytes, so low specificity is not the most likely reason for the negative test. Concurrent viral hepatitis A infection is unlikely since the serologic test for hepatitis A is negative. CMV infection is also unlikely since the serologic test for CMV is negative. Therefore, the most likely reason for the negative heterophile test is a false negative, which can occur in up to 25% of patients in the first week of illness."
