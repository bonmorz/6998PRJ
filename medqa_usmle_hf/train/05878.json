The symptoms of increased shortness of breath with exertion and occasional nonproductive cough are also consistent with COPD. The physical exam findings of decreased breath sounds bilaterally and the chest radiograph showing hyperinflation with increased lung markings support this diagnosis. One of the key diagnostic tests for COPD is spirometry, which measures the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and the forced vital capacity (FVC). The ratio of FEV1/FVC is used to determine airflow limitation. An FEV1/FVC of less than 70% is consistent with COPD. Therefore, the most likely answer to this question is (A), an FEV1/FVC of 65%. Option (B) is incorrect because total lung capacity is typically increased in COPD. Option (C) is incorrect because the diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is typically decreased in COPD. Option (D) is incorrect because an FEV1/FVC ratio of 80% with an FEV1 of 82% is normal and does not support a diagnosis of COPD."

The patient's history of smoking and increasing shortness of breath suggest the possibility of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The chest radiograph also shows hyperinflation of both lungs, which is consistent with COPD. Option A is correct because a FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 70% indicates the presence of airflow limitation, confirming the diagnosis of COPD. Option B is incorrect because decreased total lung capacity is seen in restrictive lung diseases, not COPD. Option C is incorrect because DLCO (diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide) is typically decreased in COPD, not increased. Option D is incorrect because a FEV1/FVC ratio of 80%, while normal, does not confirm or rule out the diagnosis of COPD, and the FEV1 value alone does not provide enough information to diagnose COPD."

The chest radiograph confirms hyperinflation but no focal findings. The most likely pulmonary function test finding is a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio, which indicates obstructive lung disease. Option (B) is unlikely because COPD typically leads to increased total lung capacity. Option (C) is unlikely because increased DLCO is more commonly seen in interstitial lung diseases.
