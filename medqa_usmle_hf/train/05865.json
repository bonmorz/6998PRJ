The description of the lump on the right side of the anus that is bluish and surrounded by edema suggests an external hemorrhoid. The vessels responsible for the formation of external hemorrhoids are drained by the internal pudendal vein. Therefore, the correct answer is (B). Internal hemorrhoids are formed by dilation of the superior and inferior hemorrhoidal veins, and they are not visible without an anoscope. Inferior mesenteric vein drains the left part of the transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and upper rectum. Middle rectal vein drains the lower rectum and anal canal below the pectinate line. Neither of them is responsible for external hemorrhoids."
