The symptoms and signs are consistent with neurofibromatosis type 1, which is caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene, a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 17q11.2. This gene encodes neurofibromin, a protein that helps regulate cell division and growth. NF1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and about half of affected individuals have no family history of the disorder because it can arise from a new mutation. The NF1 gene is expressed in neural crest cells, which are a transient group of embryonic cells that give rise to many different cell types, including peripheral nerves, melanocytes, and smooth muscle cells. Therefore, the most probable origin of the cells in the lump is neural crest cells."

NF-1 is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes a protein called neurofibromin. This protein is involved in the regulation of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway, which is important in the embryonic development of neural crest cells. Therefore, the most probable embryonic origin of the cells in the lump would be neural crest cells."
