The patient\u2019s symptoms of morning headaches, fatigue, and trouble concentrating, along with his wife\u2019s report of him stopping breathing while sleeping, suggest sleep apnea as the most likely cause of his hypertension. Nocturnal upper airway obstruction is a common consequence of sleep apnea. Hypophyseal neoplasm can cause hypertension, but it is less likely given the patient\u2019s other symptoms. Hypersecretion of aldosterone and overproduction of cortisol are also possibilities, but they are not the most likely cause based on the patient\u2019s symptoms."
