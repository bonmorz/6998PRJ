Based on the symptoms of a urinary tract infection and the treatment with a drug that directly inhibits bacterial DNA replication, the drug is likely to be a quinolone antibiotic. Quinolones inhibit DNA gyrase, which is responsible for cleaving DNA to relieve supercoils. This step is necessary for DNA replication to proceed successfully. Excision of RNA fragments, unwinding DNA, and preventing reannealing are other steps involved in DNA replication that are not affected by quinolones."
