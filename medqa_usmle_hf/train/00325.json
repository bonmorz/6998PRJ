The symptoms of progressive difficulty climbing stairs, problems with running, occasional falls, standing from a chair, enlarged calf muscles, and a high creatine kinase (CK) level suggest a muscular dystrophy. Genetic analysis is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis, as it can identify mutations associated with different types of muscular dystrophy. Tensilon test is used to diagnose myasthenia gravis, anti-Jo-1 antibodies measurement is used to diagnose polymyositis, and electromyography can show muscle damage but is not diagnostic for muscular dystrophy."
