Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, so it will inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to a decrease in circulating angiotensin II levels. It will also increase levels of bradykinin, which is a vasodilator. Therefore, the correct answer is (A), which states that lisinopril will increase levels of bradykinin and decrease levels of angiotensin II."

Therefore, relative to losartan, treatment with lisinopril would be expected to increase bradykinin levels and decrease angiotensin II levels. Answer choice (A) is therefore correct."
