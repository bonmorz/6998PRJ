The intracavernous carotid aneurysm is most likely compressing the abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI), which innervates the lateral rectus muscle responsible for abducting the eye. This explains the left-lateral gaze esotropia observed on exam. The oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) is responsible for medial rectus muscle function, and the superior and inferior rectus muscles, which control eye movements in other directions. The ophthalmic nerve (cranial nerve V1) is responsible for sensation in the upper face and eye. The optic nerve (cranial nerve II) is responsible for vision."

In this case, the left-sided aneurysm is most likely compressing the abducens nerve, resulting in the esotropia on left-lateral gaze. The oculomotor nerve controls most of the eye's movements and is also near the cavernous sinus, but it is not the most likely nerve to be compressed in this case. The ophthalmic nerve and optic nerve are not directly affected by the aneurysm."

The patient presents with double vision and a more pronounced esotropia on left-lateral gaze, which suggests involvement of the abducens nerve. The aneurysm is located in the cavernous sinus, which is where the abducens nerve runs. The oculomotor nerve innervates multiple extraocular muscles, including the inferior oblique muscle which elevates the eye and rotates it outwards, however, none of the symptoms suggest involvement of that nerve. The ophthalmic nerve is a sensory nerve of the trigeminal nerve and the optic nerve is responsible for vision, neither of which are involved in this case."
