The presentation of recurrent infections with S. aureus, along with a negative nitroblue tetrazolium test, suggests that the patient has a deficiency in generating a microbicidal respiratory burst. This is characteristic of chronic granulomatous disease, which is caused by defects in NADPH oxidase system in phagocytes. None of the other options are associated with this particular pathophysiological event."

The nitroblue tetrazolium test is used to measure the ability of neutrophils to generate the microbicidal respiratory burst. Therefore, the most likely key pathophysiologic event responsible for the findings in this patient is an inability to generate the microbicidal respiratory burst. This condition is known as chronic granulomatous disease and is caused by a defect in the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex. It results in recurrent infections, particularly with catalase-positive organisms like Staphylococcus aureus. Tyrosine kinase deficiency blocking B cell maturation is seen in X-linked agammaglobulinemia, MHC class-II deficiency is seen in bare lymphocyte syndrome, and inability to fuse lysosomes with phagosomes is seen in Chediak-Higashi syndrome, all of which can also result in recurrent infections, but are not associated with the nitroblue tetrazolium test."
