Lansoprazole, however, has been shown to inhibit calcium absorption and increase the risk of osteoporosis, making it the most likely culprit."

The long-term use of proton pump inhibitors, such as lansoprazole, is associated with an increased risk of hip fractures due to decreased calcium absorption in the gut.

Lithium can also cause bone loss, but the patient was only on it for 2 years, whereas she took lansoprazole often for a longer time period. Estrogen, on the other hand, is known to have a protective effect on bones, so it is unlikely to have contributed to the osteoporosis."
