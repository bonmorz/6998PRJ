Pooled analysis combines data from multiple studies to increase sample size and provide more precise estimates of effects. However, it may not be able to resolve differences in outcomes between individual studies and does not necessarily overcome limitations in the quality of individual studies. Additionally, there may be an increased risk of type I error if multiple tests are performed on the combined data. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer."
