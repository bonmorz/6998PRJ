The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings indicate diabetes insipidus, which is caused by a lack of production of or response to antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that can decrease urine volume by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and water in the distal tubule of the kidney. Desmopressin is a synthetic form of ADH and would be ineffective in this case. Further water restriction would only worsen the patient's symptoms. Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic that would not be effective in treating diabetes insipidus."

Further water restriction or amiloride therapy may exacerbate the patient's symptoms, and desmopressin therapy is not effective in this case."

Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide can help decrease urine output and improve symptoms. Further water restriction may not be effective, and amiloride therapy is typically used in primary or congenital forms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, rather than secondary forms like in this patient.

Hydrochlorothiazide therapy is used to treat nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which is the most likely cause in this case given the patient\u2019s history of polycystic kidney disease and the lack of response to desmopressin."
