The patient\u2019s symptoms, including red urine, headaches, and blurry vision, suggest hypertension-related kidney disease.

The patient\u2019s risk factors, including obesity and long-term smoking, also support this diagnosis. Nephrolithiasis could also cause hematuria, but the presence of RBC casts would suggest this instead. Transitional cell bladder carcinoma is less likely given the absence of bladder-related symptoms and findings on examination. Renal oncocytoma is a benign tumor that typically does not cause hematuria."
