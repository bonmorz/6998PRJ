The symptoms suggest Hirschsprung disease, which is caused by impaired migration of neural crest cells, leading to absence of ganglion cells in the distal bowel and resulting in functional obstruction. Ischemic necrosis of the intestinal mucosa would be unlikely in a newborn without other risk factors. Incomplete coiling of the intestine can lead to malrotation, which can also cause bowel obstruction, but would not cause absence of ganglion cells. Mutation in the CFTR gene can cause cystic fibrosis, but does not typically present with functional bowel obstruction in the newborn period."
