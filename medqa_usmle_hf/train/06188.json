The findings suggest hemolytic anemia, as seen by the low hemoglobin, high bilirubin, increased LDH, and nontender splenomegaly. The red cell distribution width is also elevated, which is indicative of anisocytosis. Among the options, only decreased spectrin in the RBC membrane is a possible cause of this presentation, as it can lead to increased fragility of RBCs and hemolysis. Increased hemoglobin S would present as sickle cell anemia with a different set of laboratory findings. Decreased synthesis of alpha chains of hemoglobin would present as alpha-thalassemia, which typically doesn't cause splenomegaly. Deficiency of pyruvate kinase would present with variable hemolysis, but typically without jaundice or splenomegaly."

The nontender splenomegaly indicates that red blood cells are being sequestered in the spleen. The laboratory results show elevated lactate dehydrogenase and indirect bilirubin, which are also indicative of hemolysis. All of these symptoms and findings are characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis, which is caused by a defect in the RBC membrane proteins, such as spectrin. Therefore, the most likely pathophysiology of these findings is decreased spectrin in the RBC membrane."

The clinical presentation suggests hemolytic anemia, and the laboratory findings show evidence of hemolysis (elevated bilirubin and LDH, low hemoglobin). The nontender splenomegaly also supports this diagnosis. The correct answer is therefore a defect in the RBC membrane, which can lead to increased susceptibility to hemolysis. Decreased spectrin is one of the causes of RBC membrane defects. Increased hemoglobin S would suggest sickle cell anemia, which is not supported by the laboratory findings. Decreased synthesis of alpha chains of hemoglobin would suggest alpha-thalassemia, which is not supported by the laboratory findings. Deficiency of pyruvate kinase would suggest a cause of hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia, but this diagnosis requires more information about the patient's family history."

The MCV is normal, ruling out decreased synthesis of alpha chains of hemoglobin and deficiency of pyruvate kinase. Increased hemoglobin S is not relevant in this case.
