The patient presents with symptoms of shortness of breath and a holodiastolic murmur, indicating potential cardiac involvement. The widened mediastinum on the chest x-ray raises concern for syphilitic aortitis, hence, the Treponemal test is the most appropriate diagnostic test to confirm the diagnosis.

The patient has symptoms of heart failure, potentially caused by infective endocarditis due to his history of HIV and missed doses of antiretroviral therapy. The holodiastolic murmur and widening of the mediastinum suggest aortic regurgitation, which can also be caused by infective endocarditis. The lack of reaction to light and loss of balance suggest neurosyphilis, which can also occur in patients with HIV. Therefore, the most appropriate confirmatory test is a treponemal test, which can detect antibodies to the bacterium that causes syphilis. All other options are not relevant to the patient's presentation."
