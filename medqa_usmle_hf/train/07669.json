Cricothyroidotomy is the indicated action in this case, as it is a surgical airway performed through an incision in the cricothyroid membrane that can bypass upper airway obstruction. Endotracheal intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be necessary in other cases, but in this specific scenario, cricothyroidotomy is the best option. Nasogastric tube is not indicated in managing airway obstruction."
