Endometrial gland invasion into the uterine myometrium causes adenomyosis, extra-uterine endometrial gland formation causes endometriosis, and intrauterine adhesions cause Asherman syndrome, all of which can cause painful periods but have different characteristics and symptoms. However, pelvic ultrasound may be needed to confirm the diagnosis."
