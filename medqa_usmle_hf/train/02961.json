The symptoms suggest a diagnosis of pyloric stenosis, which is confirmed by the presence of a palpable mass in the epigastric region. The electrolyte abnormalities, particularly the low potassium level, indicate dehydration and alkalosis. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer IV fluids (0.9% NaCl) to correct dehydration and replace electrolytes. Emergency pyloromyotomy may be needed if the patient does not respond to IV fluid therapy. CT scan of the abdomen with contrast is not necessary for the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis. Serum cortisol levels are not relevant to the diagnosis or management of pyloric stenosis."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest pyloric stenosis, with vomiting, hunger after vomiting, and a palpable round mass in the epigastric region. Laboratory studies show low chloride and potassium levels, which is common in pyloric stenosis. The most appropriate next step in the management of the patient is to administer IV 0.9% NaCl and replace electrolytes to correct the patient\u2019s electrolyte imbalances before proceeding with further management. Option B, performing emergency pyloromyotomy, is a treatment for pyloric stenosis but is not the immediate next step in this patient. Option C, obtaining a CT scan of the abdomen, may be done later to confirm the diagnosis but is not necessary for initial management. Option D, measuring serum cortisol levels, is unrelated to the patient\u2019s symptoms and is not necessary for management of pyloric stenosis."

The initial management should start with IV fluid and electrolyte replacement to correct the dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.
