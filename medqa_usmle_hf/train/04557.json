The patient presents with a history of multiple episodes of depressive and hypomanic symptoms, indicating a cyclothymic disorder. The patient\u2019s energy level after sleeping only 3 hours, going long periods without eating, and attending yoga classes on the weekends suggest hypomanic symptoms. The depressive symptoms with increased appetite and difficulty sleeping suggest a depressive episode. Major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern and major depressive disorder with atypical features do not fit the patient\u2019s symptoms. Persistent depressive disorder may have been a consideration, but the presence of hypomanic symptoms rules it out."

The patient has a history of both depressive and manic episodes, with symptoms including increased energy and decreased need for sleep, suggesting bipolar disorder. Cyclothymic disorder is a milder form of bipolar disorder and is characterized by multiple periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a full-blown episode of mania or major depression.  Major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern refers to recurring depressive episodes that occur at the same time of the year, typically in the fall or winter. Persistent depressive disorder is a chronic form of depression characterized by persistent low mood that lasts for at least 2 years. Major depressive disorder with atypical features is characterized by symptoms including mood reactivity, increased appetite or weight gain, hypersomnia, leaden paralysis, and interpersonal rejection sensitivity."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest that she has been experiencing mood swings, including periods of high energy and lack of need for sleep, which is consistent with cyclothymic disorder. This disorder is characterized by chronic fluctuations between hypomanic and depressive symptoms but not severe enough to meet criteria for bipolar disorder. The symptoms suggest that major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern or major depressive disorder with atypical features are less likely. Persistent depressive disorder may be considered if the symptoms persist for at least 2 years, which is not the case for this patient."
