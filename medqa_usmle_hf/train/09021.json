The skin findings described in the question, erythema and prominent pitting of the hair follicles, are consistent with inflammatory breast cancer. This is a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer that is often associated with lymphatic obstruction, which can lead to edema and redness of the skin. Therefore, obstruction of the lymphatic channels is the most likely explanation for this patient's skin findings. Bacterial invasion of the subcutaneous tissue may cause cellulitis, but this is typically not associated with cancer. Involution of the breast parenchyma and ductal system and infiltration of the lactiferous ducts are not associated with the skin findings described."
