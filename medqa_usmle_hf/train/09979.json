Ectopic pregnancy can cause pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding, but it is not associated with yellowish vaginal discharge or cervical motion tenderness. Bacterial vaginosis can cause a yellowish discharge and a fishy odor on whiff test, but it is not associated with pelvic pain or cervical motion tenderness. A urinary tract infection typically causes dysuria, frequency, and urgency, but not pelvic pain or vaginal discharge."

The patient presents with chronic pelvic pain, yellowish discharge, and tender adnexa and uterus with cervical motion tenderness.

The fact that the patient has had multiple sexual partners and does not use contraception also increases her risk for PID. Ectopic pregnancy and urinary tract infection do not present with these symptoms, and bacterial vaginosis may be associated with a positive Whiff test and a vaginal pH greater than 4.5, but does not usually cause pelvic pain."
