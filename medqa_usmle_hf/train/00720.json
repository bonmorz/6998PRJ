The patient is at an increased risk for chromosomal abnormalities given her advanced age and her sister's child with Down syndrome. Beta-hCG is a marker for Down syndrome, and PAPP-A is low in mothers carrying a fetus with Down syndrome. Chorionic villus sampling with subsequent cell culturing and karyotyping is the best option for definitive diagnosis. Ultrasound examination with nuchal translucency and crown-rump length measurement can also be performed, but it is not as definitive as chorionic villus sampling."

The fact that the patient's elder sister has a child born with Down syndrome further elevates this risk. Chorionic villus sampling is the most appropriate next step in management as it can provide a definitive diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities. Option A may be considered as a screening test but it does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Option B is a useful test, but it does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Option D is a screening test and is typically performed between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. However, given the patient's increased risk, a more definitive test is needed."
