The physical exam findings, laboratory results, and symptoms suggest Klinefelter syndrome, which is caused by a chromosomal anomaly where there is an extra X chromosome, resulting in XXY instead of the normal XY. In Klinefelter syndrome, there is an inactivated X-chromosome (Barr body) visible in cells. Therefore, the correct answer is (A). Absence of a barr body is seen in males, as they only have one X chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes, and one is inactivated. The absence of a second sex chromosome (C) and trisomy 13 (D) are not associated with Klinefelter syndrome."
