The symptoms, including difficulty maintaining balance while walking and unintentional voiding of urine, suggest a possible intracranial process affecting the cerebrospinal fluid flow. Dilated ventricles are often seen on MRI in such cases, and the treatment would involve ventricular shunting to relieve pressure and improve CSF flow. Constricted ventricles are often seen in conditions such as normal pressure hydrocephalus, which may also require ventricular shunting. Surgical resection is not typically indicated in these cases. Watch and wait is not appropriate in cases where there is suspicion for an intracranial process, as delay in diagnosis and treatment can lead to significant morbidity and mortality."
