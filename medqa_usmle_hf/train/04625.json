The patient\u2019s symptoms, including pallor, decreased sensation, cool temperature, pain, and thready radial pulse, suggest compartment syndrome. Fasciotomy is the definitive treatment for compartment syndrome, and should be performed as soon as possible to prevent further damage to the muscles and nerves in the affected area. IV fluids and analgesics may be given as supportive therapy, but will not address the underlying problem of compartment syndrome. Pressure measurement may help confirm the diagnosis of compartment syndrome, but treatment should not be delayed for this test."
