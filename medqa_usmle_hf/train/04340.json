The patient does not have any signs of severe preeclampsia or eclampsia (e.g. proteinuria, visual changes, hyperreflexia, etc.), but her blood pressure is elevated. Thus, observation in the outpatient setting is the best initial management strategy. However, close monitoring with weekly follow-ups is necessary. Treatment with anti-hypertensive medications may be necessary if blood pressure remains elevated or if signs of severe preeclampsia develop. Labetalol and nifedipine are both options for treatment if needed, but they should be managed by an obstetrician."
