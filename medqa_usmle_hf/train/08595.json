The patient presented with chest pain and ST-segment elevation with Q waves on ECG, which suggests a myocardial infarction. Four days later, he developed altered mental status and low blood pressure with jugular venous distention, pulsus paradoxus, and distant heart sounds, suggesting cardiac tamponade. Blood in the pericardial space can compress and obstruct the heart chambers, leading to decreased cardiac output and low blood pressure. This is a possible complication of a myocardial infarction."

The ST-segment elevation with newly developing Q waves on the ECG suggests an acute myocardial infarction, which can lead to pericardial effusion and subsequent tamponade. The symptoms described in the question, including altered mental status, low blood pressure, jugular venous distention, pulsus paradoxus, and distant heart sounds, are all classic signs of cardiac tamponade, which is caused by compression of the heart chambers by blood in the pericardial space. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is compression of the heart chambers by blood in the pericardial space, which results in cardiac tamponade."

The sudden onset of altered mental status and hypotension indicates cardiac tamponade, in which blood in the pericardial space compresses the heart chambers and decreases cardiac output. This can cause jugular venous distention and distant heart sounds. Acute pulmonary edema and ventricular fibrillation may also result from myocardial infarction, but they do not present with the same physical examination findings as cardiac tamponade. Pericardial inflammation may cause chest pain, but it does not usually lead to sudden hypotension and altered mental status."

The patient's symptoms suggest cardiac tamponade, which is caused by compression of the heart chambers by blood in the pericardial space. The ECG changes and chest pain were likely due to a myocardial infarction, which could have led to the development of cardiac tamponade. Acute pulmonary edema can cause similar symptoms, but the presence of a distended neck vein and pulsus paradoxus suggest tamponade instead. Ventricular fibrillation could cause altered mental status and hypotension, but is less likely given that the patient was stable for 4 days prior. Pericardial inflammation can cause pericarditis, but would not lead to the rapid onset of altered mental status and hypotension seen in this case."
