The peroneal nerve innervates several muscles, including the muscles that help with dorsiflexion of the foot. Therefore, impaired dorsiflexion of the foot is the most likely finding on physical examination. Loss of sensation over the medial calf may suggest tibial nerve injury, inability to stand on tiptoes may suggest gastrocnemius weakness, and decreased ankle reflex may suggest a lower motor neuron lesion, but none of these are as likely as impaired dorsiflexion given the history of fibula fracture."

Since the patient had a fracture of the neck of the left fibula, it is likely that the peroneal nerve was injured, which innervates the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion of the foot. Thus, impaired dorsiflexion of the foot is the most likely finding. Loss of sensation over the medial calf would result from injury to the saphenous nerve, which is not typically associated with this fracture. Inability to stand on tiptoes would be a consequence of an Achilles tendon tear or rupture, which is not relevant to this fracture. Decreased ankle reflex may be seen in a variety of neurologic conditions, but is not specific to this presentation."
