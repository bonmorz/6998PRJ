The symptoms of not talking, avoiding eye contact, and preferring to play alone are common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Violent outbursts can also occur. No physical abnormalities are noted, so option B (Cri-du-chat syndrome) can be ruled out. Oppositional Defiant Disorder involves disruptive and defiant behaviors, which is not described in the patient's presentation. Rett Syndrome usually presents with physical abnormalities and developmental regression, and it is more common in females."
