The patient's symptoms and rash suggest the most likely cause is Parvovirus arthritis, which commonly presents with joint pain and rash. Psoriatic arthritis typically presents with nail changes and skin lesions, which the patient does not have. Disseminated gonococcal disease usually presents with symptoms of arthritis and skin lesions, but the patient denies having urethritis or cervicitis. Rheumatoid arthritis may present with similar symptoms, but laboratory studies would typically show abnormalities in anti-citrullinated protein antibodies or rheumatoid factor."
