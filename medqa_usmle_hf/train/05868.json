In a trauma patient, the first physiological response is usually an increase in heart rate due to the body's natural response of activating the sympathetic nervous system in response to stress or injury. Increased capillary refill time and decreased systolic blood pressure are signs of shock, which may develop later on. Increased respiratory rate may occur as a result of respiratory distress, but it is not the first physiological response to trauma."
