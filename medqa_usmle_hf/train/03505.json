The drooping of the right side of the face, decreased muscle strength on the right, and increased reflexes on the right suggest an infarction in the posterior limb of the left internal capsule, which is responsible for motor function. The base of the left pons is responsible for sensation and taste. The left lateral medulla is responsible for blood pressure and respiratory function. The left cerebellar vermis is responsible for coordination and balance."

The location of the infarction can help determine the cause of the symptoms. The most likely location based on the symptoms described is the posterior limb of the left internal capsule, which is responsible for motor function in the contralateral (opposite) side of the body. The other options are also possible sites of infarction but would lead to different symptoms, such as difficulty with coordination or sensory deficits."
