The patient suffered a fall and has symptoms of urinary and fecal incontinence, bilateral lower extremity weakness, and decreased rectal tone, which suggest conus medullaris syndrome. Spinal epidural abscess and anterior spinal cord syndrome can also cause similar symptoms, but they usually present with severe back pain. Cerebellar stroke would not present with symptoms of urinary and fecal incontinence. The ultrasound of the bladder confirms that the bladder is full, which also supports the diagnosis of conus medullaris syndrome."

The patient\u2019s symptoms of urinary and fecal incontinence, tenderness over the lumbar spine, bilateral lower extremity weakness, absent ankle jerk reflexes, decreased rectal tone, and a full bladder on ultrasound suggest conus medullaris syndrome. Option A, spinal epidural abscess, can also cause similar symptoms but the ultrasound shows a full bladder, while in spinal epidural abscess, there can be urinary retention. Option B, cerebellar stroke, does not match the symptoms. Option D, anterior spinal cord syndrome, presents with loss of motor and sensory function below the level of the lesion, which is not seen in this patient."

The patient shows signs of conus medullaris syndrome, which is characterized by lower extremity weakness, absent ankle jerk reflexes, and decreased rectal tone. The full bladder seen on ultrasound is consistent with urinary incontinence. These symptoms are typically caused by injury or compression of the lower spinal cord, which often occurs with trauma to the back. Spinal epidural abscess and anterior spinal cord syndrome can also cause neurologic deficits, but they typically present with different patterns of weakness and reflex changes. A cerebellar stroke would not typically cause urinary or fecal incontinence."
