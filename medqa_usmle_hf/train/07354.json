Beta-lactam antibiotics are commonly used to treat various bacterial infections, particularly those caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Adding a bulky side chain that inhibits the access of bacterial enzymes to the beta-lactam ring makes it less susceptible to beta-lactamase degradation, increasing its efficacy against resistant strains. Among the options, folliculitis is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which is susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. Nocardiosis is mainly treated with sulfonamides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and extended courses of antibiotics such as ampicillin, not penicillin. Atypical pneumonia can be caused by various bacteria and is generally not treated with beta-lactam antibiotics alone. Otitis media is often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, which can develop beta-lactam resistance, making it less effective."
