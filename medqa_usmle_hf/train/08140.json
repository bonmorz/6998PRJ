The presence of vulvar ulcers and cervicitis suggest a possible sexually transmitted infection, with the most likely candidate being herpes simplex virus type 2. Direct fluorescence antigen testing of the ulcer will be the most useful in identifying the specific organism causing the symptoms. Serology testing may not be helpful at this early stage, and culture in Thayer-Martin agar may take too long to provide a diagnosis. The location of the lesions may give clues to the type of infection, but it is not definitive enough to identify the specific organism."

The pelvic examination reveals vulvar ulcers and ulcerative cervicitis, which are consistent with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Direct fluorescence antigen (DFA) testing is the preferred method for rapid detection of HSV in clinical specimens. Serology is not useful for acute diagnosis of herpes infection. Culture in Thayer-Martin agar is used primarily for detecting Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The location of the lesions is helpful in determining the possible causative agent, but only direct testing with DFA can confirm the diagnosis. Therefore, answer (B) is the correct choice."
