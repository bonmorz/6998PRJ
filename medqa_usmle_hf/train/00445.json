The symptoms, including the abdominal pain, confusion, and tingling, suggest acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), especially given the patient's history of alcohol consumption.

Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug and is not indicated for AIP. Glucose may exacerbate AIP symptoms and is not recommended."

The symptoms suggest acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), as it can cause abdominal pain, neurological symptoms, and hallucinations.
