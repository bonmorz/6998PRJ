Based on the patient's history of incomplete tetanus vaccination, the presence of a contaminated wound, and symptoms of tetanus, the next best step in management would be administration of tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) along with tetanus-diphtheria vaccine (Td). Tdap would be recommended in a patient who has not received a pertussis-containing vaccine, but this is not the case here. DTaP is not recommended for use in adults."
