A peripheral blood smear can indicate a number of different conditions including sickle cell disease, which is particularly common among African Americans. However, the possible mechanisms for the patient's disease cannot be inferred from the information given. It is important to note, however, that sickle cell disease is caused by a single amino acid substitution (missense mutation) of valine for glutamic acid in the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin."

The patient likely has sickle cell disease, given the combination of symptoms, family history, and the peripheral blood smear. Sickle cell disease is caused by a missense mutation, specifically a single nucleotide substitution that results in a change in the amino acid sequence of the beta-globin protein. This change leads to the formation of abnormal hemoglobin molecules that can cause red blood cells to become sickle-shaped and cause various complications. Frameshift mutations and silent mutations are less likely to cause sickle cell disease. Mismatch repair is not directly related to sickle cell disease."
