The MRI image shows multiple hyperintense lesions in the cerebral white matter, which is a characteristic finding in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The patient has HIV and a low CD4 count, which increases the risk of PML. The other options are less likely, as there is no evidence of cryptococcal infection or lymphoma, and the clinical presentation is not typical of HIV encephalopathy."

The patient\u2019s history of HIV, noncompliance with medications, and neurological symptoms suggest a neurological complication of HIV. Among the options, only Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is associated with HIV and has the characteristic findings of increased signal intensity in the white matter on MRI. The patient\u2019s CD4+ count is also very low, which increases the risk of developing PML. Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis would have a positive cryptococcal antigen, but the patient\u2019s is negative. Primary CNS lymphoma may cause neurologic symptoms but would show a solid tumor mass on MRI rather than increased signal intensity in the white matter."
