Hematuria and envelope-shaped crystals in the urine suggest the presence of uric acid that results from the breakdown of purine.

Gout can also cause the formation of uric acid stones, but it is less likely to contribute to the patient\u2019s other symptoms. Diabetes mellitus can lead to renal complications but is not directly related to kidney stone formation. The patient's medications (insulin, allopurinol, and sulfasalazine) do not have a known association with kidney stones."
