The fact that she is experiencing headaches and fatigue suggests that her body is having trouble managing the high levels of glucose in her bloodstream. Additionally, her fasting glucose level is significantly elevated. Stress may contribute to her symptoms, but it is not the underlying mechanism of her hyperglycemia. Testing for cortisol levels would be needed to determine if hypersecretion of ACTH is the cause of her symptoms, and there is no mention of such testing in the scenario. Decreased insulin production is a possible cause of hyperglycemia, but it is not the most likely mechanism in this case."

Additionally, the patient drinks alcohol and smokes cigarettes, which are also risk factors for insulin resistance. While stress can cause hyperglycemia, it is less likely to be the primary cause in this patient as her symptoms have persisted for a month. Hypersecretion of ACTH would suggest Cushing's disease, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms or laboratory values. Decreased insulin production is not the most likely mechanism as the patient's hyperglycemia is mild and would typically present with more severe symptoms in cases of decreased insulin production. Therefore, insulin resistance is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's hyperglycemia."
