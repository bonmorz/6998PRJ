The patient has a family history suggesting hereditary disorders and physical examination shows a slit-lamp exam revealing features of Marfan syndrome.

Skin biopsy can confirm the diagnosis of Alport syndrome through electron microscopy showing abnormal collagen IV in the skin basement membrane. Urinary creatinine, upright KUB radiograph, and renal ultrasound are unlikely to aid in the diagnosis of Alport syndrome."

Urinary creatinine and KUB radiograph do not relate to EDS or the patient's symptoms. A renal ultrasound can be used to evaluate renal function, but it is not necessary for diagnosis of EDS."
