Contrast MRI of the head may not be necessary at this point since the T2 MRI already shows ventriculomegaly. Brain biopsy is not needed as NPH can be diagnosed with non-invasive tests. Serum ceruloplasmin level is used to diagnose Wilson's disease, which does not fit with the patient's symptoms."

This can help confirm the diagnosis of NPH and determine if a shunt placement is necessary. Contrast MRI of the head is not necessary in this case as the non-contrast MRI has already shown imaging findings characteristic of NPH. Brain biopsy is not needed as the diagnosis can be made through clinical findings and imaging studies. Serum ceruloplasmin level is not relevant in this case as this condition is not associated with Wilson's disease."
