The patient's presentation is consistent with Angelman syndrome, which is most often caused by paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15. Chromosomal macrodeletions on chromosome 5 can cause Cri-du-chat syndrome, which typically presents with high-pitched cries and distinct facial features. Maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 can cause Prader-Willi syndrome, which is characterized by hyperphagia and obesity. Trinucleotide repeat disorders can cause various neurodegenerative diseases, but the patient's presentation is not consistent with any specific trinucleotide repeat disorder."

The patient has symptoms consistent with Angelman syndrome, including developmental delay, seizures, ataxic gait with flapping of the hands, and frequent smiling. Angelman syndrome is caused by a deletion or inactivation of the maternal copy of UBE3A gene on chromosome 15. Paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 is a genetic abnormality where both copies of chromosome 15 are inherited from the father, resulting in the absence of the maternal copy of UBE3A gene. Therefore, the answer is (C)."
