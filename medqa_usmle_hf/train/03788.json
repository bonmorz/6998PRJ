The goal of the rapid diagnostic test is to identify all exposed individuals to curb the spread of the virus, so it's important to have a test with high sensitivity (true positive rate). In this case, the sensitivity of the test (which correctly identified those with avian influenza) is 95/100, making option (D) the correct answer. Specificity (true negative rate) is also important for accuracy, but it is not directly related to containing the spread of the virus."

PPV is the likelihood that a positive test result indicates true disease, while NPV is the likelihood that a negative test result indicates the absence of disease. \n\nPPV = true positives / (true positives + false positives) = 95 / (95 + 2) = 0.9792\nNPV = true negatives / (true negatives + false negatives) = 98 / (98 + 5) = 0.9512\n\nThe objective is to identify all exposed individuals, so a high sensitivity is important for minimizing false negatives. Out of all individuals with the disease (true positives + false negatives), the sensitivity is 95/100 = 0.95, which suggests that the rapid diagnostic test can correctly identify nearly all individuals with the disease. Therefore, the answer is (D) sensitivity of 95/100."
