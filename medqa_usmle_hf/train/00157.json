The patient's symptoms suggest that he has Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, which is characterized by ascending motor weakness and paresthesias. Foot drop indicates weakness of the muscles that dorsiflex the foot, which are innervated by the peroneal nerve. The first dorsal webspace of the foot is innervated by the deep peroneal nerve, which is a branch of the common peroneal nerve. Therefore, the patient would most likely have diminished sensation in the first dorsal webspace of the foot."
