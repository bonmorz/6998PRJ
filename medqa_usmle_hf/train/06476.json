Among the options, the most likely medication started would be Sertraline, as it is commonly used to treat depression in patients with bipolar disorder. Lithium is also used to treat bipolar disorder, but the patient's manic symptoms were not mentioned as being present on day 3. Olanzapine and Quetiapine are atypical antipsychotic medications used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but may not be the first-line treatment in a patient with bipolar disorder who presents with depressive symptoms."

The fact that the patient then experienced severe depression suggests bipolar disorder with a rapid cycling pattern. Lithium, Olanzapine, and Quetiapine are all options for bipolar disorder treatment, but Sertraline is not recommended as it can trigger manic episodes. Therefore, the most likely medication started in this patient is not Sertraline."
