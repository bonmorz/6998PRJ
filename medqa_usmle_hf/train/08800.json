The patient's symptoms of recurrent palpitations, chest pain, and a holosystolic murmur with a mid-systolic click suggest myxomatous valve degeneration, specifically mitral valve prolapse. Ectopic production of serotonin can cause carcinoid syndrome, which presents with flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing. Inflammatory valve degeneration is seen in infective endocarditis, but the patient has not had any recent infections. Overproduction of catecholamines is seen in pheochromocytoma, which typically presents with hypertension and palpitations. While the patient has hypertension, the other features do not fit with the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma."
