Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of carbon dioxide and water to form carbonic acid, which then dissociates into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. It lowers the activation energy required for this reaction, thus increasing the rate at which the reaction occurs. This allows for efficient control of blood pH by regulating the amount of carbon dioxide in the body. Therefore, the correct answer is (A), lowers the activation energy."

This reaction is a reversible reaction that reaches equilibrium, with the ratio of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate ions determining the pH of the blood. Carbonic anhydrase lowers the activation energy required for this reaction, which accelerates the reaction kinetics and helps maintain proper blood pH. Option (B) is incorrect because carbonic anhydrase does not change the delta G of the reaction, but rather speeds up the reaction to reach equilibrium faster. Option (C) is incorrect because carbonic anhydrase actually lowers the activation energy required for the reaction. Option (D) is incorrect as it refers to the free energy of products, which is not relevant to the role of carbonic anhydrase in controlling blood pH."

Carbonic anhydrase speeds up the reaction between CO2 and H2O by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to occur.
