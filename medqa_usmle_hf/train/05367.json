The patient presents signs of diabetic ketoacidosis, including high serum glucose, fruity odor breath, and prolonged capillary refill. The initial management for diabetic ketoacidosis is to administer IV fluids, and then followed by intravenous regular insulin, which is the correct answer. Subcutaneous insulin glargine would not act fast enough to decrease the high serum glucose levels. Subcutaneous insulin lispro may be used in the management of diabetes, but not specifically in the acute management of diabetic ketoacidosis. Intravenous glucagon is not indicated for managing diabetic ketoacidosis."
