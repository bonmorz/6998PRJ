Option B lists all of these options, making it the correct answer. Option A includes a beta-blocker, which is no longer recommended as a first-line treatment option. Option C includes a loop diuretic, which is recommended for patients with heart failure or chronic kidney disease, but not necessarily as a first-line treatment option for hypertension. Option D includes an alpha-blocker, which may be used for patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or Raynaud's syndrome, but is not recommended as a first-line treatment option for hypertension."

Option (A) is incorrect as both an ACE inhibitor and an ARB are included, which is not recommended as they have similar mechanisms of action. Option (C) and (D) are also incorrect as loop diuretics are not recommended as a first-line treatment for hypertension."
