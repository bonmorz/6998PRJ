The symptoms suggest that the patient may have cat-scratch disease, a bacterial infection caused by Bartonella henselae. The presence of a recent kitten bite and a tender, warm, and mobile mass on her neck support this diagnosis. Warthin-Starry silver stain is the most appropriate diagnostic study to confirm the presence of the bacteria. Culture for facultative anaerobes and histologic evaluation for Reed-Sternburg cells are not relevant to cat-scratch disease. Toxoplasma IgG using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is not appropriate as it measures an antibody to a different pathogen."
