The patient is exhibiting classic signs of cocaine intoxication, including agitation, tachycardia, hypertension, and delusions of grandeur. The thin nasal mucosa oozing blood is also a sign of cocaine use. Phencyclidine (PCP) can cause similar symptoms, but it is less likely given the absence of horizontal and vertical nystagmus, which is a common physical exam finding in PCP intoxication. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) intoxication generally does not cause symptoms as severe as those exhibited by the patient. Thyrotoxicosis may cause agitation and altered mental status, but it is less likely given the absence of symptoms such as weight loss, heat intolerance, and tremors."
