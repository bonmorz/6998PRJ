The decreased sensation to pinprick, light touch, and vibration over the soles of both feet, along with the nontender ulcer on the plantar surface of the left foot, suggest peripheral neuropathy. Increased protein deposition in endoneural vessel walls is a common finding in diabetic neuropathy, making option B the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms.

This damage results in increased protein deposition in endoneural vessel walls, leading to decreased sensation and neuropathy in the feet. Accumulation of lipids and foam cells in arteries is associated with atherosclerosis, which can cause peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and usually presents with claudication. Osmotic damage to oligodendrocyte nerve sheaths is not relevant to this case. Elevated hydrostatic pressure in arteriolar lumen is associated with edema or high blood pressure, not nerve damage."
