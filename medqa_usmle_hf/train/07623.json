The treatment for this disease targets thyroperoxidase, or TPO, which is involved in the production of thyroid hormones. TPO antibodies are often present in patients with Grave\u2019s disease. TPO antibodies cause inflammation of the thyroid gland and interfere with its function, leading to hyperthyroidism. Anti-thyroid medications such as methimazole and propylthiouracil work by inhibiting TPO, which reduces the production of thyroid hormones."
