The next step should be to perform ultrasonography to assess fetal position and rule out any other complications before deciding on the management. External cephalic version is not appropriate in this case as the fetal position is inconclusive. Misoprostol and oxytocin can be used for induction of labor, but they should be used with caution in preterm labor. The priority is to assess fetal well-being and position before deciding on the management plan."
