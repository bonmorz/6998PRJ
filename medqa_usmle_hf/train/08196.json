The iron and ferritin levels are within normal range, ruling out iron-deficiency anemia. Given that the patient is African-American, sickle cell anemia should be considered and a hemoglobin electrophoresis should be done to confirm the diagnosis. Anticardiolipin antibody titers would not be helpful in this case as the patient does not have any symptoms or history suggestive of antiphospholipid syndrome. Amniocentesis and direct Coombs test are also not indicated based on the information provided."

The patient has a low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels indicating anemia, and the MCV and MCH suggest microcytic, hypochromic anemia, which is commonly caused by iron deficiency anemia. However, the patient\u2019s iron and ferritin levels are normal, which could be due to other causes of microcytic anemia, such as thalassemia. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform hemoglobin electrophoresis to rule out thalassemia, which is more common in individuals of African descent. The other options are not indicated based on the patient\u2019s presentation and laboratory findings."
