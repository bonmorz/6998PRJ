The symptoms and laboratory findings suggest that the patient has severe malaria, which can cause severe complications such as anemia and kidney failure. The best treatment for severe malaria is a combination of atovaquone-proguanil, which is recommended by WHO for regions where multidrug-resistant malaria is prevalent. Chloroquine is not effective against multidrug-resistant malaria, and primaquine is used for preventing relapse of malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium ovale. Chloramphenicol is not recommended for malaria treatment."
