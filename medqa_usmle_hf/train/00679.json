The patient's irregular menstrual bleeding and normal pelvic examination suggest the most likely cause is anovulation, where the ovary does not consistently release an egg during the menstrual cycle. Pituitary adenoma and ovarian insufficiency would present with other symptoms, and polycystic ovary syndrome would typically present with irregular menstrual cycles, but also symptoms such as acne and hirsutism. A urine pregnancy test is negative, ruling out pregnancy as the cause."
