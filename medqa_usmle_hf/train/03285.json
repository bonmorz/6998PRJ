The symptoms of the patient include staring spells with frequent blinking and EEG findings of three-per-second spike and wave discharge, which are classic signs of absence seizures.

The symptoms, including the staring episodes for 30 to 60 seconds, blinking, and normal return to self afterwards along with EEG showing three-per-second spike and wave discharge, suggest the most likely diagnosis is absence seizure. Febrile seizure is seen in infants and young children with fever, while benign focal epilepsy is characterized by focal seizures that remain localized within a particular region of the brain. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy typically begins in adolescence and is characterized by myoclonic jerks."
