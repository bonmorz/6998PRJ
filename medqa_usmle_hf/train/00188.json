The symptoms described are consistent with complex partial seizures (previously known as temporal lobe epilepsy), which can include loss of awareness and repetitive movements such as facial grimacing and hand gestures. The muddy taste and confusion after the episode also suggest a temporal lobe origin. Absence seizures typically involve brief staring spells without any preceding aura or post-ictal confusion. Simple partial seizures can cause similar symptoms, but they do not involve loss of consciousness. Breath-holding spells usually occur in response to a stimulus such as pain or fear and do not involve altered consciousness or repetitive movements."

The symptoms suggest a complex partial seizure, as the patient experiences altered consciousness and recall of events, and possibly postictal confusion.
