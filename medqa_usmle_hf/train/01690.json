The patient's symptoms, including jaundice, splenomegaly, and abnormal red blood cell morphology, suggest a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. The eosin-5-maleimide binding test is the most sensitive test for confirming this condition. This test assesses the number of eosin-5-maleimide molecules that bind to the patient's red blood cells, which is decreased in patients with hereditary spherocytosis. The other tests listed may be helpful in diagnosing other conditions but are not as sensitive for hereditary spherocytosis."
