Normal calcium and phosphate levels and normal parathyroid hormone would suggest that this is not a primary bone disorder such as osteoporosis or hyperparathyroidism. Option A is incorrect because it suggests decreased calcium levels, which is not typical of bone metastases. Option B is incorrect because increased calcium levels would suggest hypercalcemia, which is not mentioned in the case. Option D is incorrect because the presence of bone lesions would cause an increase in alkaline phosphatase."

The patient presents with mild non-radiating low back pain, a blastic and sclerotic lesion on CT scan, and a history of prostatic adenocarcinoma, suggesting bone metastasis. Bone metastasis is often associated with increased alkaline phosphatase. Normal calcium and phosphate levels suggest that there is no significant bone loss. Normal parathyroid hormone levels indicate normal parathyroid function. Therefore, the most likely finding on a serum study in this patient is increased alkaline phosphatase."

The blastic and sclerotic lesion in the L5 vertebral body suggests metastatic disease, possibly from the patient's prostatic adenocarcinoma. Increased alkaline phosphatase is indicative of bone metastasis, which is supported by the CT findings. Normal calcium and phosphate levels rule out hyperparathyroidism, but the increased alkaline phosphatase suggests increased bone turnover. There is no indication of renal dysfunction or vitamin D deficiency, ruling out the first option. The second option would be indicative of hyperparathyroidism. Option D is not consistent with bone metastasis. Hence, option C is the correct answer."
