The patient presents with fever, pain in the left lower extremity, and limited range of motion in the left hip, along with elevated inflammatory markers and leukocytosis. X-rays show a widened acetabular space on the left side, which is suggestive of septic arthritis. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform synovial fluid drainage for diagnosis and treatment, along with cefazolin therapy. Vancomycin therapy is reserved for cases of suspected MRSA, which is not indicated in this case. Arthroscopic drainage of the hip may be necessary if initial treatment fails, but is not the immediate next step. Doxycycline therapy is not indicated in this case."
