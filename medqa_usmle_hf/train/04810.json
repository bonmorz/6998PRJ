The symmetrical distribution of the rash, lack of fever, itching, or trauma, and the intermittent stripes of normal skin on the palmar aspect of the hand suggest that this is likely a case of child abuse. As such, the most appropriate next step in management is to notify Child Protective Services. Forensic interviews and individual interviews may also be necessary, but the priority is to ensure the safety of the child. Biopsy is not the first step in this scenario."
