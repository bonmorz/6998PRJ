Gastrinoma secretes excess gastrin, leading to increased gastric acid secretion and duodenal ulceration. Secretin is secreted by the duodenal mucosa and stimulates pancreas and bile duct secretion. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is usually associated with VIPoma, a rare tumor that secretes VIP and causes chronic diarrhea. Motilin is produced by the intestinal mucosa and stimulates gastrointestinal motility."

Since the patient has a malignant islet cell tumor, which is a type of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, it is most likely to secrete gastrin, leading to the duodenal ulcer and frequent diarrhea. Secretin is secreted by S-cells in the duodenum and regulates pancreatic secretions. Vasoactive intestinal peptide and motilin are also hormones involved in digestion but are not likely to be elevated in this case."
