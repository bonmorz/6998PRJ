The patient\u2019s symptoms, especially the periorbital edema and proteinuria, suggest the presence of nephrotic syndrome. The high protein/creatinine ratio confirms this diagnosis. Prednisone therapy is the most appropriate next step in management. Enalapril and furosemide therapy may be used for hypertension, but they are not indicated for nephrotic syndrome. Anti-streptolysin O levels are used to diagnose a previous streptococcal infection, which is not the likely cause of nephrotic syndrome."
