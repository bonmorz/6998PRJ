The patient is presenting with symptoms of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO), which is an autosomal dominant disorder. Symptoms of AHO include short stature, rounded face, and shortening of the 4th and 5th fingers. The elevated parathyroid hormone also suggests pseudohypoparathyroidism, which is linked to AHO. X-linked recessive and mitochondrial inheritance are not relevant to this case. Autosomal recessive inheritance would require both parents to be carriers of the disease, which is not indicated in the question."

The patient has multiple symptoms including episodic spasm, poor performance in school, short fingers, round face, discolored teeth, and shorter height. The laboratory investigation reports show low calcium levels, elevated parathyroid hormone levels, and normal vitamin D levels. These findings suggest that the patient is suffering from pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A, which is an autosomal dominant inheritance. This means that the disease-causing gene is located on an autosome (non-sex chromosome) and one copy of an abnormal gene is sufficient to cause the disease."

The symptoms and physical examination findings suggest the patient has Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO), which is an autosomal dominant disorder. Short 4th and 5th fingers on both hands, round face, and discolored teeth are characteristic features of AHO. The laboratory findings also suggest hypocalcemia, which is another feature of AHO. X-linked recessive diseases are more common in males, but the patient is female. Mitochondrial inheritance occurs when the mother passes on the trait to her offspring. Autosomal recessive inheritance occurs when both parents are carriers of the gene and pass it on to their offspring."

The patient has physical features and laboratory findings consistent with a diagnosis of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO), which is a form of pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP). In PHP, there is resistance to the action of parathyroid hormone (PTH), resulting in hypocalcemia and elevated serum PTH levels. AHO is characterized by short stature, round face, subcutaneous ossifications, and shortening of the fourth and fifth metacarpals and metatarsals. AHO can be caused by a number of different genetic mutations, but the classic form is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Autosomal dominant."

The short 4th and 5th fingers, round face, and discolored teeth are all characteristic features of AHO. The high level of serum parathyroid hormone and low level of serum calcium point towards pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, which is a subtype of AHO inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.
