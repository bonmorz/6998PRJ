Identification refers to an individual taking on certain qualities or behaviors of another person they admire, in this case, the patient taking on the behavior of his father.

Reaction formation is when a person expresses the opposite of what they actually feel. Splitting is when a person is unable to view people or situations in shades of gray and instead categorizes them as all good or all bad.
