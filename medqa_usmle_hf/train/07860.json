It is worth noting that while lisinopril can cause skin rash as a side effect, it is unlikely to be related to the patient\u2019s psoriasis since the rash has been episodic since he was a teenager."

As the affected area is less than 3% of the total body surface area, topical treatment can be used as initial therapy. Topical clobetasol is a high-potency corticosteroid that can reduce inflammation and itching, while topical calcipotriol is a vitamin D analogue that can normalize skin cell growth. Methotrexate and cyclosporine are systemic immunosuppressants that carry more risks, while oral prednisolone is a systemic corticosteroid that should not be used long term due to side effects."
