We can then calculate the number of smokers who had a low birth weight: 1500 x 0.14 = 210. The excess risk of low birth weight in smokers compared to non-smokers is 210-108=102. The relative risk of low birth weight linked to cigarette smoking during pregnancy is 2%. We can use this information to calculate the attributable risk: 0.02 x 237 = 4.74. Therefore, the excess risk of low birth weight due to smoking is 4.74% out of 10% (the total risk difference between smokers and non-smokers), which equals 47.4%, or approximately 50%.

In this case, it is 108/1500 = 0.072 or 7.2%.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the incidence rate of low birth weight in non-smokers and smokers. The incidence rate of low birth weight in non-smokers is 7% and in smokers is 14%, as given in the question.\n\nThen, we calculate the relative risk, which is the risk of low birth weight in smokers divided by the risk in non-smokers: 14% / 7% = 2.\n\nTo calculate the attributable risk, we use the formula: attributable risk = incidence rate in exposed group - incidence rate in unexposed group. In this case, the exposed group is smokers and the unexposed group is non-smokers.\n\nThe incidence rate difference is: 14% - 7% = 7%. Therefore, the attributable risk of smoking for low birth weight is 7%.\n\nTo convert this to a percentage of the excess risk, we use the formula: (attributable risk / incidence in exposed group) x 100%. In this case, (0.07 / 0.14) x 100% = 50%. Therefore, 50% of the excess risk for low birth weight can be attributed to smoking. The answer is (D) 50%."
