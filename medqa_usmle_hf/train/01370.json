The patient\u2019s symptoms and the chest CT findings suggest drug-induced interstitial lung disease, which is a known side effect of some chemotherapy drugs.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease usually presents with an abnormal FEV1/FVC ratio, which is not the case here. Bacterial pneumonia may be possible due to the patient\u2019s immunocompromised state, but it would not explain the diffuse cystic airspaces seen on the chest CT."
