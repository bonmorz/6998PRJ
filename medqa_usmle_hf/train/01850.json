Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor that increases circulating levels of incretins by inhibiting their degradation. Incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), stimulate insulin secretion and inhibit glucagon release in a glucose-dependent manner, leading to improved blood glucose control in patients with type II diabetes mellitus. This is the direct mechanism of action of sitagliptin.

The mechanism of action for sitagliptin is that it inhibits degradation of endogenous incretins, which are hormones that increase insulin release and decrease glucagon secretion in response to meals. By inhibiting their degradation, sitagliptin stimulates insulin secretion and reduces glucose production by the liver, leading to better glycemic control.
