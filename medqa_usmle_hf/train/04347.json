Crypt ulcers can also be seen in inflammatory bowel disease, but they are characterized by the loss of the entire crypt, not just immune cell infiltration. Granulomas are another hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease but they are characterized by clusters of immune cells that form a structure resembling a nodule. Epithelial cell dysplasia is considered precancerous and would not be a finding in inflammatory bowel disease unless there has been a prolonged history of severe inflammation."
