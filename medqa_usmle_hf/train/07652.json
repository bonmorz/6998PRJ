The most appropriate initial test for this scenario is a D-dimer to rule out thromboembolic events, which would be elevated in the case of a pulmonary embolism. Chest radiograph could show a pleural effusion or other pulmonary pathology unrelated to pulmonary embolism. CT angiogram would be more specific for pulmonary embolism but involves more radiation exposure and should only be done after D-dimer testing is positive. Ultrasound of the lower extremities would be indicated if D-dimer is positive and there is concern for lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, but it is not the next appropriate test in this case."
