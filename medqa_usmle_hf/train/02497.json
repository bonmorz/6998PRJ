Clomiphene citrate is another option but is usually used if there are ovulatory problems. In vitro fertilization and human chorionic gonadotropin therapy are more invasive options that are usually considered if other treatments fail."

The follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels are normal, indicating anovulation is not the issue. The prolactin level is also normal, reducing the possibility of hyperprolactinemia. Considering the patient's exercise routine and stress, the most appropriate next step in management is offering pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy. This therapy can help increase follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone secretion, leading to follicular development and ovulation. Clomiphene citrate therapy can also be considered, but only as a second-line treatment after pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy fails. In vitro fertilization and human chorionic gonadotropin therapy are not appropriate at this stage of management."

However, she has dry vaginal mucosa, which can make it more difficult for sperm to reach the egg. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to offer pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy, which can help improve cervical mucus and increase the chances of conceiving. Clomiphene citrate therapy can stimulate ovulation, but is not appropriate in this case. In vitro fertilization and human chorionic gonadotropin therapy are also not necessary at this point, as there are no identified infertility issues."
