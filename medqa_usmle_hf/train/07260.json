The husband\u2019s reported history of frequent upper respiratory infections and the presence of nasal polyps in the wife suggest cystic fibrosis. The most common mutation associated with cystic fibrosis is the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 on the CFTR gene, which can lead to congenital absence of the vas deferens and obstructive azoospermia in men. Therefore, option (A) Deletion of Phe508 in husband is the most likely explanation for this couple\u2019s infertility."
