The patient's symptoms suggest hypercalcemia, and the nodule near the thyroid suggests the possibility of hyperparathyroidism. When parathyroid hormone is high, it promotes the release of calcium from the bones into the bloodstream, leading to bone pain. Increased calcium levels can also cause constipation. Therefore, the correct choice is (A): increased calcium, decreased phosphate, and increased parathyroid hormone. The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms."
