The patient has puncture wounds and is at risk for infection because of his comorbidities (peripheral vascular disease and hypertension) and habits (smoking and alcohol use). Clindamycin plus doxycycline are good choices for empiric broad-spectrum coverage, and irrigation and debridement are important for wound management. Azithromycin is not indicated for the management of puncture wounds, and doxycycline alone may not provide adequate coverage. Therefore, option (B) is the most appropriate management strategy for this patient."
