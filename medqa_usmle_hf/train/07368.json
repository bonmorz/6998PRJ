Since the patient's workup has shown no abnormalities, it is important to address her symptoms and provide supportive care. Option C, scheduling monthly follow-up appointments and assessing symptoms causing the most distress, is the most appropriate response in this situation. Option A is not necessary if there is no evidence of a cardiac issue. Option B and D both suggest potential psychological issues, but it is important to first focus on addressing the patient's symptoms before exploring other possibilities."

The extensive workup already ruled out any physical abnormalities, suggesting that the patient\u2019s symptoms are likely due to a psychological condition. Therefore, the most appropriate response is to assess and manage the patient\u2019s symptoms causing the most distress and schedule follow-up appointments. Answers A and D are inappropriate and potentially harmful, as they suggest invasive procedures and substance abuse, respectively. Answer B is also inappropriate as it may be perceived as dismissive of the patient\u2019s symptoms."
