The holosystolic, harsh murmur suggests a defect in the membranous interventricular septum, which is consistent with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Defects of the muscular interventricular septum are less common and usually result in a smaller VSD, while defects of endocardial cushion can cause a variety of cardiac anomalies including atrioventricular septal defects.

The holosystolic murmur heard at the 3- and 6-month check-ups is most likely due to a defect of the membranous interventricular septum, which is known as a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Defect of the muscular interventricular septum can also be a cause of VSD, but the question specifically asks for the most likely cause. Defective dynein functioning is not a known cause of cardiac murmurs, and failure of endocardial cushion to form is associated with atrioventricular septal defects rather than VSDs."
