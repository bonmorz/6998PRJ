According to Poiseuille's Law, blood flow is directly proportional to the fourth power of the vessel radius. A 50% reduction in vessel radius results in a reduction of flow by (0.5)^4 = 0.0625, or 93.75%. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) decreased by 93.75%. Changes in blood pressure, LAD length, and blood viscosity have no effect on this calculation."

Since blood viscosity and length of the LAD have not changed, the resistance (R) will remain constant. Therefore, the change in LAD flow will depend on the change in pressure difference (\u0394P). A 50% reduction in diameter of the LAD will increase the resistance by a factor of 16 (since resistance is inversely proportional to the radius to the fourth power). Therefore, the pressure difference will need to increase by a factor of 16 to maintain baseline blood flow. Since blood pressure has not changed, the pressure difference will be reduced by a factor of 16, resulting in a 93.75% decrease in LAD flow from baseline (option B)."

Given that her LAD artery diameter is only 50% of normal, her radius (r) is now 0.5 times the original radius. Squaring this value, we get 0.25. This means that her new LAD radius is 0.25 times the original radius. Therefore, her new cross-sectional area (A) is 0.25^2 or 0.0625 times the original area. Given that blood viscosity (\u03b7), blood pressure (\u0394P), and LAD length (l) have not changed, we can simplify the equation to Q \u221d r^4. Since her new LAD radius is 0.25 times the original radius, her new flow rate would decrease by 0.25^4 or 0.00390625. This is a 93.75% decrease in LAD flow from baseline (option B)."
