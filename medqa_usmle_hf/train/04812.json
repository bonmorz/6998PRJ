The patient's history of falls, decline in ability to care for himself, and the multiple comorbidities suggest that he may be experiencing vascular dementia. The presence of hypertension may be contributing to this condition. Alzheimer's dementia typically has a more gradual onset and Lewy body dementia is typically characterized by hallucinations, tremors, and movement difficulties. Normal aging alone would not explain the sudden change in behavior and decline in ability to care for himself."

Lewy body dementia can also present with confusion and falls, but the patient\u2019s medication history (fluoxetine) can worsen the condition with adverse drug reactions.
