The correct response is to reassure the patient that there is confidentiality in this situation but encourage her to tell her mother. It is important to establish trust with the patient and encourage open communication about drug use, while also emphasizing the potential dangers and consequences of continued use. However, healthcare professionals have legal and ethical responsibilities to report certain cases, such as suspected child abuse, but drug use alone may not fall under this category. Therefore, option (A) is not the best response. While informing the mother about drug use is important for the patient's health and well-being, it may also damage the trust established with the patient and discourage future open communication. Therefore, option (B) is not the best response. Agreement to the patient's request to withhold information from her mother may put the patient at risk and is therefore not the best response. Option (C) is incorrect."

Option (C) is not the best response as it disregards the safety and well-being of the patient. Option (D) is the best response as it respects the patient\u2019s request for confidentiality while also encouraging her to involve her mother, who can provide support and guidance for her to stop drug use. It is important to discuss the limits of confidentiality, such as situations involving harm to self or others, and offer referrals to resources for addiction treatment."

Option B is partially correct as drug use can pose a danger to health, but it may not be appropriate to immediately inform the mother without the patient's consent. Option C is not appropriate as the patient's health and safety should be prioritized, and illegal drug use is a serious concern."
