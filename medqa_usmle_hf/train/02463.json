Lowering insulin dosage on days of exercise is the most correct option because physical activity can lower blood sugar levels and keeping the usual insulin dosage can lead to hypoglycemia. Switching to metformin is not appropriate because the patient has type 1 diabetes which requires insulin therapy. Advising against physical activity is not appropriate because exercise can help maintain glucose control and improve overall health. Increasing insulin dosage on days of exercise is also not appropriate because it can increase the risk of hypoglycemia."
