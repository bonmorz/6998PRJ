The patient's recurrent symptoms are likely due to hypoglycemia, which can be caused by insulin use or other medications. Asking the patient if she is taking any other medications can help identify the cause. Insulin overdose may cause hypoglycemia, but there is no indication that the patient is intentionally or accidentally taking insulin. Glycated hemoglobin concentration and serum C-peptide concentration tests are not necessary to diagnose hypoglycemia."
