The patient's history of recent trauma and repetitive use of the wrist suggest a diagnosis of De Quervain's tenosynovitis, which is inflammation of the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist. The best next step in management would be rest and the use of ibuprofen for pain and inflammation. Radiography may be considered if there is suspicion of a bony injury, but in this case, there are no visible or palpable abnormalities. A thumb spica cast or wrist guard may be considered for more severe cases, but are not necessary in this scenario."
