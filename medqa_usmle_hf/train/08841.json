The symptoms seen in the patient suggest that he has arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), a disorder characterized by joint contractures and muscle weakness. The additional facial features suggest the presence of a syndrome, specifically autosomal recessive type of AMC (AMC-R). Among the options, only juvenile polycystic kidney disease has been associated with AMC-R. Maternal diabetes can cause a variety of fetal abnormalities including limb deformities and cardiac anomalies, but not the specific combination seen in this patient."
