Chronic infection of the palatine and lingual tonsils may cause tonsillitis, but would not explain the mass. Ductal obstruction of the sublingual salivary glands would not result in the symptoms described. Persistent epithelial tract between the foramen cecum and thyroid isthmus would not be in the location of the mass."
