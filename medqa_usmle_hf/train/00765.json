The patient's preoccupation with his stool and inability to stop thinking about it even after being reassured that it\u2019s normal suggest obsessive-compulsive symptoms. However, because the symptom is specifically related to his stool, Tourette syndrome, which is known for its motor and vocal tics, is the most likely disorder. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder may also be associated with this type of symptom, but it is not specific enough to be the best answer. Major depression and coprophilia are not associated with this type of symptom at all."
