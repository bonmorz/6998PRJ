Oral ivermectin could be used to treat scabies or other parasitic infections, but there is no indication for that in this case. Counseling on alcohol intake is not relevant to the current issue. Oral prednisone may be used in severe cases of poison ivy dermatitis, but it is not indicated for mild cases like this. Therefore, applying a topical calamine preparation would be the most appropriate next step in management."
