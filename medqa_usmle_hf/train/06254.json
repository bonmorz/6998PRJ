The patient is presenting with multiple symptoms suggestive of hypopituitarism, including fatigue, decreased libido and appetite, weight loss, decreased serum LH and FSH, and decreased serum GH. The brain MRI confirms the presence of a pituitary macroadenoma. Adrenal insufficiency can cause some similar symptoms, but the lab results show normal serum TSH and T4 and decreased serum cortisol, which is a hallmark of hypopituitarism. The visual field loss is also consistent with pituitary macroadenoma impinging on and displacing the optic chiasm. Hypothyroidism alone cannot explain all the symptoms, and there is no evidence of thyroid dysfunction. Functional pituitary macroadenomas are usually silent, whereas this patient has symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with hypopituitarism."
