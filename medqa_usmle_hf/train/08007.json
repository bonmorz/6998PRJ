The symptoms such as pain in feet, pale fingers and toes upon exposure to cold temperature, and an ulcer suggest Buerger's disease, which is also known as thromboangiitis obliterans. PAOD and atherosclerosis are also possible, but the absence of diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia reduces the likelihood of these diagnoses. Frostbite is not likely in this case because the symptoms are chronic in nature."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest Buerger\u2019s disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans, which is a rare disease that affects the blood vessels in the extremities, usually in young male smokers. Symptoms include pain in the feet during rest or exercise, pale fingers and toes during exposure to cold, and potentially ulcerations on the toes. PAOD and atherosclerosis are both related to the circulatory system, but the patient\u2019s normal blood sugar, blood pressure, and lipids make them less likely, especially in a young patient. Frostbite is also a possibility based on the cold exposure symptoms, but the smoking history and the presence of an ulcer make Buerger\u2019s disease a more likely diagnosis."

Peripheral arterial occlusive disease and atherosclerosis are also possibilities, but the patient\u2019s age and absence of other risk factors, as well as the presence of the ulcer, make Buerger\u2019s disease the most likely diagnosis.

Frostbite typically occurs in the extremities after exposure to extreme cold, and the patient\u2019s symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of a tiny ulcer suggests that Buerger\u2019s disease may have progressed to critical limb ischemia."
