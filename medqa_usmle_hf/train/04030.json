The patient has a history of DVT and recent surgery, which significantly increases the risk of developing pulmonary thromboembolism. Shortness of breath and chest pain are the common symptoms of pulmonary thromboembolism. The absence of fever and expectoration rules out pneumonia, and the absence of significant findings on physical exam and normal chest radiography argues against an exacerbation of chronic lung disease. While myocardial infarction can cause chest pain and tachycardia, the absence of ECG changes and normal vitals suggest that it is less likely than pulmonary thromboembolism."
