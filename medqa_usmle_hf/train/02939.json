The symptoms, especially the bipyramidal, envelope-shaped crystals in urine, suggest that the most likely cause is a kidney stone composed of uric acid. The patient's history of gout and recent use of a multivitamin supplement may have contributed to the formation of the stone. Vitamin C in large amounts can be metabolized to oxalate, which in turn can form calcium oxalate stones, but this is not the most likely cause in this patient. Vitamin B3 and E are not known to cause kidney stones."
