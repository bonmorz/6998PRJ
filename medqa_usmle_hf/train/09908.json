The presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear suggests that the patient has hemolytic anemia with fragmentation of erythrocytes. This can be caused by various conditions such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In the given case, the most likely cause is fragmentation hemolysis associated with aortic stenosis, based on the presence of a late systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border and the fact that the patient's brother has bicuspid aortic valve. There is no evidence to suggest gastrointestinal bleeding or erythrocyte enzyme defect. Autoimmune destruction of erythrocytes is a possible cause of hemolytic anemia, but is less likely in this case given the lack of other symptoms such as jaundice and a negative Coombs test."
