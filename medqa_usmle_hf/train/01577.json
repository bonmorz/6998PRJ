Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is a method of removing a portion of the cervix for further diagnosis or treatment of cervical dysplasia, which is appropriate in this case. Cryoablation may be used for low-grade lesions, while repeating cytology and HPV co-testing in 6 months may delay appropriate management if the patient's condition is worsening.
