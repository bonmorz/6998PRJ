Out of these, patients with poorly differentiated tumors had distant recurrence in 550 cases, patients with moderately differentiated tumors had distant recurrence in 375 cases, and patients with well-differentiated tumors had distant recurrence in 500 cases. Therefore, the total number of patients with distant recurrence is 1425 (550+375+500). The 15-year risk for distant recurrence in patients with high-grade breast cancer (i.e., poorly differentiated tumors) is calculated by dividing the number of patients with distant recurrence in this group by the total number of patients included in the study who were disease-free following adjuvant radiotherapy and had estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer i.e., 550/2500. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."
