The increased ALP levels and radiography showing cortical thickening are indicative of Paget's disease. Metastatic bone disease would typically show lesions rather than thickening of bone, and the patient's PSA levels were within normal limits, making prostate cancer less likely. Plasmacytoma is a type of cancer that affects plasma cells and is usually associated with elevated calcium levels, which were within normal limits in this patient. Primary hyperparathyroidism would show elevated calcium levels, which were not present in this case."
