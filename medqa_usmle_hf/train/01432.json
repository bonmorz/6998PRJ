The symptoms and lab findings suggest that the patient has glomerulonephritis, which commonly occurs as a result of a streptococcal infection. Therefore, a positive streptozyme test is a likely laboratory finding. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be elevated due to inflammation, and the C3 level may be decreased due to consumption. The ASO titer may or may not be elevated, as it is not always a reliable indicator of a recent streptococcal infection."

The presence of RBC and granular casts in the urine, as well as the smoky appearance of the urine, indicate glomerular injury. One of the diagnostic tests for post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is a positive streptozyme test. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate may or may not be elevated in this condition, so option A is incorrect. Increased C3 level and negative ASO titer are not typical findings in post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, so options C and D are also incorrect."
