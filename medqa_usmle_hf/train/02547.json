B cell clonal selection is the process by which B cells that have a receptor that can bind to a specific antigen are selected to proliferate and produce antibodies. After somatic hypermutation, a small amount of B cells will have an increased affinity for the antigen, leading to their selection and proliferation. The other options are incorrect: V(D)J recombination occurs before B cell activation; during antibody class switching, the constant region of the heavy chain changes, while the variable region stays the same; and somatic hypermutation can involve different types of mutations, not just deletions."

The question is asking about the process of B cell clonal selection and the formation of specific IgG antibodies against influenza virus antigens. Option A is incorrect because V(D)J recombination occurs during early B-cell development, not after activation. Option B is incorrect because during antibody class switching, the constant region of the heavy chain changes, not the variable region. Option C is incorrect because point mutations, not deletions, are the most common form of mutations that occur during somatic hypermutation. Option D is correct because only a small amount of B cells antigen receptors have increased affinity for the antigen after somatic hypermutation."

B cell clonal selection and the formation of specific IgG antibodies against influenza virus antigens involve several steps. After B lymphocyte activation, V(D)J recombination occurs before the B cell differentiates into a plasma cell. During antibody class switching, the variable region of antibody heavy chain stays the same, and the constant region changes. Somatic hypermutation introduces point mutations into the variable region of the antibody genes, and both substitutions and deletions can occur. Finally, B cells with increased affinity for the antigen are selected for survival and proliferation. Therefore, option (D) is correct."

During B cell clonal selection, the B lymphocytes with antigen receptors that have the highest affinity for the antigen proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells that produce specific IgG antibodies. Somatic hypermutation is a process that introduces point mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor genes to improve affinity for the antigen. Deletions are not a form of mutations that occur during somatic hypermutation. During antibody class switching, the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes, but the variable region stays the same. V(D)J recombination occurs in the bone marrow during B cell development to generate diverse B cell receptors, but it does not occur after B lymphocyte activation.
