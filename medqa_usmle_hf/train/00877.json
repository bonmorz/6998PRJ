The study attempted to analyze a group of patients over time, comparing their sociodemographics, health status, and hospital use before and after assessing their satisfaction with healthcare providers, which best fits the design of a prospective cohort study. Cross-sectional studies compare groups at a single point in time, while prospective case-control studies and retrospective case-control studies look at the relationship between exposure and outcome after the fact."

The use of a survey to assess patient satisfaction suggests a prospective cohort study design. Cross-sectional studies and retrospective case-control studies do not follow individuals over time, while prospective case-control studies specifically compare individuals with a certain outcome to those without, which is not the case in this study."

A prospective cohort study involves identifying a group of people and following them over time to see how their exposures (such as patient satisfaction) relate to specific outcomes (such as hospitalization). In this scenario, the study started by identifying a patient population and assessing their sociodemographics, health status, and hospital use. The same patient population was then followed up a year later to assess their satisfaction with healthcare providers and how it relates to hospitalization. Therefore, the best description of this study design is a prospective cohort study."
