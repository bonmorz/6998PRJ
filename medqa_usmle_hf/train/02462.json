Option (C) is the correct answer because if there is a large difference between the observed answers and the nonrespondent answers, this can lead to bias in the final publication. This is because the nonrespondents may have different characteristics or experiences than the respondents, which can affect the results. Prompting nonrespondents and broadening the pool of selected participants can help reduce bias, but these strategies may not fully address the issue of nonresponse bias. Options (A), (B), and (D) are not directly related to the potential for bias in the final publication."

Nonresponse bias occurs when there is a difference between respondents and nonrespondents that affects the outcome of the study. If the difference between the observed and nonrespondent answers is increased, this means that the nonrespondents are more different from the respondents, and the nonresponse bias is more pronounced. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. The other options do not directly address the issue of nonresponse bias."

In this case, the bias will be more pronounced if there is a significant difference between the responses of those who completed the survey and those who did not. Increasing the difference between the observed and nonrespondent answers would lead to a greater potential for bias. Option A, decreasing the proportion of nonrespondents, would actually decrease bias.

Option D, imputation techniques, may also address bias but it is not necessarily more pronounced than option C."

In this case, the researchers are trying to address the issue of nonresponse bias, where the nonrespondents may differ from the respondents in terms of the measured variables. By prompting nonrespondents and broadening the pool of selected participants, the researchers are trying to increase the response rate and reduce nonresponse bias. However, if the difference between the observed and nonrespondent answers is increased, it may create response bias, where the responses are systematically different from the true values in the target population. Therefore, increasing the difference between observed and nonrespondent answers can lead to a more pronounced bias in the final publication. Options A, B, and D are not directly related to this particular issue of bias."

Option (C) is correct because if there is a significant difference between the observed answers and the nonrespondent answers, it can introduce bias into the results. This is because the nonrespondents may have different characteristics or experiences than those who responded, and their nonresponse can skew the results. Prompting nonrespondents or broadening the pool of participants may help to reduce nonresponse bias, but if the difference between the two groups is too great, it can still introduce bias into the final publication. The other options, including decreasing the proportion of nonrespondents, using weighting-class adjustments, or employing imputation techniques, may also be useful strategies to reduce bias, but they are not directly related to the difference between observed and nonrespondent answers."
