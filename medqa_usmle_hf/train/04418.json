The symptoms and history suggest a bacterial lung infection with a cavity, which is most likely caused by anaerobic bacteria. Clindamycin is an appropriate antibiotic for anaerobic bacteria and thus the most appropriate next step in management. Bronchoscopy and drainage would only be necessary if there is evidence of abscess formation. Sputum cultures are useful for identifying the causative organism, but treatment should not be delayed while waiting for results. Metronidazole is also an option for anaerobic bacteria but may not be as effective as clindamycin."

The symptoms, history of alcoholism and smoking, and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a lung abscess. The most appropriate next step in management would be to initiate antibiotic therapy with coverage for anaerobic bacteria, which are the most common causative organisms of lung abscesses. Clindamycin is an appropriate choice for anaerobic coverage. Bronchoscopy may be considered later for evaluation and management of any underlying conditions or complications but is not the immediate next step. Sputum cultures would be helpful for identification of the causative organism, but the patient's condition is severe enough to require immediate initiation of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Metronidazole is also effective against anaerobic bacteria and could be considered as an alternative to clindamycin if the patient is unable to tolerate the latter."

Sputum cultures can be done to confirm the diagnosis and guide therapy, but it would not be the most appropriate first step in management.
