The other tests may be used later in the diagnostic process, but CT scan is necessary for an initial evaluation."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest malabsorption syndrome, and the big clue is the greasy stools which leave a residue in the toilet bowl, indicating the presence of undigested fat. The patient\u2019s history of alcohol consumption is also a possible contributing factor. The next step in diagnosis is therefore to order a CT abdomen with IV contrast to evaluate the pancreatic or hepatobiliary system. An EGD with biopsy of gastric mucosa can help diagnose Helicobacter pylori infection and gastritis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient with malabsorption symptoms. The d-xylose absorption test and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy are used for other conditions and are not necessary at this point in the diagnostic workup."
