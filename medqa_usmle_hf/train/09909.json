The patient\u2019s presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of ductal-dependent congenital heart disease (CHD), which can cause diminished pulmonary blood flow leading to hypoxia and congestive heart failure. The three sign is one of the classic radiological findings in infants with CHD (specifically coarctation of the aorta), showing a visible constriction in the aortic isthmus, with rib notching caused by dilated intercostal collateral vessels. The other options are not associated with CHD and therefore less likely findings on chest X-ray in this case."
