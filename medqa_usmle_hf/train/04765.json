The symptoms and the ultrasound findings at 20 weeks' gestation suggest that the patient had a velamentous cord insertion. The continuous watery discharge, positive fern and nitrite tests, and late decelerations all suggest premature rupture of membranes, which can occur more frequently in cases of velamentous cord insertion. Loss of the normal retroplacental hyperechogenic region can indicate placenta previa or abruption, which are not consistent with the patient's presentation. Retroplacental hematoma and subchorionic cyst are not likely to cause premature rupture of membranes."
