The patient's blood cultures grew S. gallolyticus, which is associated with bacterial endocarditis and gastrointestinal malignancy. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be a colonoscopy to screen for malignancy or colon polyps. Warfarin therapy is used for anticoagulation, which is not necessary in this case as there were no indications of thrombosis or embolism. An implantable defibrillator is not necessary for this patient as there was no indication of arrhythmia. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is not necessary as the patient's symptoms have resolved and the initial concern was bacterial endocarditis."
