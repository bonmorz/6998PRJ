The patient has undergone myocardial reperfusion, which means that blood flow has been restored to the affected area of the heart. Within 3 weeks, the patient is in the proliferative phase of healing, during which fibroblasts produce collagen to form scar tissue. Therefore, the expected gross finding in the myocardium would be white scar tissue. Coagulation necrosis and yellow necrotic area are associated with acute myocardial infarction, but the patient was treated for the same in the emergency department. Red granulation tissue is associated with the granulation phase of healing, which typically occurs after 7-10 days post-infarction."

The ST-segment elevation on the ECG is consistent with an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), which is caused by a lack of blood flow to the heart muscle. Over time, the area of dead heart muscle undergoes healing and repair, which involves the formation of scar tissue. Therefore, white scar tissue is the expected gross finding in the myocardium of this patient at this time. Coagulation necrosis and yellow necrotic areas are expected earlier in the course of the heart attack, while red granulation tissue is more indicative of a healing wound."
