The presence of testes and a normal level of LH and testosterone suggest that the child has male internal genitalia but ambiguous external genitalia. The most likely cause for this presentation is 5-alpha reductase deficiency, which affects the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and leads to incomplete masculinization of the external genitalia. Androgen receptor deficiency would result in female internal and external genitalia despite the presence of testes. The presence of two X chromosomes would result in female internal and external genitalia as well. Failed migration of neurons producing GnRH would result in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with incomplete sexual development."

The normal serum LH and testosterone levels suggest that the issue is not with the production of hormones, but with their conversion. 5-alpha reductase deficiency inhibits the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, leading to incomplete masculinization of the external genitalia. Androgen receptor deficiency can also lead to ambiguous genitalia, but in this case, there would be low levels of testosterone present. The failed migration of neurons producing GnRH and presence of two X chromosomes would not lead to the presence of testes."
