Therefore, the probability of all three children being normal (NN) is (0.75)^3 = 0.4219. The probability of having at least one child with CF is therefore 1 - 0.4219 = 0.5781.

The chance of passing on the CF allele to one child is 1/2. The chance of not passing on the CF allele is also 1/2. For each child, the probability of inheriting the CF allele is independent of the others. Therefore, the probability of having at least one child with CF out of three is equal to the probability of having 1, 2, or 3 children with CF. Using the binomial distribution formula, we get: \n\nP(1) = 3*(1/2)^1*(1/2)^2 = 3/8\nP(2) = 3*(1/2)^2*(1/2)^1 = 3/8\nP(3) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8\n\nThe probability of having at least one child with CF is the sum of these probabilities: \n\nP(at least one) = P(1) + P(2) + P(3) = 37/64. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D)."

The probability that at least one of their next three children will have CF can be calculated as the complement of the probability that none of their next three children will have CF, which is (3/4)^3 or 27/64.

Both parents are carriers of a single mutation, which means they have one normal allele and one mutated allele. The chance of each parent passing on the mutated allele is 1/2. Therefore, the probability of their child inheriting two mutated alleles (having CF) is (1/2) x (1/2) = 1/4. The probability of their child inheriting one normal and one mutated allele (being a carrier like the parents) is (1/2) x (1/2) = 1/4. Using the same method, we can create a Punnett square for each of the three potential children. The probability of each child having CF is 1/4, and the probability of each child being a carrier is 1/4. To calculate the probability that at least one of the next three children will have CF, we can calculate the probability that none of them will have CF and subtract that from 1. The probability that all three children will be carriers is (1/4) x (1/4) x (1/4) = 1/64. The probability that none of the children will have CF is (3/4) x (3/4) x (3/4) = 27/64.

The probability of both parents being carriers is 2/4, and the probability of passing on the mutated gene to each offspring is 1/4. Using a Punnett square, we can calculate the probability of each child having CF as 1/16. To calculate the probability of at least one out of three children having CF, we can use the complement rule and calculate the probability of none of the children having CF and subtract it from 1. The probability of none of the children having CF is (15/16)^3, which is approximately 0.857. Subtracting this from 1 gives us a probability of 0.143, which is equivalent to 37/64. Therefore, the answer is (D) 37/64."
