Among the options given, losing 15 kg of body weight is the most likely to result in the greatest reduction of systolic blood pressure. Obesity is a known risk factor for hypertension and weight loss has been shown to significantly reduce blood pressure. Decreasing alcohol consumption and adopting a DASH diet can also help improve blood pressure, but may not result in as significant of a reduction as weight loss. Walking for 30 minutes, 5 days per week is recommended for overall health and cardiovascular fitness, but may not have as significant of an impact on blood pressure as the other options."

The patient\u2019s blood pressure indicates Stage 1 hypertension and lifestyle changes are recommended before pharmacologic therapy.

Decreasing alcohol consumption, adopting a DASH diet, and regular exercise can also help reduce blood pressure, but weight loss has the greatest impact. Therefore, choice (A) is the correct answer."
