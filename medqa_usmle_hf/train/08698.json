The left atrium can accommodate a larger than normal stroke volume to compensate for the regurgitation, and increased compliance can prevent the development of symptoms of pulmonary hypertension or edema. The right ventricle is not directly involved in mitral regurgitation so it is less likely to be compensating. The aorta is not directly involved and it is unlikely to compensate for mitral regurgitation. A ballooning of the valve would not cause a holosystolic murmur."
