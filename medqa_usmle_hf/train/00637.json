The ultrasound image shows cholelithiasis, which also supports the diagnosis. Since the common bile duct is not dilated, there is no indication for a CBD stone removal procedure, making options A and D incorrect. Percutaneous cholecystostomy is a temporizing measure for critically ill patients who are not suitable for surgery or endoscopic procedures, and since the patient is stable, this procedure is not necessary. The most appropriate treatment for acute cholecystitis with cholelithiasis is laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
