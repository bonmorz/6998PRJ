The ABG and biochemistry results indicate metabolic acidosis with an increased bicarbonate level and a normal potassium level. This is consistent with respiratory compensation for opioid-induced respiratory depression, leading to an increase in bicarbonate levels and a decrease in CO2 levels, which is reflected in the ABG as a decreased pH and increased bicarbonate level. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."

Respiratory depression causes an increase in carbon dioxide levels, leading to acidosis, so we would expect to see a decreased pH and increased Pco2.
