Complications of Mycoplasma pneumonia include hemolytic anemia, which is caused by cold agglutinins. In this case, the positive Coombs test supports the diagnosis of hemolytic anemia. Cold agglutinins cause red blood cells to bind to IgM antibodies in low temperatures, leading to complement activation and hemolysis. Option A is incorrect as red blood cell binding to IgG occurs in warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Option B is incorrect as Mycoplasma pneumonia is not associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Option D is incorrect as the underlying mechanism of hemolysis in Mycoplasma pneumonia is complement-dependent."
