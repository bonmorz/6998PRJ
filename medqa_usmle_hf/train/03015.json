Eisenmenger syndrome is a complication of untreated large VSDs that result in Eisenmenger reaction where there is increased pulmonary vascular resistance leading to right-to-left shunting of blood. This causes right ventricular hypertrophy and dilation, leading to a right ventricular heave. Therefore, the correct answer is (B). The other options are signs of different cardiac conditions. A mid-diastolic low-pitched rumble at the apex is a sign of mitral stenosis, prominence of the left precordium suggests enlargement of the left ventricle or aortic aneurysm, and lateral displacement of the apical impulse is seen in left ventricular hypertrophy, as may occur in aortic stenosis."
