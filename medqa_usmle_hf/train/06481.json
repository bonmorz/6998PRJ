Barking cough and use of accessory muscles for breathing suggest croup, which is commonly caused by parainfluenza virus. Chest radiograph showing narrowing of upper trachea and subglottis is a characteristic finding of croup. Inflammation and swelling of the parotid glands and testes suggest mumps, photophobia, hypersalivation, and dysphagia suggest rabies, and postauricular lymphadenopathy and rash starting on the face suggest rubella, but none of these are related to the given diagnosis of an upper respiratory infection caused by a parainfluenza virus."

The barking cough and use of accessory muscles for breathing are characteristic symptoms of croup, which is commonly caused by parainfluenza virus. Chest radiograph showing narrowing of upper trachea and subglottis is a hallmark finding in croup. Therefore, choice (A) is the correct answer. Choices (B), (C), and (D) are not characteristic of upper respiratory infection caused by parainfluenza virus. Swelling of parotid glands and testes is seen in mumps. Photophobia, hypersalivation, and dysphagia are suggestive of rabies. Postauricular lymphadenopathy and rash starting on the face is seen in measles."
