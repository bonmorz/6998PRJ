The minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) is the concentration of an inhaled anesthetic that prevents movement in 50% of patients in response to a surgical stimulus. Nitrous oxide has a very high MAC compared to other anesthetics, meaning it has decreased lipid solubility and decreased potency. Option (B) is incorrect because increased lipid solubility would actually increase potency, not decrease it. Option (C) is also incorrect because decreased lipid solubility would not increase potency. Option (D) is incorrect because increased lipid solubility would increase potency, not decrease it."

Minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) refers to the concentration of an inhaled anesthetic agent required to prevent movement in 50% of subjects in response to a surgical stimulus. Nitrous oxide has a high MAC compared to other anesthetics, which means it has a decreased potency (less effective for anesthesia) and decreased lipid solubility (does not dissolve well in fatty tissues). Therefore, the correct answer is (A)."
