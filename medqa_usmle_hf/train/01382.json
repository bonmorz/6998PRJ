A decrease in platelet count during anticoagulation therapy can suggest heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which can occur in up to 5% of patients. Discontinuing both heparin and warfarin is the recommended approach in this scenario, as well as initiating a non-heparin anticoagulant such as argatroban or fondaparinux. Administering vitamin K is not appropriate as it will only correct the INR, which is not the main concern in this situation. Continuing heparin and warfarin may exacerbate HIT and potentially lead to serious complications."
