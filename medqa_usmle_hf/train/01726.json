The patient has multiple medical problems, including hypertension, and communication with the patient is key to understanding the best course of treatment. Option B allows for open-ended communication to determine the underlying cause of the elevated blood pressure and develop a plan to manage it. Option A is accusatory in nature and may not address any potential issues with medication adherence. Option C assumes non-adherence without allowing for discussion or exploration of other potential causes. Option D is a closed-ended question that does not allow for open communication or exploration of underlying causes."
