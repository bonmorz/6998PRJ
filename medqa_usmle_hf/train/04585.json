Option (A) is not appropriate, as the patient is an adult and not a minor. Option (B) is not ideal, as it does not address the patient's need for medical care. Option (D) is not appropriate, as the patient's dean does not need to be informed unless it is related to the patient's academic performance."

Option (A) is not applicable since the patient is of legal age and can make his own medical decisions. Option (B) is not the best response since the patient\u2019s safety may be compromised if he leaves without proper medical care. Option (D) is not appropriate as it does not address the immediate safety concerns of the patient."
