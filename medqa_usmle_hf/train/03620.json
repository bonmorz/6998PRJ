The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS), which is characterized by persistent pain in the pelvic region for longer than 3 months, and includes pain in the perineum, scrotum, and pain during ejaculation and urination. This diagnosis is supported by the laboratory findings which show no abnormalities except for a mildly tender prostate on rectal examination. Prostatic abscess and bladder neck cancer present with more severe symptoms such as fever and weight loss, and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia typically presents with urinary hesitancy and frequency."
