The symptoms experienced by the patient, including nausea, vomiting, and decreased frequency of urination, suggest the possibility of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). The increased leukocyte count and recent chemotherapy make the diagnosis of TLS more likely. The combination of hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, lactic acidosis, and urate crystals in the urine are supportive of the diagnosis of TLS. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

The symptoms, physical examination findings, and history of recent chemotherapy suggest that the patient has tumor lysis syndrome, which leads to rapid destruction of cancer cells and release of intracellular components into the bloodstream. This can cause metabolic abnormalities such as hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and lactic acidosis. Urate crystals in the urine are also a characteristic finding in tumor lysis syndrome. Option A is incorrect because extremely elevated creatine kinase (MM) is not characteristic of tumor lysis syndrome. Option C is incorrect because urinary monoclonal spike is not associated with tumor lysis syndrome. Option D is incorrect because oxalate crystals are not characteristic of tumor lysis syndrome."
