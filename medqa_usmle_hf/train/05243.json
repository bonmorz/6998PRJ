Intravenous corticosteroids are also recommended for moderate to severe exacerbations, but they take longer to work than inhaled bronchodilators. Ipratropium bromide is a second-line therapy that can be used in addition to albuterol. Theophylline is not recommended for acute exacerbations of asthma."

The patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation of asthma, so the most appropriate next step would be to administer inhaled albuterol, a short-acting beta agonist. Intravenous corticosteroids can also be given to reduce inflammation, but inhaled albuterol should be given first. Ipratropium bromide can also be used as an adjunct to bronchodilators, but inhaled albuterol is the initial treatment of choice. Theophylline is a possible treatment option, but it has a narrow therapeutic window and can have significant side effects, so it is not usually the first choice."

Inhaled albuterol is the most appropriate next step as it is a short-acting beta-agonist that helps to relieve bronchospasm and improve breathing in acute asthma exacerbations. Intravenous corticosteroid may be warranted, but the immediate priority is to relieve the patient's symptoms. Inhaled ipratropium bromide may also be used, but its effects are slower and less potent than albuterol. Inhaled theophylline is not recommended in acute asthma exacerbations due to its side effects and slower onset of action."
