The high-riding prostate is a classic sign of posterior urethral injury. The fractures of the pubic rami suggest a pelvic fracture which can cause an injury to the urethra. Blood at the urethral meatus suggests a urethral injury. Rupture of the corpus cavernosum would present with acute penile swelling and pain, while tearing of the anterior urethra would present with a urethral injury but not the high-riding prostate. Tearing of the ureter would not cause the symptoms described."

The patient\u2019s symptoms and physical examination results suggest that the most likely cause is a tearing of the posterior urethra. The presence of blood at the urethral meatus, high-riding prostate, and fractures of all four pubic rami are suggestive of posterior urethral injury. Rupture of the corpus cavernosum would cause penile swelling and deformity, not urinary retention. Tearing of the anterior urethra is less likely due to the absence of urethral bleeding without palpable urethral defect. Tearing of the ureter would not cause urinary retention."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a possible urethral injury, and the presence of blood at the urethral meatus confirms that. The high-riding prostate is also indicative of a posterior urethral injury. Fractures of pubic rami suggest pelvic fracture, which is a common cause of urethral injury. Choosing option (A) of tearing of the anterior urethra is incorrect because the patient has a high-riding prostate, which is more indicative of a posterior urethral injury. Option (B) of rupture of the corpus cavernosum is also incorrect since there is no mention of penile swelling and pain, which are the typical symptoms of this injury. Option (D) of tearing of the ureter is unrelated to the patient\u2019s symptoms."
