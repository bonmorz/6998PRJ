The clear rush of fluid from the vagina suggests rupture of membranes, while the abdominal pain and contractions suggest preterm labor. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, is used to accelerate fetal lung maturation and decrease the risk of respiratory distress syndrome when preterm delivery is expected within the next 7 days. Terbutaline may be used to delay preterm labor, but is not the best first step in this case. RhoGAM is used in cases of Rh incompatibility, which is not indicated in this patient. Expectant management can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in both the mother and fetus."
