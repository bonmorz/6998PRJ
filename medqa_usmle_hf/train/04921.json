The results of the complete blood count and electrophoresis show that she has thalassemia trait and her husband does not. The fetus is showing signs of hydrops fetalis, indicating severe anemia. Cordocentesis can be performed for both diagnostic (to assess the fetus\u2019 blood type and hemoglobin concentration) and therapeutic (to perform intrauterine blood transfusion) purposes in this case. Fetoscopy and amniocentesis do not provide information about the fetal blood type or allow for intrauterine blood transfusion. Fetal thoracentesis is not appropriate for this case as it only addresses the pleural effusion and not the underlying cause of the hydrops fetalis."

It can be used to obtain a sample of fetal blood for genetic testing and to perform intrauterine blood transfusion to help manage fetal anemia in cases of alpha-thalassemia major. None of the other options are appropriate for this case. Fetoscopy is an invasive prenatal diagnostic procedure that allows visualization of the fetus and sampling of fetal tissue, but it is not useful for managing fetal anemia. Amniocentesis is used to obtain amniotic fluid for genetic testing and can also be used to assess fetal lung maturity, but it is not useful for managing fetal anemia or ascites. Percutaneous fetal thoracentesis is a therapeutic procedure that can be used to drain pleural fluid in cases of fetal hydrops, but it is not useful for managing fetal anemia or ascites."
