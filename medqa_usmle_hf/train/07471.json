These disorders are associated with metabolic alkalosis, which leads to an increased bicarbonate level and a decreased chloride level. Potassium levels may also decrease due to vomiting or laxative abuse. Therefore, the correct option is (B) Decreased chloride, decreased potassium, increased bicarbonate."
