The elevated alkaline phosphatase and antimitochondrial antibody titer suggest primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) which involves intrahepatic bile duct destruction. Therefore, we expect to see intrahepatic bile duct destruction on liver biopsy. Option A, B, and D are more likely to occur in other liver diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) or autoimmune hepatitis. Granulomas in portal tracts are more likely to be seen in sarcoidosis or tuberculosis."

Elevated alkaline phosphatase, normal to mildly elevated aminotransferase, and positive antimitochondrial antibody titer support the diagnosis of PBC. On liver biopsy, one would see intrahepatic bile duct destruction, which is a hallmark of PBC. Intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct destruction is seen in primary sclerosing cholangitis.
