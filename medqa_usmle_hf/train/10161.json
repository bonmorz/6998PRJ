In this scenario, substance Y is being actively secreted by the renal tubules, leading to a renal clearance that is greater than the amount filtered. Para-amino hippuric acid (PAH) is the most similar substance to this scenario because it is also actively secreted by the renal tubules, and therefore has a higher clearance than the amount filtered. Magnesium, bicarbonate, and glucose are not actively secreted by the renal tubules and therefore would not exhibit this pattern of clearance."

Renal clearance is the volume of plasma from which a substance is completely removed in a given time period by urinary excretion. If the amount of substance Y excreted is greater than the amount filtered, it suggests that substance Y is actively secreted into the urine. Only para-amino hippuric acid (PAH) is actively secreted into the urine in addition to being filtered by glomeruli. Magnesium, bicarbonate, and glucose are filtered but are not actively secreted. Therefore, the correct answer is (C)."
