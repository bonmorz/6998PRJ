Tabes dorsalis, caused by syphilis, presents with ataxia and sensory loss; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis affects upper and lower motor neurons and has a more rapid progression of symptoms; cervical disk prolapse usually causes unilateral symptoms."

The absence of sensory deficits points towards Syringomyelia, a rare disorder characterized by the presence of a fluid-filled cavity or syrinx within the spinal cord that can damage motor neurons. Tabes dorsalis and Amytrophic lateral sclerosis present with spastic tone and hyperreflexia, which are not observed in this case. Cervical disk prolapse may cause radiculopathy or nerve root entrapment, but is unlikely to cause the bilateral symptoms observed in this patient."

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that she has syringomyelia, which is a rare disorder that affects the spinal cord. The motor, sensory, and reflex deficits are classic symptoms of this condition, which occurs when a fluid-filled cyst, or syrinx, forms in the center of the spinal cord. The history of a motor vehicle collision raises suspicion for this diagnosis, as trauma is a common cause of syringomyelia. Tabes dorsalis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and cervical disk prolapse can present with some similar symptoms, but are less likely given the specific findings in this case."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis typically begins with symptoms in one limb and progresses asymmetrically. Cervical disk prolapse may cause similar symptoms, but absent reflexes and muscle weakness bilaterally suggest a spinal cord lesion rather than a peripheral nerve problem."
