Anti-CMV IgM would be positive in a patient with an active cytomegalovirus infection, but this is not the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms. A throat swab culture may identify other bacteria that could be causing the patient\u2019s symptoms, but it would not be the most sensitive or specific test for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis."
