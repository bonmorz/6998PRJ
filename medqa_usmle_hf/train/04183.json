The image provided shows a \"bull neck\" appearance, which is highly suggestive of a diphtheria infection caused by the toxin-producing bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The bacteria can be cultured on Tellurite Agar, which allows colonies to produce brownish-black halos due to tellurite reduction. Bordet-Genou Agar is used to culture Bordetella pertussis, the bacteria that causes whooping cough. Eaton's Agar is used to culture Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Thayer-Martin Agar is used to culture Neisseria gonorrhoeae."
