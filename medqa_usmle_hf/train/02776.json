The physical features, such as a small head, wide-spaced eyes, short palpebral fissures, sunken nasal bridge, and small jaw, are common in individuals with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. The developmental delays, difficulty following directions, and behavioral problems are also consistent with this diagnosis. Nondisjunction of chromosome 21 causes Down Syndrome, deletion of long arm of chromosome 7 causes Williams Syndrome, and FMR1 gene mutation causes Fragile X Syndrome, which all have different clinical presentations that do not match the patient's symptoms. The pansystolic murmur needs further evaluation, but it is not likely to be related to this diagnosis."

The small head, wide-spaced eyes, short palpebral fissures, sunken nasal bridge, and small jaw are characteristic of fetal alcohol syndrome, which can result from prenatal alcohol exposure. The inability to concentrate, difficulties completing assignments, and hyperactivity can also be symptoms of this syndrome. The fact that there is a murmur present does not provide enough information to suggest a specific cause. Chromosomal abnormalities (options A and B) can also result in developmental delays and intellectual disabilities, but the physical features are not consistent with these conditions, and there is no family history of serious illness. A mutation in the FMR1 gene (option D) is associated with fragile X syndrome, which can cause similar developmental delays and intellectual disabilities, but this syndrome is often accompanied by physical features such as large ears, jaw, and testicles, which are not present in this patient."

The symptoms described are consistent with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, which can result from prenatal alcohol exposure.
