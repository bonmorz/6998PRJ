The patient is experiencing a persistent, dry cough as a side effect of taking lisinopril, which is an ACE inhibitor that can cause coughing due to an increase in bradykinin levels. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect. Loratadine is an antihistamine and would not be effective in treating a cough caused by an ACE inhibitor. Beta agonists are used to treat asthma, which the patient has a history of, but they are not indicated for a cough caused by an ACE inhibitor. Non-caseating granulomas are often found on biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with sarcoidosis, which is a condition that can cause a persistent cough, among other symptoms. However, the painful bumps on the patient's lower extremities (known as erythema nodosum) are a more specific finding in sarcoidosis and suggest that this may be the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Therefore, option (D) is the most likely true for this patient's chief concern."

The patient's chief complaint is a persistent, dry cough, which is a known side effect of ACE inhibitors like lisinopril. This is due to the accumulation of bradykinin, a vasoactive peptide, and other substances leading to increased vasodilation and edema in the airways. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Serum levels of bradykinin will be elevated. Loratadine is an antihistamine used for allergies, and beta-agonists are used for asthma. The presence of painful bumps on the patient's lower extremities raises suspicion for erythema nodosum, which can be associated with inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, and infections. Non-caseating granulomas are found on biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes in sarcoidosis. However, in this case, a biopsy has not been performed and no other symptoms suggestive of sarcoidosis have been mentioned, so this option is not the correct answer."

ACE inhibitors inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin, which can cause coughing. Therefore, (A) is a possible answer. However, the patient's other symptoms, such as the painful bumps on her legs, fatigue, joint pain, and burning sensation in her sternum suggest a possible diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Non-caseating granulomas are a hallmark of sarcoidosis and are commonly found on biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes. Therefore, (D) is the most likely answer. Loratadine is an antihistamine used to treat allergies, so (B) is unlikely. Beta agonists are used to treat asthma, which the patient does have a history of, but they are unlikely to relieve her cough in this case."

The patient is experiencing a persistent, dry cough after being started on lisinopril, which is an ACE inhibitor that can cause coughing as a side effect due to increased levels of bradykinin. Therefore, option (A) is a possible answer, but it is not the most likely one. Option (B) suggests using loratadine, which is an antihistamine used to treat allergies, but it is not likely to help with the patient's persistent cough. Option (C) suggests using beta agonists, which are commonly used to treat asthma, but may not be helpful in this case as the patient's asthma is not the chief complaint. Option (D) is the most likely answer as the patient has painful bumps on her lower extremities, which suggest erythema nodosum, a form of panniculitis commonly associated with sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis can also cause a persistent cough, and non-caseating granulomas are a hallmark finding on biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes."

The patient has recently started taking lisinopril, which is an ACE inhibitor, and is presenting with a persistent dry cough. This suggests that the patient may be experiencing ACE inhibitor-induced cough, which occurs due to increased levels of bradykinin. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer. Loratadine is an antihistamine and would be more effective in treating seasonal allergies, not a persistent dry cough. Beta agonists are used to treat asthma symptoms but would not relieve the patient's cough. Non-caseating granulomas are found in sarcoidosis, but the patient's presentation and physical examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis. The painful bumps on the patient's lower extremities are likely due to erythema nodosum, which can be associated with underlying diseases such as sarcoidosis, but further investigation is needed to confirm this diagnosis."

The patient's persistent dry cough is a possible side effect of lisinopril, which inhibits the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) that breaks down bradykinin.

The painful bumps on her lower extremities suggest erythema nodosum, which is commonly associated with conditions such as sarcoidosis or infections like strep throat or tuberculosis, which can cause granulomas to form in the mediastinal lymph nodes. Thus, a biopsy of the mediastinal lymph nodes may reveal non-caseating granulomas. However, this is not directly related to the patient's chief concern of persistent dry cough."
