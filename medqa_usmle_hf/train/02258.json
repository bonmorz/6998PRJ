The patient presents with a gunshot wound to the abdomen and signs of hypovolemia, such as low blood pressure, pale and cool extremities, and diminished cardiac sounds. Aspiration of the nasogastric tube reveals bloody contents, indicating internal bleeding. The abdominal examination shows distension, diffuse tenderness, and rebound, further supporting the suspicion of intra-abdominal bleeding. The next best step in management is exploratory laparotomy, which can both diagnose and treat the intra-abdominal bleeding. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) is a useful tool for rapid evaluation of trauma patients, but for this patient with unstable vital signs and signs of intra-abdominal bleeding, exploratory laparotomy is preferred. Abdominal X-ray and diagnostic peritoneal lavage are not as reliable as CT scan for diagnosing intra-abdominal bleeding and are not the preferred next step in management for this patient."
