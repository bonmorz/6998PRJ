Colloid-containing fluids, factor concentrate, and fresh frozen plasma may help with some symptoms but are not curative for chronic liver disease."

The patient's history of multiple hospital admissions with acute pancreatitis, dehydration and suicide attempts indicates that he has a chronic liver disease, which is further supported by his low albumin level, prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated BUN and creatinine. The empty pill bottles suggest he may have taken an overdose of medications, potentially exacerbating his liver disease. The most effective therapy for this patient's underlying pathology is a liver transplant. Colloid-containing fluids or factor concentrates would not address the underlying liver disease, and fresh frozen plasma may provide temporary support but would not address the root cause."
