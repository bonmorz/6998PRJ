The patient has sustained a gunshot wound to the abdomen and has no signs of hemodynamic instability or peritonitis on physical examination. The most appropriate next step in management would be a CT scan of the abdomen to assess for any potential injuries and help guide further management. Close observation may be appropriate in certain cases, but with a gunshot wound, a CT scan is more useful in identifying any injuries that may be missed on physical examination. Diagnostic laparoscopy or immediate laparotomy would be indicated in patients with hemodynamic instability or signs of peritonitis."
