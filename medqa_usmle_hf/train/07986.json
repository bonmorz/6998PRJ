The orange sand-like crystals in the urine suggest that the patient has either Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or Fabry disease, both of which are X-linked recessive disorders. The medication prescribed inhibits the production of the crystals, which are made of uric acid, so the enzyme targeted by the medication is Xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for the conversion of purines to uric acid. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) is an enzyme involved in the salvage pathway of purine synthesis and is deficient in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of purines and is deficient in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Aminolevulinic acid synthetase (ALAS) is the first enzyme in the pathway of heme synthesis and deficiencies can cause porphyrias."

The presence of orange sand\u2013like crystalline material in the child\u2019s diaper suggests the presence of uric acid crystals, which can be caused by Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, an X-linked recessive disorder. Allopurinol, a medication that inhibits xanthine oxidase, is used to treat this disorder and prevent the production of uric acid. Hence, option (B) is correct. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency is also an X-linked recessive disorder that leads to the production of uric acid, causing gout and kidney stones. Adenosine deaminase deficiency leads to severe combined immunodeficiency disease, and aminolevulinic acid synthetase deficiency results in porphyria."
