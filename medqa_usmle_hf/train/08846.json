Option (B) is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because it calculates the maternal death rate as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total number of women of childbearing age, without considering the number of live births. Option (C) is incorrect. Option (D) calculates the maternal death rate as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total number of deaths of women of childbearing age, which is not the correct calculation."

To convert this to maternal mortality rate, we need to include deaths of women of childbearing age not included in the maternal deaths. So, we add the number of deaths of women of childbearing age to the numerator and calculate again: ((2500 + 7500) / 250,000) x 1000 = 10 per 1000 women. Therefore, the answer is (B), 10 per 1,000 women."

Therefore, the correct answer is (B), which is 10 per 1,000 women (since there are 10 women of childbearing age for every live birth).
