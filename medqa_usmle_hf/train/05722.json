Absence of menstruation, delayed puberty, and poor sports performance are common symptoms in Turner syndrome. Bounding brachial pulses and diminished femoral pulses are signs of coarctation of the aorta, which is associated with Turner syndrome. Short neck, excess skin in the lateral neck, and atrophic legs are also common features of Turner syndrome. Marfan syndrome is associated with tall stature, long fingers, and cardiac abnormalities. Friedreich ataxia is a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and affects coordination and balance. Kartagener's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that causes problems with the structure of cilia and affects organ function."
