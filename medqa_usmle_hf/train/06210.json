The patient\u2019s symptoms, including abdominal pain, loose stools, and fever, suggest inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The CT scan revealed focal inflammation in the terminal ileum and transverse colon. Non-caseating granulomas are a histologic finding specific for Crohn\u2019s disease, one type of IBD. Neutrophilic inflammation of the crypts is a common finding in ulcerative colitis, another type of IBD. Intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies are seen in viral infections, but this patient\u2019s stool tests for infection were negative."
