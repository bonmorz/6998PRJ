The mixed venous oxygen saturation of 55% indicates decreased hemoglobin concentration, as the blood returning to the heart has not been fully oxygenated by the lungs. This can lead to breathlessness due to inadequate oxygenation of the body. Increased carbon dioxide retention or peripheral shunting would not lead to a low mixed venous oxygen saturation. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance is another possibility, but it is less likely as the patient's oxygen saturation is still high."
