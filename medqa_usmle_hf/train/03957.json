Acute kidney injury and Mycobacteria tuberculosis do not explain the patient's presentation and laboratory values. Withdrawal from prednisone use may cause adrenal insufficiency, but the patient's symptoms began after the prednisone taper was completed, making this less likely as the most likely diagnosis."
