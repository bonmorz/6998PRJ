The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest the possibility of a congenital heart defect such as an atrial or ventricular septal defect. A positive bubble study would be the most likely to detect this, as it involves injecting saline with microbubbles into a vein and monitoring its presence in the heart using echocardiography. Aortic stenosis and mitral insufficiency are unlikely given the absence of a murmur on examination. Ventricular aneurysm may cause symptoms such as chest pain, but it is not likely to be the cause of the patient\u2019s syncope and cyanosis."
