The patient likely suffered from opioid overdose, as evidenced by the constricted, non-reactive pupils and decreased respiratory rate. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can be given to reverse the effects of opioids and improve breathing. Ethanol is not a treatment for opioid overdose, although it can be given to treat alcohol poisoning. Methadone is an opioid agonist used for opioid dependence treatment. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist used to treat bradycardia and other cholinergic symptoms, but is not used for opioid overdose."

The symptoms described are consistent with opioid overdose, and the drug given to help alleviate the symptoms is Naloxone, which is a opioid antagonist that can quickly reverse the effects of overdose. Option A is incorrect because ethanol would exacerbate the symptoms by causing more depression of the central nervous system. Option B is incorrect because methadone is not used for acute opioid overdose. Option D is incorrect because atropine is used for muscarinic receptor-mediated symptoms such as bradycardia, excessive salivation, and bronchoconstriction, which are not present in this case."
