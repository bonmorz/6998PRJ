The anuria and increased fluid in the abdomen suggest a low urinary osmolality. The increased respiratory rate and decreased blood pressure suggest respiratory and circulatory distress, which would increase urine sodium. The BUN:SCr ratio is the most useful in determining the cause of acute kidney injury, which is expected in this patient. A ratio greater than 20 suggests pre-renal failure, while a ratio less than 10 suggests intrinsic renal failure. A ratio between 10 and 20 suggests a mix of pre-renal and intrinsic causes, and a ratio of <15:1 suggests intrinsic renal disease."

A BUN:SCr ratio < 15:1 is suggestive of pre-renal AKI, which can be caused by decreased blood flow to the kidneys due to hypotension in this case. Urinary osmolality < 350 mOsmol/kg is also expected in pre-renal AKI. Urine sodium > 40 mEq/L is suggestive of intrinsic renal AKI, which is less likely in this case."

With decreased urine output, one would expect a BUN:SCr ratio of greater than 20:1 in pre-renal acute kidney injury due to reduced perfusion of the kidneys. In septic shock, however, it is more likely to see an intrinsic renal insult (ATN) with a BUN:SCr ratio of less than 15:1. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. Urinary osmolality < 350 mOsmol/kg and urine sodium > 40 mEq/L indicate intrinsic renal pathology. Urinary osmolality > 500 mOsmol/kg indicates oliguria due to pre-renal acute kidney injury."

A low urinary osmolality suggests renal failure, which is possible but not specified in the question stem. Urine sodium >40 mEq/L can be seen in prerenal azotemia, but this patient\u2019s oliguria is likely due to acute kidney injury from sepsis."

The patient is presenting with symptoms of sepsis and possible septic shock, with decreased urinary output indicating acute kidney injury. Option C is the correct answer because a BUN:SCr ratio of less than 15:1 is indicative of prerenal azotemia, which occurs when there is decreased blood flow to the kidneys, as in sepsis. Option A, urinary osmolality > 500 mOsmol/kg, is not correct because in the setting of acute kidney injury, urinary osmolality is typically low. Option B, urinary osmolality < 350 mOsmol/kg, is also incorrect because this level of urinary osmolality indicates a significant inability to concentrate urine, which is typically seen in the setting of chronic kidney disease rather than acute kidney injury. Option D, urine sodium > 40 mEq/L, is typically seen in the setting of prerenal azotemia, but the correct answer is C because the BUN:SCr ratio is a more specific indicator."
