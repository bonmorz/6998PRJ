The patient's symptoms, including hallucinations and paranoia, suggest stimulant-induced psychosis, which can be caused by cocaine use. Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder and Pick disease is a type of frontotemporal dementia characterized by behavioral changes and language impairments. Schizophrenia can present with similar symptoms, but in this scenario, cocaine use is the most likely cause."
