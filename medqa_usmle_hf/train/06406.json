Option C is incorrect because the lifetime risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is increased in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. Option D is the most accurate statement because significant elevation of transaminases is not expected in infants with acute hepatitis B infection."

Option (C) is incorrect because hepatitis B infection is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma later in life.

Option B is incorrect because chronic infection is a significant risk for infants born to mothers with hepatitis B. Option C is incorrect because chronic infection with hepatitis B can lead to an increased risk of liver cancer.
