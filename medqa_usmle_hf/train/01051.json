However, it is important to note that including more participants could also potentially introduce confounding variables that were not accounted for in the original analysis."

Therefore, the most likely effect would be an increased probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually false. Choice A and B are not necessarily true, as the significance level and confidence intervals depend on other factors besides sample size. Choice D, external validity, is not affected by the addition of more participants."

Including additional participants in the analysis may increase the power of the study and decrease the probability of Type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis).

This is because the sample size and statistical power of the study would be increased with the inclusion of more participants."
