The patient is presenting with symptoms that suggest an aortic dissection, as seen from the widened mediastinum on chest x-ray. The most appropriate next step in management is transesophageal echocardiography to confirm the diagnosis and further characterize the aortic dissection. Gadolinium-enhanced MRA and contrast-enhanced CT angiography can also be used to diagnose aortic dissection, but transesophageal echocardiography is often preferred due to its higher sensitivity in detecting dissection flap and involvement of aortic valve. Aortography is an invasive procedure and is not necessary as the diagnosis can be made non-invasively using the other imaging modalities mentioned."
