The description of the burnt areas suggests that the patient most likely suffered from deep-partial thickness (3rd degree) burns. The skin is mostly intact but the burn has penetrated deeply into the skin, resulting in tissue destruction, loss of pain sensation, and softness on palpation. Superficial burns only affect the epidermis, while superficial-partial thickness burns affect the epidermis and some portion of the dermis. Electric burns have a characteristic pattern of entry and exit wounds."

Electric burns usually have a characteristic pattern and can involve deep structures such as bone and muscle, but the question does not provide enough information to suggest an electric burn."

The patient's burns affect 40% of his body and have blackened and charred appearance, indicating a deep-partial thickness (3rd degree) burn. The loss of pain sensation and minimal blanching on palpation also suggest a deep-partial thickness burn, as nerve endings and blood vessels are destroyed in this type of burn, resulting in decreased sensation and minimal blanching. Superficial-partial thickness (2nd degree) burns would have blisters on the skin surface and blanching on palpation. Superficial (1st degree) burns only affect the top layer of skin and result in redness and pain, while an electric burn usually occurs at the site of contact and can cause tissue damage as well as internal damage."
