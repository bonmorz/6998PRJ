The patient presents with sudden, severe pain and swelling in her lower extremity, which is asymmetric and accompanied by anasarca. These symptoms are consistent with nephrotic syndrome, which can cause blood clots due to loss of antithrombin III in the urine and hypercoagulability. The laboratory studies show elevated creatinine and low calcium, which are also consistent with nephrotic syndrome. The other options listed are causes of thrombophilia but are not the most likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results."

The patient presents with sudden, severe pain and swelling in her lower extremity, anasarca, and asymmetric lower extremity swelling.

The laboratory studies show elevated creatinine and low calcium, which are consistent with nephrotic syndrome. Factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutation are genetic abnormalities that increase the risk for blood clots but are not associated with the symptoms presented.

The elevated potassium level may be due to renal impairment caused by the syndrome.

Liver failure may cause edema, but would not explain the hypoproteinemia."
