The most likely initial treatment for hyperkalemia is to antagonize the membrane action of hyperkalemia, which is option A. This can be achieved with medications such as calcium gluconate or insulin and glucose. Option B is incorrect because blocking beta-adrenergic receptors is used to treat hypertension and cardiac conditions, not hyperkalemia. Option C is incorrect because preventing platelet aggregation is used to treat clotting disorders, not hyperkalemia. Option D is incorrect because increasing potassium loss from the gastrointestinal tract is used to treat hypokalemia, not hyperkalemia."

The lab tests show hypokalemia, hypernatremia, and elevated creatinine and BUN levels, which are consistent with acute kidney injury. The ECG findings suggest hyperkalemia, which can cause the reported symptoms. The most likely initial treatment for hyperkalemia is an agent that antagonizes the membrane action of hyperkalemia, such as calcium gluconate. This agent stabilizes the cardiac cell membrane and prevents cardiac arrhythmias caused by hyperkalemia. Options (B) and (C) are not relevant to this patient's condition, and option (D) aims to decrease potassium level, but it does not address the acute hyperkalemia."
