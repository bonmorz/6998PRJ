Initiation of anticoagulation with heparin and a bridge to warfarin is the most appropriate treatment plan for this patient to prevent further clot formation and possible pulmonary artery occlusion. tPA is a thrombolytic agent and is not typically used in non-massive PE cases, and IVC filter placement is not indicated in this patient as it does not treat the underlying cause of the PE."

Since he has a history of gout, using tPA may lead to joint space hemorrhage, and with his past injection drug use, there may be an increased risk of bleeding. Additionally, the patient also has hypertension, which can lead to intracranial bleeding. Therefore, warfarin anticoagulation with a bridge therapy of heparin is the most appropriate treatment plan. Consulting an interventional radiologist for IVC filter placement may be appropriate in patients with contraindications to anticoagulation or recurrent PE despite adequate anticoagulation."
