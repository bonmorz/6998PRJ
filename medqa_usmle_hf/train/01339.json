The guidelines state that the decision to screen for prostate cancer should be based on shared decision-making between the patient and the physician, taking into account the patient's individual risk factors and preferences. In this case, the patient is older and has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia and percutaneous coronary angioplasty, which may increase his risk of complications from screening and treatment. Therefore, it is appropriate to discuss the risks and benefits of screening with the patient and inform him that no screening test is recommended unless he expresses a strong preference for it."

Serum PSA testing every 2-4 years may be considered in men with a life expectancy greater than 10 years who are at higher risk for prostate cancer."
