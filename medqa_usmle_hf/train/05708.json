A high-dose phosphate infusion will cause an increase in serum phosphate levels, which will stimulate the parathyroid gland to release parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH stimulates osteoclasts to break down bone tissue to increase serum calcium levels. The increase in serum calcium levels stimulates the thyroid gland to release calcitonin, which inhibits bone breakdown and promotes calcium deposition. Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, is synthesized from the precursor molecule in response to decreased serum calcium levels. It enhances calcium absorption from the intestines and promotes the reabsorption of calcium from the kidneys, thereby increasing serum calcium levels. Urine phosphate levels decrease as a result of increased reabsorption in the kidneys. Therefore, the most likely set of changes in response to the infusion is an increase in serum parathyroid hormone, serum total calcium, and serum calcitriol levels, as well as a decrease in urine phosphate levels, which corresponds to option (C)."

Hyperphosphatemia can lead to a decrease in serum calcium levels by binding with calcium ions and forming insoluble precipitates. This can stimulate the release of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from the parathyroid gland, which increases the production of calcitriol (active form of vitamin D) and promotes the reabsorption of calcium from bones and the intestine. The high-dose phosphate infusion in this scenario would mimic hyperphosphatemia and would likely cause an increase in PTH, calcitriol, and serum calcium levels, as well as an increase in urine phosphate excretion as the body attempts to excrete the excess phosphate. Thus, the most likely set of changes is (C) \u2191 \u2191 \u2191 \u2191."
