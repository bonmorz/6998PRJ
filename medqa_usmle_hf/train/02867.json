However, the question specifies that his gout is under control, so we can eliminate that as a potential cause of the symptoms. The patient's current medications include metformin for diabetes and a hypertensive drug for hypertension. The hypertension medication is the most likely cause of the symptoms, and the options include ARBs, CCBs, ACE inhibitors, and thiazide diuretics. Thiazide diuretics have been associated with gout attacks, and may have caused this patient's symptoms."

Thiazide diuretics can increase uric acid levels and lead to gout attacks. They can also cause hyperglycemia and worsen diabetes. Over-the-counter multivitamin supplements are unlikely to cause these symptoms. ARBs and ACE inhibitors are used to treat hypertension and would not cause symptoms related to gout.
