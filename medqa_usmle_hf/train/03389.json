The patient has a high risk of infection due to his multiple past incarcerations and bruises, and the location of the lacerations on the MCP joints puts him at an increased risk for joint infections. Therefore, surgical irrigation, debridement, and antibiotics (such as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) are necessary. Option A is not appropriate as it does not cover Staphylococcus aureus, a common pathogen in hand infections. Closure of the wound with sutures (option B) is not recommended as it increases the risk of infection. No further management (option C) is not appropriate given the risks outlined above."
