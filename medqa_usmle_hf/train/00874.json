Phenoxybenzamine is used first to block alpha-receptors before using beta-blockers like propranolol, as beta-blockers alone can cause unopposed alpha stimulation and worsen hypertension in these patients. Therefore, the next best step is phenoxybenzamine followed by propranolol. Amlodipine and hydralazine are not the first-line treatment for pheochromocytoma."
