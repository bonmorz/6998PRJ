An increase in temperature can cause a right shift of the hemoglobin dissociation curve, which means oxygen is released more readily from hemoglobin to tissues. Option A, decrease in 2,3-DPG, is associated with a left shift of the curve, which means oxygen is held more tightly by hemoglobin. Option C, decrease in temperature, would have no effect on the curve shift. Option D, increase in CO production, is not related to the shift of the curve."

An increase in temperature decreases the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, which facilitates oxygen delivery to tissues under conditions of stress.

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or cellulitis, with a red and swollen leg with an ill-defined edge and tenderness and warmth. The presentation of venous stasis ulcers also supports a diagnosis of DVT. An increase in temperature, as seen in the patient\u2019s fever, can cause a right shift in the hemoglobin dissociation curve, meaning that hemoglobin is less bound to oxygen at a given partial pressure of oxygen. This helps facilitate oxygen delivery to tissues that are inflamed or infected. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they do not relate to the patient\u2019s condition."
