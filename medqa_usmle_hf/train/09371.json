The family history of a bleeding disorder in the maternal uncle increases the suspicion for a genetic disorder such as hemophilia. Prolonged partial thromboplastin time is characteristic of hemophilia, and further testing should be done to confirm the diagnosis. Decreased platelet count is associated with thrombocytopenia, which can cause bleeding, but it is not likely the cause in this patient. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated antinuclear antibody levels are associated with autoimmune disorders, which are less likely causes of hemarthrosis in a 3-year-old boy."
