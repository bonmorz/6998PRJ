The patient is showing signs of being emotionally and physically dependent on her husband, which is a characteristic of dependent personality disorder. The patient is afraid to leave her husband and is convinced that nobody would hire her, indicating she lacks self-confidence and relies heavily on others to meet her emotional and physical needs. The bruises also suggest that she may have been physically abused by her husband. None of the other options explain the patient\u2019s symptoms as well as dependent personality disorder."
