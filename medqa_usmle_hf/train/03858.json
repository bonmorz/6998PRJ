Decreased haptoglobin levels are a laboratory finding commonly seen in hemolytic anemia as haptoglobin binds to free hemoglobin released from red blood cells and is therefore depleted in the setting of hemolysis. Decreased reticulocyte count and mean corpuscular volume are not typical findings in immune hemolysis, and an increased direct to total bilirubin ratio is more commonly seen in obstructive jaundice."

The positive direct antiglobulin test confirms it is an autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), which can be caused by a number of conditions such as infectious mononucleosis. Decreased haptoglobin levels are associated with hemolytic anemia, as haptoglobin binds to hemoglobin released from the ruptured red blood cells. The other options are less likely associated with AIHA. Decreased reticulocyte count suggests decreased production of new red blood cells, which is not the case here. Decreased mean corpuscular volume is associated with a chronic anemia due to deficient iron stores, that is not the case here either. An increased direct to total bilirubin ratio occurs in obstructive jaundice."

The symptoms suggest hemolytic anemia, as evidenced by the low hemoglobin concentration and positive direct antiglobulin test. The icterus and pale mucous membranes suggest increased bilirubin, and the positive heterophile antibody test suggests infectious mononucleosis. In hemolytic anemia, haptoglobin levels are decreased as it binds to free hemoglobin to be cleared by the reticuloendothelial system. Therefore, answer choice (B) is the correct option. Decreased reticulocyte count and decreased mean corpuscular volume would not be expected in hemolytic anemia. The direct to total bilirubin ratio may be increased in hepatocellular jaundice, but this is not the most likely diagnosis in this case."
