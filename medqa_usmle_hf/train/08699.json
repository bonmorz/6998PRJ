The features described are consistent with a pilocytic astrocytoma, which is a common brain tumor in children and can present with progressive symptoms such as headaches, gait abnormalities, and ataxia. Acoustic schwannoma primarily affects the vestibular nerve, which is not consistent with the symptoms presented by the patient. Oligodendroglioma and ependymoma may have different clinical manifestations and imaging features. However, the MRI findings, showing a cystic lesion with an enhancing mural nodule, are highly suggestive of a pilocytic astrocytoma."
