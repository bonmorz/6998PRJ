Ultrasonography confirms the diagnosis. The most appropriate next step in management is to treat using a harness, such as a Pavlik harness, as early intervention with conservative measures like bracing or casting can lead to a more favorable outcome than delayed intervention. Closed reduction may be considered if conservative measures fail after a few weeks. Reassurance and follow-up in 4 weeks are not adequate management options. MRI is not indicated at this stage."

The palpable clunk after abduction of the right hip and an angle of 50\u00b0 between lines along the bone acetabulum and the ilium suggest developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Treatment for DDH in infants includes the use of a harness for correction. Option A is not appropriate as DDH requires prompt treatment. Option B is not recommended in infants unless closed reduction under anesthesia has failed. Option C may be required for confirmation or further evaluation, but is not as the initial step in management."
