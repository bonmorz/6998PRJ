The symptoms and MRI findings suggest acute stroke, and since the patient has sickle cell disease, the most appropriate initial step in management is exchange transfusion therapy. This helps to reduce the sickle cell count and promote circulation. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator therapy is recommended within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptoms onset, which has already been exceeded in this case. Hydroxyurea therapy can help reduce sickle cell-related complications but will not resolve acute stroke symptoms. Aspirin therapy is not appropriate in this case as the patient has an evolving cerebral infarction."

The symptoms, including weakness and sensory loss on one side, suggest a possible sickle cell crisis leading to a cerebral infarction. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in management is exchange transfusion therapy to replace sickled red blood cells with normal ones. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator therapy is not appropriate for an evolving cerebral infarction in a patient with sickle cell disease. Hydroxyurea therapy is used for sickle cell disease but not for an acute crisis. Aspirin therapy may be given in combination with exchange transfusion therapy, but exchange transfusion is the more urgent intervention."
