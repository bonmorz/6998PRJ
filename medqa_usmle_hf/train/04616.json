Prophylactic colonic resection is not recommended without definitive evidence of precancerous or cancerous lesions. Waiting until the age of 50 to begin screening is not appropriate given the family history and high-risk mutation."

Option A, prophylactic colonic resection, is not recommended as the son is only 20 years old and does not have any signs or symptoms of colon cancer at this time. Option B, not testing the son, is not appropriate as Lynch syndrome can lead to early onset colon cancer.
