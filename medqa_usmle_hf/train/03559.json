The patient presents with severe lower back pain for 3 weeks, tenderness over the second and third lumbar vertebrae, and laboratory findings suggestive of infection. An x-ray and MRI show bone destruction and sequestrum formation. The most likely diagnosis is osteomyelitis. A CT-guided biopsy would be the most appropriate next step in management to confirm the diagnosis and guide antibiotic therapy. Surgical debridement may be necessary in some cases but is not the first-line treatment. Prostate-specific antigen assay and isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol are not relevant to the diagnosis or management of osteomyelitis."
