Diphyllobothrium latum infection causes vitamin B12 deficiency, but it is typically associated with consumption of raw or undercooked fish, which the patient denies. Celiac disease is another malabsorption syndrome but it causes specific antibodies to be identified, which are not mentioned in the question stem."
