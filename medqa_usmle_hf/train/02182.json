An ecological study is defined as an observational study that examines the association between an exposure and an outcome at a population level rather than an individual level. In this case, the exposure is national cesarean section rates and the outcome is national maternal mortality rates, both at a population level for various countries. Therefore, the best description of this study design is an ecological study. A case series involves a description of a small group of patients with similar characteristics or conditions, a meta-analysis involves a statistical aggregation of results from multiple studies, and a prospective cohort study involves following a group of individuals over time to determine the association between exposure and outcome."
