Enalapril and bisoprolol are both medications used to treat heart failure and have been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in such patients. Metoprolol is also used to treat heart failure, but indapamide may exacerbate hypokalemia, which can worsen heart failure symptoms. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker and is not typically used as first-line therapy for heart failure. Valsartan and spironolactone may be used in certain cases of heart failure, but the patient is already taking torsemide, a loop diuretic, and adding another diuretic such as spironolactone may lead to electrolyte imbalances."

Option C (Indapamide and amlodipine) also contains a diuretic and amlodipine may exacerbate the patient's pedal edema. Option D (Valsartan and spironolactone) contains an aldosterone antagonist which can be useful in patients with heart failure, but it can also lead to hyperkalemia and worsening renal function in patients with decreased renal function."
