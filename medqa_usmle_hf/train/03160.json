The tingling and muscle contractions suggest hypocalcemia, which can be caused by decreased intestinal absorption of calcium due to celiac disease and vegan diet. The high parathyroid hormone concentration suggests parathyroid gland dysfunction trying to compensate for the hypocalcemia. Decreased levels of renal 1\u03b1-hydroxylase will result in decreased activation of vitamin D, but this is not the underlying cause. Decreased dietary intake of ergocalciferol will result in vitamin D deficiency but not hypocalcemia. Autoimmune-mediated destruction of parathyroid tissue will result in hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia, but the parathyroid hormone concentration is high in this patient."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest hypocalcemia, which can be caused by a deficiency in vitamin D due to decreased intestinal absorption. Celiac disease can cause damage to the small intestine, which can lead to decreased absorption of vitamin D. The high parathyroid hormone concentration suggests secondary hyperparathyroidism due to hypocalcemia, rather than destruction of parathyroid tissue or a decrease in renal 1\u03b1-hydroxylase activity. Dietary intake of ergocalciferol is not mentioned as a significant factor in this case."

This can cause hypocalcemia, which can result in involuntary contractions of muscles (tetany) and tingling around the mouth and fingertips. The high parathyroid hormone concentration indicates parathyroid gland hyperplasia, which is the body's attempt to compensate for the hypocalcemia. Option A (decreased levels of renal 1\u03b1-hydroxylase) is incorrect because it relates to secondary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic renal failure. Option B (decreased dietary intake of ergocalciferol) is also incorrect because this patient has been following a vegan diet for the past 2 years, and ergocalciferol is found in plant sources such as mushrooms. Option D (autoimmune-mediated destruction of parathyroid tissue) is incorrect because this patient has parathyroid gland hyperplasia, not hypoparathyroidism."

The patient's symptoms suggest hypocalcemia, and her low intake of calcium due to celiac disease and a vegan diet can lead to decreased intestinal absorption of vitamin D (ergocalciferol), which is necessary for calcium absorption. Decreased levels of renal 1\u03b1-hydroxylase would decrease the production of active vitamin D, but this option does not explain the patient's low calcium intake. Decreased dietary intake of ergocalciferol is not the most likely cause since the patient has been taking a vitamin D supplement, which is not mentioned in the question stem. Autoimmune-mediated destruction of parathyroid tissue would lead to decreased production of parathyroid hormone, not increased as seen in this patient."

The vegan diet may also contribute to low calcium and vitamin D intake. Option A and B are incorrect as they relate to vitamin D metabolism or intake, but not absorption.

The patient\u2019s symptoms and physical examination suggest hypocalcemia, which is a common complication of celiac disease due to malabsorption of nutrients including vitamin D. The fact that she has been following a vegan diet for the past 2 years likely exacerbates the malabsorption. Option (C), decreased intestinal absorption of ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), is the most likely underlying cause of her condition. The high parathyroid hormone concentration supports the diagnosis of hypocalcemia. Option (A), decreased levels of renal 1\u03b1-hydroxylase, would result in decreased production of vitamin D3, but this is not likely the cause of her hypocalcemia. Option (B), decreased dietary intake of ergocalciferol, is possible, but less likely given her vegan diet. Option (D), autoimmune-mediated destruction of parathyroid tissue, would result in hypoparathyroidism and low parathyroid hormone levels, which is not consistent with her laboratory findings."

This is likely due to decreased intestinal absorption of ergocalciferol (vitamin D), which can occur in both celiac disease and a strict vegan diet.

Option B refers to dietary intake of vitamin D, which is not the issue for this patient who is following a strict vegan diet.

The patient's symptoms suggest hypocalcemia, which is commonly associated with celiac disease due to malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D. As the patient has been following a vegan diet for the past 2 years, this further reduces her intake of vitamin D, which is obtained mainly from animal sources. The elevated PTH levels indicate secondary hyperparathyroidism due to low calcium levels, which can cause involuntary muscle contractions, also known as Chvostek's sign. The correct answer is therefore (C), decreased intestinal absorption of ergocalciferol (vitamin D)."
