The elevated bone-specific alkaline phosphatase concentration and normal urine deoxypyridinoline concentration suggest increased osteoblast activity, which is a sign of increased bone formation. Therefore, (B) is the most likely choice. None of the other options explain the laboratory findings. Decreased osteoclast activity would result in decreased bone resorption and a decrease in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase. Decreased parathyroid chief cell activity would result in decreased parathyroid hormone secretion, leading to decreased calcium reabsorption and elevated phosphorus concentration. Increased chondroblast activity would result in increased cartilage formation, not bone formation."
