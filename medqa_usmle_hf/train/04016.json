The HCO3- level of 21 mEq/L is within the normal range, ruling out metabolic acidosis. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Respiratory alkalosis."

The patient's cough and yellow sputum also suggest pneumonia, which may be further evaluated with chest imaging. The patient's history of smoking and hypertension may also increase his risk for pneumonia and respiratory alkalosis. Treatment may involve antibiotics, oxygen therapy, and supportive measures for his blood pressure."
