Antibodies to desmosomes are associated with pemphigus vulgaris, which presents with flaccid blisters and erosion of mucous membranes. Antibodies to epidural transglutaminase are associated with dermatitis herpetiformis. Epidermal necrolysis is a severe skin reaction that causes blistering and peeling of the skin."
