The patient presents with symptoms of exertional chest pain, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath, which suggest cardiovascular disease or dysfunction. A systolic ejection murmur at the right upper border is indicative of aortic stenosis, which results in increased blood flow velocity through the aortic valve. Bicuspid aortic valve can also lead to aortic stenosis, but it would not explain the patient's other symptoms or the systolic ejection murmur. The decreased murmur intensity with squatting is suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is not indicated by the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings. Pulsus paradoxus is a result of decreased cardiac output during inspiration and is generally associated with constrictive pericarditis or cardiac tamponade."

The patient has symptoms suggestive of stable angina or coronary artery disease, and the systolic ejection murmur at the right upper border suggests aortic stenosis. In aortic stenosis, blood flow velocity through the aortic valve is increased, leading to the murmur. Bicuspid aortic valve is a congenital abnormality and may also cause a systolic murmur, but the patient's history suggests acquired stenosis. Decreased murmur intensity with squatting is seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is not mentioned in the question stem. Pulsus paradoxus is a sign of cardiac tamponade, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms."
