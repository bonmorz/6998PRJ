Since the patient is diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia and ferrous sulfate syrup is prescribed, the first value to change in response to treatment would be an increase in reticulocyte count, indicating increased production of red blood cells.

The mean corpuscular hemoglobin is a measure of the average amount of hemoglobin in red blood cells and would decrease as red blood cells become smaller due to iron deficiency. The Mentzer index is a measure of the ratio of mean corpuscular volume to red blood cell count and is used to differentiate between iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia, but would not change specifically in response to iron supplementation."
