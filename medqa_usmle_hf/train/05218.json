The patient presents with symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea, including excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, and gasping during the night, and has an AHI of 8, which is considered mild. The most appropriate next step in management is continuous positive airway pressure, which is the gold standard treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. Oral appliances may be considered for patients with mild to moderate OSA who cannot tolerate or do not respond to CPAP. Supplemental oxygen does not treat the underlying cause of obstructive sleep apnea and may worsen hypoventilation. Upper airway surgery should only be considered after other treatment options have failed."

The patient has a BMI of 37 kg/m2 and a history of loud snoring and gasping during the night, which suggests obstructive sleep apnea. Polysomnography confirms this diagnosis with an apnea-hypopnea index of 8 episodes/h. The most appropriate next step in management is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to keep the airway open during sleep. Oral appliances and upper airway surgery are other treatment options but CPAP is the first-line therapy. Supplemental oxygen is not effective in treating obstructive sleep apnea."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) due to the enlarged tongue and uvula, low-lying soft palate, and BMI. Polysomnography confirms the diagnosis. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-line treatment for OSA. Oral appliances can also be used but are usually reserved for patients who cannot tolerate CPAP. Supplemental oxygen is not a useful treatment for OSA. Upper airway surgery can be considered in patients who fail CPAP and oral appliances or have anatomical abnormalities that can be corrected surgically. However, it is not appropriate as initial management in this patient."

The patient presents with excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, and gasping during the night which suggests obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The oropharyngeal examination confirms a small orifice, enlarged tongue and uvula, and low-lying soft palate - all risk factors for OSA. The polysomnography shows an apnea-hypopnea index of 8 which confirms the diagnosis of mild OSA. The most appropriate next step in management is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which is the first-line treatment for mild to severe OSA. Oral appliances can be considered for mild OSA, but CPAP is more effective. Supplemental oxygen is not recommended as a first-line treatment for OSA. Upper airway surgery is reserved for patients who have failed conservative management and have specific anatomical abnormalities that can be corrected surgically."
