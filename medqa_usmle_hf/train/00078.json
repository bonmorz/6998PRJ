The symptoms and laboratory studies suggest diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is characterized by hyperkalemia (increased total body potassium), not hypokalemia. DKA also leads to dehydration, which can cause hypernatremia (increased total body sodium) and hypovolemia, not hypervolemia. Metabolic acidosis, as evidenced by the low HCO3- level, can cause compensatory hyperventilation and a decrease in arterial pCO2, not an increase."
