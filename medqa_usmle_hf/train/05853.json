Herpes simplex virus can cause genital herpes with symptoms such as painful, blister-like lesions on the genitals. Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that can cause a wide range of symptoms including joint pain, skin rash, and fatigue, but it is not usually associated with urinary tract infections. Treponema pallidum is the bacterium that causes syphilis, which is not typically associated with urinary tract infections."
