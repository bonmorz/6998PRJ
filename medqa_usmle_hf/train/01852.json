Thrombin inhibitors, such as heparin, are given during the procedure to prevent clot formation, but the question asks about the next medication to be given after admission. Vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibitors, such as warfarin, are used for long-term anticoagulation but are not relevant in this acute setting. Cyclooxygenase activators, such as aspirin, are also used for long-term prevention of clot formation but are contraindicated in this patient due to her allergy."
