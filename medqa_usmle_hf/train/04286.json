Menorrhagia is often a symptom of a coagulation disorder. PTT measures the activity of the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation and can help diagnose coagulation disorders such as von Willebrand disease or hemophilia. Factor IX assay is used to diagnose hemophilia B. Anti-cardiolipin antibodies are associated with autoimmune disorders and can cause thrombosis, not bleeding. Prothrombin time is used to monitor warfarin therapy and diagnose liver disease, but is not as useful in diagnosing bleeding disorders as PTT."

The patient presents with menorrhagia and a history of persistent bleeding after a tooth extraction, suggesting a bleeding disorder. The PTT measures the activity of the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation and is a screening test for bleeding disorders, making it the most likely laboratory test to be of diagnostic value in this patient. Option A (Factor IX assay) would be useful in diagnosing hemophilia B, which is unlikely given the patient's history. Option C (anti-cardiolipin antibodies) would be useful in diagnosing antiphospholipid syndrome, which usually presents with thrombotic events rather than bleeding. Option D (PT) measures the activity of the extrinsic and common pathways of coagulation and is not as sensitive for diagnosing bleeding disorders as the PTT."
