The tall stature, long arms, scoliosis, and lens subluxation suggest Marfan syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene on chromosome 15. Defective methionine metabolism involves homocystinuria, which also causes lens subluxation but is not associated with scoliosis. COL5A1 and COL5A2 mutations are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which can cause joint hypermobility and skin elasticity but is not associated with lens subluxation.
