The symptoms and the photograph suggest that the most likely diagnosis is atheroembolism, which is a complication of percutaneous coronary intervention. Burger\u2019s syndrome is more commonly seen in men and presents with ischemia and gangrene of the toes. Cellulitis presents with erythema, swelling, and warmth, but not discoloration and gangrene seen in the photograph. Diabetic foot may cause ischemia and gangrene, but usually affects multiple toes and not just one."

Burger's syndrome primarily affects smokers, and there is no history of smoking mentioned in the question stem. Cellulitis would present with erythema and warmth, which are not present in the photograph. Diabetic foot ulcers may present with discoloration and ulceration, but atheroembolism is a more likely cause in this scenario."

The clinical picture of a patient with a history of diabetes who recently underwent coronary intervention and developed sudden severe pain in a small toe with the presence of livedo reticularis suggests atheroembolism. Burger\u2019s syndrome typically occurs in young (<50 years) male smokers and usually involves the toes and the foot. Cellulitis typically presents with erythema, warmth, and tenderness without livedo reticularis. Diabetic foot typically presents with slow-healing or nonhealing wounds, with or without associated infection."
