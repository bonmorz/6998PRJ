Among the options, reducing fish intake is the most appropriate health maintenance recommendation, as increased consumption of certain types of fish has been associated with a greater risk of gout. Aspirin is not recommended for gout and may actually worsen symptoms. Discontinuing pravastatin is not necessary, as it does not increase the risk of gout, and colchicine may be used for acute attacks but is not a preventative measure."
