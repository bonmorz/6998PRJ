The symptoms and the drug action described suggest that the drug prescribed is Entacapone, which is a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor that increases the bioavailability of levodopa by preventing its peripheral methylation. This allows more levodopa to reach the brain, where it is converted to dopamine, helping to improve the patient\u2019s symptoms. Ropinirole is a dopamine agonist, Amantadine is an NMDA receptor antagonist, and Rasagiline is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, which are all used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease but do not have the same mechanism of action as Entacapone."

Levodopa is a common medication for Parkinson's disease, but its efficacy may decrease over time due to peripheral methylation.

Ropinirole and Amantadine are also used to treat Parkinson's disease, but they do not increase the bioavailability of levodopa.
