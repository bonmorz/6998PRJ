The sudden onset of severe headache followed by neck stiffness and nuchal rigidity are consistent with a subarachnoid hemorrhage, and a non-contrast CT scan of the head may not always be sensitive enough to detect it. A lumbar puncture should be done to evaluate for the presence of blood in the CSF, which is diagnostic of subarachnoid hemorrhage. IV tPA is not indicated in this case as there is no evidence of acute ischemic stroke. Diffusion-weighted MRI is not a urgent diagnostic test for this presentation. Placement of a VP shunt is not indicated as there is no evidence of hydrocephalus at this time."
