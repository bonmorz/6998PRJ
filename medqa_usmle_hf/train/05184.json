The correct answer is (A) because if the spinous process is not in-between the two clavicular heads, the image is repeated to ensure proper positioning. The other options are incorrect as CXRs are typically taken with the patient standing upright or in a seated position, not supine; ribs 9 and 10 are usually visible in an inspiratory film, not expiratory; and the preferred view for a CXR is a posterior-anterior (PA) view, not an anteroposterior (AP) view."
