The patient's symptoms suggest an intraductal papilloma, which is a common benign tumor that can cause bloody discharge from the nipple. The absence of palpable masses and axillary lymphadenopathy, as well as the single dilated duct on ultrasonography, further support this diagnosis.

Invasive ductal carcinoma and Paget disease of the breast can both cause nipple discharge, but are typically associated with palpable masses and other imaging findings."
