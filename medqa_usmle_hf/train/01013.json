The high-pitched grating sound between S1 and S2 indicates pericardial friction rub, which can be present in acute pericarditis. The risk for cardiac tamponade is increased in patients with acute pericarditis due to the potential accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac. Options (A), (B), and (D) are not typically associated with acute pericarditis."

As pericarditis can lead to inflammation and accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac, there is an increased risk of cardiac tamponade. Options A and D are not common complications of pericarditis, and option B is unlikely as lung sounds were normal on examination."

Cardiac tamponade is a potential complication of pericarditis, in which fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac and compresses the heart, resulting in decreased cardiac output and potentially fatal complications. The high-pitched grating sound between S1 and S2, known as a pericardial friction rub, is a characteristic finding in pericarditis.
