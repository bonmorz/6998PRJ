Coarctation of the aorta and pheochromocytoma usually present at a younger age, and hypothyroidism is not commonly associated with hypertension."

The sudden increase in blood pressure and creatinine levels despite compliance with medications also support this possibility. Coarctation of the aorta is typically seen in younger patients and would not likely cause an abrupt increase in blood pressure.
