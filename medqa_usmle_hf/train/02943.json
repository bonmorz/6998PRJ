The maneuver described here which involves gentle massage below the left mandible stimulates the vagus nerve and activates the parasympathetic nervous system. This leads to slowing of conduction in the AV node and decreasing heart rate, resulting in an improvement in the patient's symptoms. Option A is incorrect because it refers to the refractory period in ventricular myocytes which is not affected by this maneuver. Option B is incorrect because it refers to the SA node, which is not impacted by the vagus nerve. Option D is incorrect because it refers to carotid baroreceptors, which are not involved in this mechanism."

Option B is incorrect as it refers to the SA node myocytes, which is not affected by carotid sinus massage. Option D is incorrect as carotid baroreceptors are being stimulated rather than decreased."

Gentle massage below the level of the left mandible elicits an immediate improvement in the patient, suggesting that the mechanism of action is by slowing conduction in the AV node. This maneuver is known as carotid sinus massage, which can be used to treat supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which is typically caused by reentry circuits within or around the AV node. Slowing conduction in the AV node can interrupt the reentry circuit and terminate the SVT."

The maneuver described is known as carotid sinus massage, and it is used to slow down the heart rate by stimulating the carotid sinus and activating the parasympathetic nervous system. This effect occurs due to the inhibition of the AV node, which slows down the conduction of electrical impulses through the heart. Options A and B are not related to the parasympathetic nervous system, and option D is incorrect because carotid baroreceptors function to regulate blood pressure, not heart rate."

The patient\u2019s symptoms of heart palpitations and response to massage directly below the mandible suggest that the maneuver acted on the carotid sinus, which is a pressure-sensitive receptor located at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. Stimulation of the carotid sinus via massage results in a reduction in heart rate due to slowed conduction in the AV node. Option A is incorrect because increasing the refractory period in ventricular myocytes would not result in a reduction in heart rate. Option B is incorrect because decreasing the length of phase 4 of the SA node myocytes would result in an increase in heart rate. Option D is incorrect because firing of carotid baroreceptors would result in an increase, not a decrease, in heart rate."

The maneuver of gentle massage below the level of the left mandible is known as the carotid sinus massage, which stimulates the baroreceptors within the carotid sinus. This leads to a decrease in sympathetic tone and a reflex increase in parasympathetic tone, which slows conduction in the AV node and reduces heart rate. This is a common method used to treat supraventricular tachycardia. Option (A) is incorrect because increasing the refractory period in ventricular myocytes would not have an immediate effect on heart rate, and option (B) is incorrect because the length of phase 4 of the SA node myocytes does not directly control heart rate. Option (D) is incorrect because the firing rate of carotid baroreceptors would not decrease heart rate."
