The history of altered mental status with confusion, lethargy, forgetfulness and hallucinations suggest delirium, which is a sudden change in mental function due to physical or mental illness. Dementia usually has a gradual onset and is characterized by cognitive decline. Transient global amnesia is a temporary episode of memory loss, and Wernicke's aphasia is characterized by difficulty with language comprehension and expression. Nuchal rigidity is absent, making meningitis and encephalitis less likely. Muscle strength is normal, making stroke and seizure less likely."
