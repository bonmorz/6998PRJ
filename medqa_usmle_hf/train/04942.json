The symptoms suggest hypothyroidism, and in a six-year-old, the most likely cause is a failed caudal migration of the thyroid gland, which leads to lingual thyroid. Surgery may be necessary if it causes problems with swallowing or breathing, as in this case. Radiation exposure may cause thyroid cancer, rather than benign mass. Iodine deficiency is a cause of goiter, which is an enlarged thyroid gland that is not typically located at the base of the tongue. Failed fusion of the palatine shelves with the nasal septum is a cause of cleft palate, which is not related to the patient\u2019s symptoms."
