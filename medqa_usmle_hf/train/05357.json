Among the options, duration of diastole determines the amount of time the coronary arteries have to perfuse the heart muscle. As heart rate increases, the duration of diastole decreases, leading to decreased cardiac perfusion. Coronary vasoconstriction can also contribute to decreased cardiac perfusion, but it is not the primary factor in this case. Diastolic aortic pressure and force of myocardial contraction are not directly related to coronary perfusion."

Among the options, the duration of diastole is the main contributor to decreased cardiac perfusion because it is the time during which the coronary arteries are perfused with blood. During exercise, the heart rate increases, which shortens the duration of diastole and reduces coronary blood flow. Coronary vasoconstriction can contribute to decreased perfusion, but it is not the main factor in this situation. Diastolic aortic pressure does affect coronary blood flow, but the duration of diastole is a more significant contributor. The force of myocardial contraction is not directly related to cardiac perfusion."
