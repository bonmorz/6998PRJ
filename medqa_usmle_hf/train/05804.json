The patient\u2019s condition is most likely atrial fibrillation due to excessive alcohol intake and work-related stress. The initial treatment should involve observation, as the patient has converted to normal sinus rhythm on his own, and the palpitations are only occasional at this point. Adenosine injection is more appropriate for supraventricular tachycardia, and defibrillation is used to treat ventricular fibrillation. Electrical cardioversion is only indicated if the patient has hemodynamic instability or ongoing symptoms despite medical therapy."
