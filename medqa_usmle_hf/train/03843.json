The patient's symptoms, such as involuntary loss of urine, intermittent urinary stream, and post-void residual urine volume, suggest detrusor sphincter dyssynergia.

The other options are less likely to be a cause of the patient's symptoms."

Impaired detrusor contractility is also unlikely as the bladder size is normal and the post-void residual urine volume is elevated, which suggests an obstruction rather than a lack of detrusor contractility."

The patient has an intermittent urinary stream and a high post-void residual urine volume, which suggests an obstruction in the bladder neck or urethra.

Cognitive impairment and impaired detrusor contractility are less likely causes, and vesicovaginal fistula is unlikely given the absence of abnormalities on pelvic examination."
