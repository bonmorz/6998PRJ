The clear cell renal cell carcinoma described in this scenario is graded according to nuclear morphology, mitotic rate, and amount of necrosis. Therefore, the degree of mitotic activity is necessary to determine the tumor grade. Size of malignant proliferation can help determine the stage of cancer, response to chemotherapy depends on a variety of factors, and involvement of regional lymph nodes helps with staging as well."
