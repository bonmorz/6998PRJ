The combination of lower back pain, urinary symptoms, paravertebral muscle spasm, and elevated serum calcium suggests metastatic prostate cancer.

Bone marrow biopsy can also help detect multiple myeloma, but serum protein electrophoresis is the first step in diagnosis. Serum vitamin D levels are not relevant in this case. Prostate biopsy is not indicated at this point as the patient\u2019s symptoms are suggestive of metastasis rather than a primary prostate cancer."
