Acute cholangitis would present with fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Acute viral hepatitis would present with elevated liver enzymes and jaundice.

The patient\u2019s history of alcohol abuse, laboratory findings, and physical examination are all suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis.

Acute cholangitis usually presents with fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice. Acute viral hepatitis may present with similar laboratory findings, but typically has a more acute onset and is associated with specific viral markers. Hereditary hemochromatosis may present with elevated serum iron and TIBC levels, but typically has a more insidious onset and is associated with a history of familial disease."
