The patient has undergone hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which reduces estrogen and testosterone levels. Decreased testosterone is a known cause of loss of libido. Chronic alcohol intake can also decrease libido, but the history does not suggest that it is the primary cause. Major depressive disorder and elevated prolactin can also cause loss of libido, but the history does not support these diagnoses."

The patient\u2019s history suggests that she underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which caused a decrease in testosterone production. Testosterone plays an important role in female sexual desire. Chronic alcohol intake can also affect sexual dysfunction, but the absence of other symptoms such as cirrhosis, ascites, or spider nevi makes it less likely. Although the patient reports feeling sad, it is not enough to diagnose major depressive disorder without further evaluation. There is no evidence to suggest elevated prolactin levels."
