The patient's symptoms, including ecchymoses (bruising), fatigue, and joint pain, suggest a Vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C is necessary for the formation of collagen, which is essential in blood vessel wall strength and platelet function. Vitamin A is important for vision and immune function, but deficiency is not associated with the symptoms described. Vitamin B6 is important in protein metabolism but deficiency is not associated with the symptoms described. Vitamin K is necessary for blood clotting, but the symptoms described are not suggestive of a Vitamin K deficiency."

The patient has been experiencing large bruises on his arms and legs, fatigue, and joint pain, and has a history of non-small cell lung carcinoma and is undergoing chemotherapy. Given the symptoms and medical history, the most likely answer is Vitamin C, which is necessary for collagen synthesis and can help improve bruising and skin health. None of the other vitamin options are directly related to the patient's symptoms or medical history."
