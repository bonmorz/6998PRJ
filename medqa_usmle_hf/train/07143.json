The symptoms of chest pain worsening when laying down and after eating meals, along with a bitter taste in the mouth, suggest gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Obesity is a risk factor for GERD, and hypothyroidism can cause decreased lower esophageal sphincter tone. Autodigestion of pancreatic tissue would present with severe and persistent abdominal pain, while blockage of the cystic duct would present with right upper quadrant pain and nausea. An atherosclerotic blockage of a coronary artery causing transient ischemia would present with chest pain on exertion, not worsened by laying down or eating meals."

The bitter taste in her mouth is a common symptom of GERD, and the worsening of pain with lying down and after eating supports this diagnosis. Autodigestion of pancreatic tissue is associated with acute pancreatitis, which presents with severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back. Blockage of the cystic duct leads to acute cholecystitis, which presents with right upper quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis. An atherosclerotic blockage of a coronary artery causing transient ischemia during times of increased cardiac demand produces angina."
