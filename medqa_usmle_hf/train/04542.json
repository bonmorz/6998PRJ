This suggests a potential causal relationship between smoking and Raynaud phenomenon, as the more tobacco someone uses, the more likely they are to have Raynaud phenomenon. Confounding refers to a third variable that affects both the exposure and outcome, consistency refers to the consistency of the association across different studies, and temporality refers to the exposure preceding the outcome. While these may also be important factors in determining causation, they are not represented in this specific study."
