As the patient is HIV-positive, she is at increased risk of complications from influenza and should receive vaccination. Option A is incorrect as anemia is not a contraindication for influenza vaccination. Option B is incorrect as nasal-spray vaccines are not recommended for immunocompromised patients. Option C is incorrect as even though the patient's CD4+ cell count is under 500 cells/\u00b5L, vaccination is still recommended and has been shown to be effective. Option D is the correct answer as the patient can receive any approved recombinant or inactivated vaccine, including ones produced with egg-based technology, as being allergic to egg whites does not contraindicate influenza vaccination."
