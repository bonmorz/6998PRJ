In this type of study, a group of individuals with similar characteristics (such as dietary patterns) is followed over time, and the incidence of HFrEF is compared between those who consume different amounts of glucose. This allows for the assessment of longitudinal causality. A randomized controlled trial would also be appropriate, but it may not be ethical or practical to randomly assign individuals to consume different amounts of glucose. Cross-sectional studies and case series cannot determine causality, as they only provide snapshots of data at a single point in time."
