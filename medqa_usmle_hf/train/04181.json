The patient has a history of severe chest discomfort after heavy meals or eating in the late evening, which suggests gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The upper endoscopy showed the presence of an esophageal ulcer. Weight loss, smoking and alcohol cessation, and omeprazole are recommended, but if these do not work, the most appropriate next step would be Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with hiatoplasty, which involves wrapping the upper part of the stomach around the lower esophageal sphincter to strengthen it and prevent acid reflux. Options A and D do not address the underlying problem of GERD, and laparoscopic herniotomy does not address the symptoms or complications of GERD."

Calcium carbonate therapy is an antacid, useful for mild and occasional symptoms, but not suitable for a severe case such as this."
