The patient presents with right-sided gaze deviation and decreased sensation to light touch on the right leg, indicating a lesion on the left side of the brain. The left hemisphere controls the right lower extremity and the opposite for the right hemisphere. Thus, we can rule out options B, C, and D as they involve the right hemisphere. Option A involves the anterior cerebral artery, which supplies the medial portion of the frontal and parietal lobes, including the leg area of the motor cortex. The decreased sensation in the right leg suggests that the occlusion is in the right anterior cerebral artery."
