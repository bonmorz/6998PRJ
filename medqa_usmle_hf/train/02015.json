Since there are no abnormalities found in physical examination, the most likely cause of respiratory alkalosis is hyperventilation syndrome, which can be caused by anxiety or stress. To confirm this diagnosis, the urine chloride level should be measured. In hyperventilation, there is renal excretion of bicarbonate ions and a retention of chloride ions leading to a low urine chloride level. This will rule out other causes of metabolic alkalosis such as vomiting or diuretic use."
