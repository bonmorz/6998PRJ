The image shows tonsillar enlargement with white exudates, which is characteristic of infectious mononucleosis caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV can become latent in B cells, leading to potential future reactivation. Therefore, option (C) is correct. Option (A) is incorrect as EBV is heterophile-positive. Option (B) is incorrect as Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a neoplastic condition and not caused by EBV. Option (D) is incorrect as EBV does not become latent in macrophages."
