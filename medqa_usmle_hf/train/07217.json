The presentation of sudden-onset severe headache, binocular horizontal diplopia, and ptosis suggests the diagnosis of a third nerve palsy. The absence of a pupillary response on the left indicates involvement of the parasympathetic fibers, which are carried in the third nerve. The most likely cause of this is an aneurysm, with the posterior communicating artery being the most common site. The image provided shows an aneurysm at the junction of the internal carotid artery and the posterior communicating artery."
