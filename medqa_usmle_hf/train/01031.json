The patient collapsed, has a family history of sudden cardiac arrest, and the ECG shows large R waves in the lateral leads and deep S waves in V1 and V2, which are all indicative of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (asymmetric septal hypertrophy). Aortic root dilatation does not cause these ECG findings. Eccentric left ventricular dilation can be seen in dilated cardiomyopathy, but this is not supported by the findings on the ECG. Mitral valve fibrinoid necrosis is seen in rheumatic heart disease, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation."
