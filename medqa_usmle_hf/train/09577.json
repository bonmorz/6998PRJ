The patient presents with symptoms of hypothyroidism, including fatigue, weight gain, constipation, myalgias, cold intolerance, and delayed deep tendon reflex relaxation. The best initial screening test for hypothyroidism is serum TSH. Levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies would be helpful in diagnosing autoimmune thyroiditis, but not as the initial screening test. Morning cortisol and plasma ACTH would be helpful in evaluating adrenal insufficiency, but not as the initial screening test. Hemoglobin and hematocrit would be helpful in evaluating anemia, but not as the initial screening test."
