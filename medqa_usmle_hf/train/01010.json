The symptoms suggest a pleural effusion, as there is chest pain and difficulty breathing, and the physical examination findings support this as there is decreased resonance on percussion and absence of breath sounds on the affected side. The deviation of the trachea to the left suggests a large volume of fluid on the right side, causing a shift of the mediastinum. Atelectasis would not cause the tracheal deviation and would likely present with decreased breath sounds and decreased resonance. Pneumonia would present with localized abnormal breath sounds and would not cause tracheal deviation. Pneumothorax would present with decreased or absent breath sounds, but would also cause decreased resonance and other symptoms that are not present here."
