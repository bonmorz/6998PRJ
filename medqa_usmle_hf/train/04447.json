Both of these factors can lead to anovulatory cycles, which is the most likely cause of her missed periods. Primary ovarian insufficiency would typically result in consistently missed periods, and uterine leiomyomas would cause abnormal bleeding rather than missed periods. The hormone levels provided do not suggest either of these conditions. The medication, risperidone, could be a contributing factor to the anovulatory cycles."
