The patient is prescribed sertraline, which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that increases the level of serotonin in the brain. This suggests that the patient's symptoms are related to a deficiency in serotonin. The adjunctive treatment that lacks anticonvulsant or muscle relaxant properties suggests a medication that works specifically on serotonin. Among the options, 5HT-1A receptor is involved in serotonin regulation and is the most likely receptor targeted by the adjunctive treatment."

Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that helps increase the levels of serotonin in the brain, which can improve anxiety and depression symptoms. The fact that the added medication lacks anticonvulsant or muscle relaxant properties is a clue that it is not targeting GABA or alpha adrenergic receptors. Glycine receptor is not typically involved in anxiety or depression. The most likely option is 5HT-1A receptor, which is a subtype of serotonin receptor and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety and depression. Adding a 5HT-1A agonist to an SSRI can improve symptoms by targeting different serotonin receptors."
