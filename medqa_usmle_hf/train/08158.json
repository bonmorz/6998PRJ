Conjugate eye deviation to the right suggests the left cortical hemisphere is affected. Decreased sensation on the left side, worse in the left face and left upper extremity and weakness and drooping of the lower half of the left face suggest contralateral cortical involvement. Homonymous hemianopsia occurs when there is a loss of vision in the same part of the visual field in both eyes, which is a common finding with strokes involving the cerebral hemispheres. Neither Amaurosis fugax nor Profound lower limb weakness typically occurs in strokes involving the lateral convexity of the cerebral hemisphere. Prosopagnosia is a deficit in recognizing faces, which is usually due to damage to the temporal cortex, not the lateral convexity of the cerebral hemisphere."

The patient presents with symptoms of a stroke on the left side of the body, which suggests that the stroke occurred in the right cerebral hemisphere. Conjugate eye deviation suggests that the stroke may have involved the middle cerebral artery. Among the options, homonymous hemianopsia is the most common visual field defect associated with a middle cerebral artery stroke. Amaurosis fugax is associated with a brief, temporary loss of vision and is more commonly seen in carotid artery disease. Profound lower limb weakness and prosopagnosia are not typically associated with a stroke in this location."
