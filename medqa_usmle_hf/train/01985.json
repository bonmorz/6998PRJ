The patient's symptoms, including the painful tongue lesion and the knot-like swellings on the left temple, are consistent with giant cell arteritis. The laboratory findings showing elevated ESR further supports this diagnosis. The next best step in management would be to initiate high-dose systemic corticosteroids to prevent potential blindness, facial paralysis, or aortic aneurysm. CT or lysis therapy are not appropriate for the management of this condition. Paracetamol may provide some pain relief but does not address the underlying condition."

High-dose systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for GCA, and should be initiated urgently to prevent irreversible visual loss.
