Increasing the oxygen flow rate won't improve the patient's hypercapnia, and may even worsen it by suppressing the respiratory drive. Intubation and invasive ventilation should be reserved for severe respiratory failure, and oral corticosteroids are not typically used in the management of COPD exacerbations. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD, particularly those with hypercapnic respiratory failure. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient would be to start NIPPV."

Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is appropriate for treatment of acute respiratory failure in patients with COPD exacerbation to help decrease the work of breathing and improve gas exchange.
