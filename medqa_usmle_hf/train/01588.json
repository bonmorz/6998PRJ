The shrunken kidneys with papillary calcifications on ultrasound indicate a diagnosis of chronic interstitial nephritis. Among the options, only inhibition of prostacyclin production can cause such renal damage. Excess amount of light chain production can cause amyloidosis which will damage the kidneys, but there is no mention of amyloidosis in this scenario. Precipitation of drugs within the renal tubules can cause acute renal failure, not chronic. MUC1 gene mutation is associated with cancers, not chronic kidney disease."
