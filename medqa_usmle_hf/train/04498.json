Liver enzyme elevation, QT prolongation, and serum drug level are not specific indicators of anticholinergic toxicity."

The patient's symptoms and history suggest drug overdose, possibly due to her depression medication or a deliberate overdose.

Liver enzyme elevations and QT prolongation may also occur with certain drug overdoses, but are not as reliable indicators of toxicity as QRS prolongation. Serum drug level may be helpful in identifying the specific drug involved, but does not provide information on the extent of toxicity."
