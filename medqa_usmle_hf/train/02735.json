The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest autonomic dysfunction, as she experienced fainting episodes while standing and getting out of bed. The fact that she has had similar episodes in the past also supports this diagnosis. The normal results from previous tests for cardiac abnormalities and electrolyte imbalances suggest that these are unlikely to be the cause. Adrenal insufficiency is also unlikely given the absence of relevant symptoms and laboratory findings. The presence of rare premature ventricular contractions and T-wave inversions in lead III does not necessarily indicate a structural cardiac abnormality as these can be present in normal individuals."
