The first step in definitive treatment of this condition is alpha-blockers followed by beta-blockers. This is because alpha-blockers reduce blood pressure by blocking the effects of catecholamines on alpha receptors, and then beta-blockers can be added to control the remaining hypertension. Emergent surgery is an option in some cases, but it is not the first step in treatment. Hydralazine is not recommended in pheochromocytoma because it can lead to hypertension crisis due to reflex sympathetic activation."
