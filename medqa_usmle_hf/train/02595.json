Among the options, Bupropion is the most appropriate medication because it not only treats depression, but also helps with smoking cessation, and can even have a stimulant effect that can counteract the fatigue and loss of interest in activities. Venlafaxine and Fluoxetine are also used to treat depression, but do not have the added benefit of smoking cessation. Trazodone is commonly used for insomnia or sleep issues but has no benefits for smoking cessation or treating depression."
