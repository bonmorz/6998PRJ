Corticosteroids can affect the levels of white blood cells, leading to a decrease in lymphocytes and an increase in neutrophils. Fibroblasts are not typically affected by corticosteroids, and eosinophils may or may not be affected. Therefore, the most likely answer is (D), which shows a decrease in lymphocytes and an increase in neutrophils, but no change in eosinophils or fibroblasts."
