Serology testing should be performed to determine if the patient is already immune to varicella. If the patient is not immune, then two doses of vaccine should be administered. Option B is incorrect because if the patient is not immune, they will need two doses of the vaccine, not just one. Option C is correct in terms of the number of doses needed, but serology testing should still be done to determine if the patient is already immune. Option D is not recommended because the patient's occupation puts them at risk for exposure to varicella, and waiting until age 50 poses an unnecessary risk for infection."

Option B, serology then administer the vaccine (1 dose), is incorrect because if the patient is not immune, he should receive 2 doses of the vaccine. Option C, two doses of vaccine, assumes the patient is not immune without testing, and option D, wait until the patient turns 50, is incorrect because the patient is currently working in a childcare center and may be exposed to the virus."
