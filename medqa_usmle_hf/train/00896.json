The past medical history of HIV with low CD4 count puts the patient at risk for opportunistic infections such as Toxoplasmosis. Therefore, option A is a consideration, but it is not the best initial step. Empiric treatment with pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine would be appropriate for suspected Toxoplasmosis, however, the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest a possible stroke or other brain lesion. Therefore, the best initial step in management is to perform a head CT to evaluate for possible intracranial pathology. Option D is not indicated in this patient, as it is used for fungal infections and is not likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms."
