The drug administered likely has lower efficacy, meaning it can produce similar effects as oxycodone but without causing euphoria. Lower bioavailability would mean lower absorption of the drug in the body, while lower affinity would mean the drug has weaker binding to the receptors. Lower tolerance would mean that the body has not built up a tolerance to the drug, but this does not explain the difference in effect."

The question refers to a drug that provides a similar effect to oxycodone but does not cause euphoria, suggesting a drug that is less effective. Therefore, the correct answer is lower efficacy. Lower bioavailability refers to the amount of drug that reaches the site of action, lower affinity refers to the strength of binding between the drug and its receptor, and lower tolerance refers to a decrease in the response to a drug after repeated exposure. None of these options explain the difference in effect described in the question."
