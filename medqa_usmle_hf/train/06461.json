The reagent used to break the hydrogen bonds is usually a high-pH buffer or a chemical denaturant. The artificial DNA primers are complementary to the target DNA sequence and during the heating step (denaturation), they bind to the target DNA strands. Taq polymerase (derived from Thermus aquaticus) is then added to the mixture to extend the primers, creating new copies of the target sequence. This process is repeated multiple times (usually around 30 cycles) to amplify the target DNA for further analysis. Immunohistochemistry is used to examine tissue samples, Northern blot and Western blot are used to detect specific RNA and protein molecules, respectively."
