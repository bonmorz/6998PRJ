The fact that the drug prescribed is cardiotoxic and may result in ECG changes narrows down the options to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Among the options, only (C) inhibits the uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine at the presynaptic terminal, which is the mechanism of action of TCAs."

The patient presents with symptoms of depression and migraine headaches, which suggest the prescribed drug is an antidepressant. The mechanism of action of antidepressants is related to the monoamine theory, which suggests depression is caused by low levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine. Of the options provided, only (C) inhibits the uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, leading to increased levels in the synaptic cleft and improved mood, but also may cause ECG changes due to the drug's cardiotoxic effects."

The symptoms suggest a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, and the medication prescribed is likely an antidepressant.
