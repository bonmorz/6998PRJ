The recent travel to Brazil and lack of control measures for mosquito bites increase the likelihood. Malaria may lead to similar symptoms, but there is no mention of a positive blood smear nor is there any history of previous cases of malaria in the region. Chagas disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever are less likely causes given the absence of key symptoms such as organomegaly or a characteristic rash."
