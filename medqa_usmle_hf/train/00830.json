The boy's behavior of being defiant and oppositional towards authority figures, but getting along with peers and being helpful at home, are consistent with a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. Antisocial personality disorder typically involves a pattern of behavior of disregarding and violating the rights of others. Attention deficit disorder may cause difficulty with attention and hyperactivity, but typically does not involve oppositional behavior. Separation anxiety disorder involves excessive anxiety in response to separation from attachment figures."

The fact that he gets along with his peers and is helpful at home suggests that it is not Antisocial Personality Disorder. Attention Deficit Disorder may cause some similar behavior, but the refusal to participate in gym class suggests it is not the primary diagnosis. Separation Anxiety Disorder is characterized by excessive fear or anxiety about separation from home or attachment figures, and does not fit the symptoms described."

The disruptive behavior, refusal to comply with authority figures, and lack of problems with peers suggest Oppositional Defiant Disorder. Antisocial personality disorder is more common in adolescence and adulthood, and involves more serious and persistent behavior issues. Attention deficit disorder could be a contributing factor but does not fully explain the behavior. Separation Anxiety Disorder is not applicable to this scenario as there is no mention of anxiety or fear of separation."

This disorder involves a persistent pattern of disobedience and defiance towards authority figures, without the presence of serious violations of the rights of others. The behavior is often seen in multiple settings and affects the child's functioning. Antisocial personality disorder requires evidence of conduct disorder before the age of 15 and the presence of serious violations of the rights of others. Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) involves symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interfere with functioning, and Separation Anxiety Disorder involves excessive anxiety when separating from attachment figures. Neither ADD nor Separation Anxiety Disorder fit the symptoms described in the case."
