When the body is deprived of water, the kidneys will decrease urine volume to conserve water, resulting in decreased urine volume. Urine osmolarity will increase in response to dehydration as the body tries to concentrate urine, leading to increased urine osmolarity. Free water clearance will also decrease as the body tries to conserve water, and ADH (antidiuretic hormone) will be increased to increase the reabsorption of water and maintain water balance. Therefore, the best answer is (D)."

This means decreased urine volume, increased urine osmolarity (more concentrated), and decreased free water clearance (less water being excreted). The body will also increase the production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) to further conserve water. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer."

When the body is deprived of water, the urine volume will decrease and the urine osmolarity will increase, indicating that the body is trying to conserve water. However, the free water clearance will also decrease, meaning that the body is becoming more and more dehydrated. The elevated levels of ADH will also help the body to conserve water. Therefore, the best answer is (D), where both the urine volume and osmolarity are decreased, but the free water clearance is also decreased, and ADH is increased to try to conserve water."
