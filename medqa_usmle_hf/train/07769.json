Points are given for certain factors, and a total score is calculated. Based on the total score, patients are classified as low (0-2 points), moderate (3-4 points), or high (5-6 points) risk of mortality. In this scenario, we are assuming all other relevant factors are negative, so we only consider the initial points. The patient has a serum glucose greater than 200 mg/dL, AST greater than 250 IU/L, and leukocytes greater than 18,000 per mL, which adds up to 3 points. This puts the patient at a moderate risk of mortality with an overall risk of 15%."
