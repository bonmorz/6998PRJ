The patient's presentation is consistent with giant cell arteritis (GCA), based on her age, new-onset headache, jaw claudication, polymyalgia rheumatica, and visual field defect. The laboratory results showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), which are common markers of inflammation in GCA. Prednisolone is the standard treatment for GCA and is most beneficial for this patient. Low-molecular weight heparin is indicated for deep vein thrombosis, which the patient has a history of, but is not the best option for her current symptoms. Gabapentin is used to treat neuropathic pain and is not indicated in this case. Methotrexate is used for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, but it is not useful for GCA."
