The hepatitis B vaccination history suggests that the patient may have had successful vaccination, so nothing further needs to be done for hepatitis B. The bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine is used to prevent tuberculosis and is not recommended for this patient. The yellow fever vaccine is not recommended for individuals with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm3."
