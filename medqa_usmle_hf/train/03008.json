The addition of a heavy baby to the data set will increase the mean weight, but it will not affect the median, as it is an extreme outlier and does not fall in the middle of the distribution. The mode, which is the most common weight, will also not change, as there are already 7 infants with the same weight as the mode.

Since the mean, median, and mode were all 7 lbs 2 oz before the addition, the current total weight of the 37 newborns is 37 * 7.125 = 263.625 lbs. After adding the 10 lbs 2 oz baby, the total weight becomes 273.625 lbs. Dividing by 38 (the new sample size) gives a new mean weight of 7.2026 lbs, which is slightly higher. Since the median is not affected by extreme values, it will stay the same at 7 lbs 2 oz. The mode, which was previously 7 lbs 2 oz, will also stay the same since no other weight value was added more than 7 times. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that the mean will increase, but the median and mode will stay the same. Answer choice (C) is the correct choice."

The median is the middle value in the data set, and the addition of one new weight will not affect the position of the middle value. As a result, the median will remain the same.
