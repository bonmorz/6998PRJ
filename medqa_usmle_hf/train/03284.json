The next best step in management would be to perform an open thoracotomy to surgically address the bleeding and remove the clot. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Clamping the chest tube is not recommended, as it can lead to tension pneumothorax. Placing the chest tube to water seal may help prevent air from entering the pleural space, but it would not address the ongoing bleeding. Similarly, removing the chest tube would not address the underlying bleeding and would likely lead to recurrence of the hemothorax. Therefore, the best option to address ongoing bleeding and ensure adequate drainage is to perform an open thoracotomy."
