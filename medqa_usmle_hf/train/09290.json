Juvenile idiopathic arthritis presents with joint pain and swelling and can also have systemic features, but the skin rash and gastrointestinal involvement are not typical. Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome can also present with skin rash and gastrointestinal symptoms, but the joint involvement and positive occult blood test suggest a different diagnosis."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest the most likely diagnosis is leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which includes abdominal pain, non-blanching skin rash, joint swelling, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Familial Mediterranean fever causes recurrent fever and abdominal pain, but usually without joint involvement or skin rash. Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome usually presents with a widespread rash, fever, and organ involvement. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis may present with joint involvement but typically does not involve the skin or gastrointestinal tract. The laboratory values are consistent with the diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, as the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate is a common finding."
