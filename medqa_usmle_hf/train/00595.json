The elevated levels of bilirubin, AST, and ALT also indicate liver damage. The patient\u2019s positive results for HBsAg, anti-HBc, and HBeAg suggest an active chronic hepatitis B infection. Option A is incorrect because the patient has elevated liver enzyme levels and clinical symptoms. Option B is incorrect because the patient\u2019s positive results for HBsAg and HBeAg indicate a chronic infection rather than an acute infection. Option D is less likely because the patient\u2019s symptoms are not specific to alcohol-related liver disease."
