Activation of this receptor leads to the activation of phospholipase C (option C), which in turn leads to an increase in intracellular calcium levels and smooth muscle contraction. By blocking this pathway, tamsulosin relaxes the smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder neck, relieving the symptoms of BPH. Option A, B, and D are not directly related to the mechanism of action of tamsulosin."

Tamsulosin is an alpha-blocker that relaxes smooth muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, relieving symptoms of BPH. It works by inhibiting the activity of alpha-1 receptors, and alpha-1 receptors are associated with G proteins and Phospholipase C. Therefore, the most likely change in intracellular messaging is a decrease in the activity of Phospholipase C. Answer (C) is correct."
