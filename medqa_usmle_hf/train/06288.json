Among the options, only the afferent limb of the gag reflex, which is mediated by the glossopharyngeal nerve, innervates the parotid gland, hence it is the correct answer. Protrusion of the tongue is controlled by the hypoglossal nerve, afferent limb of the cough reflex is mediated by the vagus nerve, and equilibrium and balance are regulated by the vestibulocochlear nerve."
