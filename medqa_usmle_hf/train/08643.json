The fact that he has had similar lesions in the past and has not had any genital or anal lesions also supports this diagnosis. Pemphigus vulgaris and oral thrush are less likely because they usually have different symptoms and presentation. Herpangina may cause similar symptoms but usually occurs in younger children and is associated with fever and sore throat, which are not present in this case."
