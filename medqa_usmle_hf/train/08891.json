This suggests a mechanical obstruction, which could have been caused by iatrogenic injury near the suspensory ligaments during the hysterectomy. The other options are less likely causes, as they do not involve physical obstruction of the bladder. Prerenal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis are both conditions that can result from decreased kidney perfusion, which is not a likely complication of this surgery. Cervical cancer would not cause an acute obstruction of the bladder."

Prerenal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis are not likely the cause since the patient\u2019s vital signs and laboratory results are stable.
