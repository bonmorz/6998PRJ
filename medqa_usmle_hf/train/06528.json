The sudden onset of symptoms after 24 hours of improvement in cellulitis suggests that there is a new cause for the symptoms. Nausea, abdominal pain, mydriasis, and piloerection are classic signs of opioid withdrawal, which could suggest that the patient is chronically using opioids. Option A is unlikely given the improvement in cellulitis and option B is unlikely given that there were no signs of allergic reaction previously. Option D is possible but less likely given the sudden onset of symptoms."
