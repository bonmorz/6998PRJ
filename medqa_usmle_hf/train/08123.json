The symptoms are usually ipsilateral (on the same side as the lesion) loss of tactile, vibration, and proprioception sensation, and contralateral (on the opposite side of the lesion) loss of pain and temperature sensation. There is also ipsilateral paresis, or weakness. Therefore, the answer is (A), which includes right-sided tactile, vibration, and proprioception loss (ipsilateral), left-sided pain and temperature sensation loss (contralateral), and right-sided paresis (ipsilateral)."
