Therefore, the preferred treatment for this patient is hemodialysis with frequent monitoring of his potassium level. During dialysis, the patient might experience hypertriglyceridemia, which is an increase in blood triglyceride levels due to the sudden removal of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins during dialysis. This can be managed with dietary changes and medication. Options A, B, and D are not commonly associated with dialysis but can occur with other treatments or conditions."
