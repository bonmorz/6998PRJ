Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker that decreases blood pressure, decreases contractility of the heart, and decreases heart rate. However, it can increase end-diastolic volume due to decreased contractility, which leads to decreased ejection of blood from the ventricles. Therefore, the correct answer is (D)."

Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker and will decrease contractility and heart rate, leading to decreased stroke volume and end-diastolic volume. However, it can cause vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure, which is opposite to the answer choice. Therefore, the correct answer is (D), which shows an increase in end-diastolic volume, a decrease in blood pressure, a decrease in contractility, and a decrease in heart rate. The decrease in contractility and heart rate can be beneficial for the patient as it reduces the workload on the heart, while the increase in end-diastolic volume can increase cardiac output."
