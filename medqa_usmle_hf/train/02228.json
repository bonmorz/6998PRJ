The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest that he may have Marfan syndrome, which is associated with the cardiac abnormalities seen on electrocardiography and coronary angiography. One of the defining features of Marfan syndrome is downward lens subluxation, while Macroorchidism is a feature of Fragile X syndrome. Saccular cerebral aneurysms and ascending aortic aneurysm can also occur in Marfan syndrome but are not as closely associated with the clinical presentation in this case."
