The patient\u2019s symptoms are suggestive of puberty and the timing of the onset of vaginal bleeding is consistent with menarche. The non-focal abdominal and pelvic exam suggest no emergent issue, thus reassurance and discharge with education on menstrual hygiene and follow up for regular menses is the best and most appropriate next step. Ordering a coagulation profile or performing a hysteroscopy and biopsy are not necessary management options for a patient experiencing menarche. Administering antibiotics is not indicated as there is no evidence of an infection."

The best next step is reassurance and discharge, with instructions to return if the symptoms persist or worsen."
