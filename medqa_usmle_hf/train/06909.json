The patient\u2019s symptoms and labs suggest the development of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, likely caused by the long-term use of prednisone. Bilateral adrenal atrophy is expected in this case, as chronic exogenous steroid use can lead to adrenal suppression and atrophy. Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia is seen in primary adrenal hyperplasia, which is not likely in this case with normal serum ACTH levels. Unilateral adrenal atrophy or hyperplasia is less likely as symptoms affect both sides of the body."
