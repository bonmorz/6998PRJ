Testicular enlargement is a reliable indicator of pubertal development and should occur by age 14 years. Linear growth acceleration should occur by age 13 years, but absence of it alone would not be enough to diagnose delayed puberty. Presence of gynecomastia at age 15 years would suggest early puberty. The adult type of pubic hair distribution should occur by age 17-18 years, so absence of it alone would not be enough to diagnose delayed puberty. Therefore, the absence of testicular enlargement by age 14 years is the most reliable indicator of delayed puberty."
