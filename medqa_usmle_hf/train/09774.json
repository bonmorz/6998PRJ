Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic, and adding it to the patient's drug regimen could increase the risk of hyperkalemia, especially in patients with renal insufficiency. Gynecomastia is a possible side effect of spironolactone, but hyperkalemia is a more significant concern in this patient. Azotemia refers to an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, which can indicate renal impairment, but it is not specifically associated with spironolactone. Alkalosis refers to a high pH level in the blood and is not a likely complication of this drug."
