The lab results also show hypercalcemia, which is a common finding in malignancies such as lung, breast, kidney, and prostate cancer.

The unintentional weight loss, cough, and elevated calcium levels are indicative of cancer. The normal electrolytes, kidney function, and normal Quantiferon-gold test suggest that the cancer is not affecting those organs. The low PTH and 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D levels suggest a paraneoplastic syndrome called hypercalcemia of malignancy, which is commonly seen in patients with cancer. The smoking history is a risk factor for cancer as well."
