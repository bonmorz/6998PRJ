Penicillin works by binding to and inhibiting the activity of the bacterial enzyme transpeptidase, which is involved in the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. The molecular structure that penicillin mimics is D-alanine-D-alanine, which is a component of the peptidoglycan cell wall. Therefore, the answer is (A) D-Ala-D-Ala."
