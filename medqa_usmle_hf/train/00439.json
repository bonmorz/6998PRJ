Sphincterotomy, the division of the sphincter muscle, is the definitive treatment for this condition. Pancreaticoduodenectomy and surgical revascularization are not indicated in this case, and a biliary stent may provide temporary relief but would not address the underlying dysfunction of the sphincter muscle."
