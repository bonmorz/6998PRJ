Elevated fasting serum gastrin is a characteristic finding in MEN1-associated Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and it can be further confirmed by an increase in gastrin secretion with secretin administration.

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is caused by gastrin-secreting tumors in the pancreas or upper small intestine. The correct answer would be elevated fasting serum gastrin that increases with secretin administration, as this is characteristic of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Secretin stimulates gastrin secretion, and in this condition, there will be an exaggerated response to it. The other options are not consistent with this diagnosis."

Option (C) is incorrect because cholecystokinin should not affect gastrin levels. Option (A) may be seen in a patient with ulcer but not in a patient with gastrinoma."

Option A is incorrect because fasting serum gastrin levels are expected to be elevated in gastrinomas. Option B is incorrect because secretin administration will not cause a decrease in gastrin levels in gastrinoma patients. Option C is incorrect because cholecystokinin administration is not used in diagnostic testing for gastrinomas."
