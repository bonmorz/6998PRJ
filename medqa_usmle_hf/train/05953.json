The presence of PAS-positive globules in hepatocytes suggests glycogen accumulation, which is seen in glycogen storage diseases. The low levels of the protein responsible for recoil of the lungs during expiration suggests alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a type of glycogen storage disease. This protein is an alpha-1 protease inhibitor, which maintains the elastic properties of lung tissue by inhibiting proteolytic enzymes that degrade elastin. Since the protein is a polypeptide, the correct process that contributes to its elastic properties is its arrangement in a triple helical structure, not oxidative deamination of lysine residues (A), formation of disulfide bridges (C), or N-glycosylation of serine residues (D)."

The fact that there are PAS-positive globules in periportal hepatocytes suggests that the patient had alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a genetic disorder that affects the liver and lungs. The protein responsible for the recoil of the lungs during expiration is alpha-1 antitrypsin, which is primarily composed of amino acids. The elastic properties of this protein are due to the presence of lysine residues, which undergo oxidative deamination to form desmosine and isodesmosine, which in turn form cross-links that provide elasticity to the protein. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) oxidative deamination of lysine residues."
