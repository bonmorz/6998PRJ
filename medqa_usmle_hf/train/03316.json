The symptoms of acute painful, red, and swollen toe suggest gout, and HCTZ can increase uric acid levels in the body which can contribute to the development of gout. The medication started in the question is most likely colchicine, which inhibits microtubule polymerization and decreases inflammatory response. Nausea and vomiting are common side effects of colchicine. All other options are medications used to treat gout, but they do not have the same mechanism of action as colchicine."
