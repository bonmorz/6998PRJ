A case-control study would be the most appropriate study design to investigate the association between anti-NMDA encephalitis and ovarian teratomas.

This design would allow for the calculation of odds ratios to better understand the strength of the association between the two conditions."

In this type of study, patients with the disease (cases) and patients without the disease (controls) are compared to determine if there is a significant association between the disease and a potential risk factor (in this case, ovarian teratomas). A retrospective cohort study would be appropriate to evaluate the outcome of patients with anti-NMDA encephalitis who have undergone treatment, but it would not be the most appropriate study design for identifying the association with ovarian teratomas. A randomized controlled trial would not be appropriate in this case as it involves introducing a treatment or intervention, and it is not the main objective of the study. Lastly, a case series would not be appropriate as it involves simply reporting on a group of patients with similar characteristics, without a control group for comparison."
