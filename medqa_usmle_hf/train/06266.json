Carcinoma in situ refers to a stage of cancer where abnormal cells are found in the outermost layer of skin, but have not yet invaded deeper tissues or spread to other parts of the body. Histopathological features associated with carcinoma in situ include irreversible nuclear changes in the stratum basale, which is the deepest layer of the epidermis. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. Pleomorphism of cells in the stratum corneum is associated with squamous cell carcinoma, and the presence of epithelial cells in the dermis is associated with invasive carcinoma. The increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio in the stratum spinosum is not specific to any one type of cancer."
