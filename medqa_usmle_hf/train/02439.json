The patient's symptoms of flushing and stinging sensation suggest that the cause of the reaction is likely due to niacin-induced prostaglandin release. Allergic reactions typically involve more systemic symptoms, such as respiratory difficulty and rhinorrhea. Drug overdose is unlikely as the patient takes only two medications at recommended doses. Serotonin syndrome would cause more severe symptoms such as hyperreflexia, agitation, and fever. Anxiety can cause flushing but would not explain the stinging sensation on the face."

The patient's flushed appearance and stinging sensation on the face are consistent with a flush reaction caused by prostaglandin release. This can be a side effect of niacin and can be prevented by taking aspirin 30 minutes prior to dosing. The absence of respiratory difficulty and rhinorrhea or epiphora suggests that the symptoms are not caused by an allergic reaction or serotonin syndrome, and there is no indication of drug overdose. The patient's history also does not suggest anxiety as the cause of her symptoms."

Given the patient's recent start on niacin and lack of previous allergies, it can be hypothesized that her symptoms were caused by a release of prostaglandins in response to niacin. The lack of respiratory difficulty and absence of other symptoms, as well as the resolution of symptoms over time, make a drug overdose or serotonin-related reaction less likely. Anxiety may exacerbate symptoms but is unlikely to be the primary etiology."
