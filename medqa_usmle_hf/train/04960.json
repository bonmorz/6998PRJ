Reticulocyte counts increase in response to anemia, so option A is incorrect. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are expected to be low after acute blood loss, but option B specifically targets hemoglobin levels, so it is incorrect. Option C is incorrect because hematocrit is a measure of the percentage of red blood cells in the blood, and a low hematocrit indicates anemia, which is expected after acute blood loss."

Hemoglobin levels are expected to be low after acute blood loss, but this does not necessarily mean that they will remain low. Hematocrit is also expected to be low after acute blood loss. Normocytic anemia is the most likely result of acute blood loss."
