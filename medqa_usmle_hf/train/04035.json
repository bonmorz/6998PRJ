The symptoms and physical examination suggest that further imaging is necessary to evaluate for any underlying pathology. Ultrasound is simple and non-invasive and can help identify any underlying mass or ductal dilation. Image-guided biopsy or nipple discharge cytology can be done if the ultrasound is abnormal, but they are more invasive and pose some risk of complications. Reassurance may be appropriate for benign causes, but further evaluation is needed in this case."
