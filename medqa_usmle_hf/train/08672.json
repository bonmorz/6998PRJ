The patient\u2019s symptoms, laboratory results, and family history suggest the presence of peptic ulcer disease and potential gastrointestinal bleeding. The positive fecal occult blood test supports this. None of the options listed relate to gastrointestinal issues. As such, option (D) Pituitary adenoma is the most likely answer as it can lead to elevated calcium levels and constipation. However, further evaluation is needed to confirm the suspected diagnosis."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a possible peptic ulcer disease, but the positive fecal occult blood test raises concern for gastrointestinal bleeding. The laboratory results do not suggest any abnormalities in calcium, phosphorus, or thyroid hormone levels, which rules out options (B) and (C). Pheochromocytoma would present with hypertension and symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, and headache. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms and positive fecal occult blood test is gastrointestinal bleeding, but a pituitary adenoma should also be considered as it can cause constipation and urinary frequency. Further evaluation is necessary, such as a colonoscopy to identify the source of bleeding and imaging studies to evaluate for a pituitary adenoma."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, family history, and laboratory results suggest a possible diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is caused by a pituitary adenoma that produces gastrin. This excess of gastrin causes increased acid secretion leading to peptic ulcers. The fecal occult blood test suggests possible gastrointestinal bleeding, which is a complication of peptic ulcers. None of the other options are related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results."
