The purpose of the table is to evaluate the success of randomization in creating comparable groups with regard to relevant factors. This is important in ensuring that any observed differences in outcomes between the two groups can be attributed to the intervention being studied (annual mammograms starting at age 40 or 50) rather than other factors. Option A, statistical power, refers to the ability of the study to detect a significant difference between the two groups if one actually exists. Observer bias (option B) refers to systematic errors that can occur if those collecting or interpreting data have preconceived notions or beliefs that influence their actions. Confounding (option C) refers to the presence of other factors that may influence the outcome being studied, making it difficult to isolate the effect of the intervention being studied."

Answer (B) refers to potential biases introduced by the researcher, which is not relevant to this table. Answer (C) is also related to confounding, but it refers to factors that are not controlled for in the study and can influence the outcomes.

The table helps to establish whether the randomization was successful in achieving balance between the groups. Confounding refers to the presence of factors that could affect the outcome and that are not equally distributed between the groups. Observer bias refers to bias that can occur when the outcome assessor knows which group the patient is in.
