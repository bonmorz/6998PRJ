The Rinne test suggests conductive hearing loss, which can be caused by otitis media. However, given the history of living in Flint, Michigan, which has a history of lead contamination in their water supply, the most likely cause of the hearing loss is lead exposure. The next best step would be to remove and prevent the child from exposure to the source of lead. Blood transfusion and chelation therapy are not indicated at this time as the patient's hemoglobin and lead levels are not critically low. Treatment for hookworm is not indicated based on the patient's history and physical examination findings."
