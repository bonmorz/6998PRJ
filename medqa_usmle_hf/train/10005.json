Vitamin D deficiency and ectopic hormone production are other possible causes, but the absence of any other findings related to those conditions make hypoparathyroidism the most likely cause. Albright hereditary osteodystrophy is associated with hypoparathyroidism but has additional symptoms such as short stature and obesity, which are not present in this case."
