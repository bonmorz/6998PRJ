The physician should explore the reasons behind the children's request and attempt to address their concerns while also advocating for the patient's right to know their own medical information.

Delivering the information in Spanish may be helpful if the patient does not speak English, but it does not address the ethical concerns in the situation. Simply respecting the children's wishes to hold prognosis information may not be the best course of action without exploring the reasons behind their request. It is important to explain your obligation to tell the father, but it is also important to understand the context of the situation before disclosing any information."
