A hormone released from atrial myocytes is most likely atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which acts to decrease sodium reabsorption at the collecting tubules, leading to increased excretion of sodium and water. This mechanism helps to reduce blood volume and lower blood pressure, which would be helpful in treating congestive heart failure. The positive correlation between left atrial pressures and ANP levels suggests that ANP is released in response to increased atrial pressure, likely as a compensatory mechanism to help reduce fluid volume."
