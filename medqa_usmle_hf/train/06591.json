The symptoms indicate a congenital heart defect with an imperforate muscular septum between the right atrium and right ventricle, which would cause a left-to-right shunt and increased pulmonary blood flow. Thus, (A) is incorrect. The holosystolic murmur indicates ventricular septal defect. The electrocardiogram would show left-axis deviation as the left ventricle hypertrophies due to increased workload. Elfin facies and delta wave on ECG are associated with Williams syndrome and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, respectively, which are not related to the patient's condition."

Increased pulmonary vascular markings on chest x-ray can be seen in pulmonary hypertension, but no information is given to support this diagnosis.
