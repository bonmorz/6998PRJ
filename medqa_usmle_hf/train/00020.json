The symptoms and signs, such as tenderness to palpation along the lower spine, weakness in the bilateral lower extremities, left greater than right, hyporeflexia in the knee and ankle jerks bilaterally, and saddle anesthesia, are consistent with cauda equina syndrome. Steroids should be started prior to MRI to decrease inflammation and prevent further damage while waiting for definitive treatment. Rushing to radiation is not the appropriate next step without further diagnostic evaluation. Conus medullaris syndrome is less likely given the distribution of symptoms."
