The patient is presenting with symptoms of heart failure, including dyspnea on exertion, bilateral lower leg edema, and an S3. The systolic murmur suggests there may be mitral regurgitation, which can contribute to heart failure symptoms. Bisoprolol and lisinopril are already being used to manage his heart failure, but adding hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate can help to improve symptoms further. Amlodipine and valsartan are not typically used as first-line treatments for heart failure."

Hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate is a recommended add-on therapy for patients with chronic heart failure symptoms who are already on a standard therapy.
