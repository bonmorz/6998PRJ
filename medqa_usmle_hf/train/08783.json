Among the options, apixaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) that inhibits factor Xa and is commonly used for the treatment and prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Elevated PT and PTT values suggest that the patient is receiving an anticoagulant and the normal platelet count rules out heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which is a rare but serious complication of unfractionated heparin use. Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent that is used for acute ischemic stroke and massive pulmonary embolism and is not typically used for deep vein thrombosis. Low molecular weight heparin is another common anticoagulant but would not cause the abnormal lab values seen in this patient."

The patient's presentation suggests a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a drug was prescribed to inhibit the coagulation cascade. The laboratory studies show prolongation of partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time, which are affected by Unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin. However, the thrombin time is normal, which rules out the use of heparins. Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent that breaks down clots, but it's not indicated in this scenario. Apixaban is an anticoagulant that directly inhibits factor Xa and is used in the treatment and prevention of DVT, so it's the most likely drug that was prescribed."
