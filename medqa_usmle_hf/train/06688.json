The urine osmolality in the proximal convoluted tubule and distal convoluted tubule should be around 300 mOsmol/kg, but in dehydration, the body is trying to conserve water and make urine more concentrated, so the osmolality in the loop of Henle, ascending limb, and collecting duct is higher. Psychogenic polydipsia leads to low urine osmolality, furosemide overdose leads to low urine osmolality in the loop of Henle and collecting duct, and diabetes insipidus leads to low urine osmolality in the collecting duct."

The proximal tubule reabsorbs most of the ultrafiltrate, resulting in a low osmolality. The ascending limb of the loop of Henle is impermeable to water, resulting in a high osmolality, while the descending limb is permeable to water, resulting in a low osmolality. The distal convoluted tubule is where aldosterone acts to promote sodium reabsorption, resulting in a low osmolality. The collecting duct is where antidiuretic hormone acts to promote water reabsorption, resulting in a high osmolality. Overall, the high osmolalities in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and the collecting duct suggest that this individual is trying to conserve water in response to dehydration."

The urine osmolalities in different parts of the nephron of the human subject suggest that the individual is experiencing dehydration. The proximal convoluted tubule should have an osmolality of around 300 mOsmol/kg and the collecting duct should have an osmolality of around 1200 mOsmol/kg in response to antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is released in response to dehydration to conserve water. Loop of Henle, descending limb, and distal convoluted tubule typically have low osmolalities. Psychogenic polydipsia would have low osmolalities throughout the nephron due to excessive water intake.

Psychogenic polydipsia would lead to low urine osmolality values, as the individual drinks excess fluids.
