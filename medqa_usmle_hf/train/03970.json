The high level of renin and low level of aldosterone suggest congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which is commonly caused by a deficiency in certain enzymes involved in the synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone. In this case, the high level of 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) suggests 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the most common form of CAH. DOC is a precursor of aldosterone and can act as a mineralocorticoid, leading to hypertension. The increased concentration of sex hormones and decreased amount of cortisol are also characteristic of 21-hydroxylase deficiency."

Ambiguous genitalia and high levels of sex hormones suggest a congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which can cause an increase in DOC production.

Option A is also incorrect because although high levels of sex hormones are present, they would not directly cause hypertension."
