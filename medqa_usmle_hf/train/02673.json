The fact that there are old hemorrhages in bilateral occipital lobes raises suspicion for amyloid angiopathy, which is a risk factor for cerebral hemorrhage. Ruptured vascular malformation and hypertensive encephalopathy can also cause cerebral hemorrhage, but the presence of old hemorrhages in the occipital lobes specifically suggests amyloid angiopathy. Cardiac embolism is less likely in this case as there is no reported history of atrial fibrillation or valvular disease."
