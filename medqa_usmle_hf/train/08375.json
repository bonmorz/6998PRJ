The patient\u2019s stress and diet consciousness suggest that he may be taking steroids to enhance his training. Heat from friction may cause sperm to die but it is not the most likely cause in this case. Anorexia nervosa can cause hormonal imbalances that affect fertility but the patient\u2019s history and physical examination do not suggest this. Kallmann syndrome is a genetic condition that affects puberty and fertility, but the patient\u2019s age of onset for puberty (13 years) suggests that this is not the cause."
