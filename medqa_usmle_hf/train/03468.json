Increased activity of an isoform of elastase that is normally inhibited by alpha-1-antitrypsin suggests alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic risk factor for COPD. Leukotriene B4 is a potent chemoattractant that can stimulate inflammation in the lung tissue, leading to the production of elastase and destruction of lung tissue in patients with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Lactoferrin is an antimicrobial agent that is not directly involved in inflammation. Interferon gamma and thromboxane A2 also play roles in inflammation, but they are not specifically associated with COPD or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency."
