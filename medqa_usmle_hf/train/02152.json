The patient's cholesterol levels have improved with the current dose of simvastatin, but the high creatine kinase levels and generalized weakness suggest medication-induced myopathy. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to discontinue simvastatin and start an alternative statin, such as pravastatin, in 3 weeks. Option (B) is not recommended due to the risk of worsening myopathy with niacin. Option (C) is not recommended as fenofibrate has no significant effect on LDL-cholesterol levels. Option (D) is not recommended due to the risk of worsening myopathy with a higher dose of simvastatin."
