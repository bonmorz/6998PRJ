This pattern is most commonly seen with the use of short-acting nitrates, such as the transdermal nitroglycerin patch used in option A. The constant exposure to nitrates may lead to the development of tolerance, which can explain the return of symptoms after 48 hours despite continued use. The other options involve either regular-release or extended-release formulations, which are less likely to cause rapid tolerance development."
