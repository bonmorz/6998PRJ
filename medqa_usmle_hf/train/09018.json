Let's assume that changing the cut-off level to 2 mg/uL increases sensitivity to 0.97 while decreasing specificity to 0.96. Then the new table looks like:\n\n             Test Positive     Test Negative\nCondition+ TP (sensitivity = 0.97) FN\nCondition- FP TN (specificity = 0.96)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C)."

Using the formulae for changes in sensitivity and specificity, we get the following:\nNew sensitivity = sensitivity + (1-sensitivity) x (true positive rate at new cut-off - true positive rate at previous cut-off)\n= 0.92 + (1-0.92) x (0.97 - 0.82) = 0.97 or 97%\nNew specificity = specificity + (1-specificity) x (true negative rate at new cut-off - true negative rate at previous cut-off)\n= 0.97 + (1-0.97) x (0.92 - 0.84) = 0.96 or 96%\nTherefore, the answer is (C) - Sensitivity = 97%, specificity = 96%."
