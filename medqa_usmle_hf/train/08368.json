Option (A) is a part of the management of AMI, but aspirin 81 mg is not strong enough for this patient's condition. Option (B) is not recommended because pre-hospital thrombolysis has not shown to be superior to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in treating AMI. Option (D) is not sufficient for treating AMI, and the patient's low blood pressure indicates that caution is needed when administering additional nitroglycerin. Therefore, option (C) is the best choice as it includes administering a higher dose of aspirin and transporting the patient to a PCI center for more advanced treatment."

Nitroglycerin can be used for symptom relief but PCI is the definitive treatment. Option A is incorrect because 81 mg is a very low dose for aspirin in an acute setting. Option B is incorrect because pre-hospital thrombolysis has limited indications and is associated with a high risk of adverse events."
