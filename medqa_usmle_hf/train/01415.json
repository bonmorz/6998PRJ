Chlamydia trachomatis is a bacteria that causes sexually transmitted infections, and the first-line treatment is typically a macrolide antibiotic such as azithromycin. Azithromycin inhibits the 50S ribosome subunit, which ultimately prevents bacterial protein synthesis and replication, leading to bacterial death. Disrupting peptidoglycan cross-linking is a mechanism of action for beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin. Inhibiting DNA gyrase is a mechanism of action for fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin. Inhibiting transpeptidase and cell wall synthesis is a mechanism of action for beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin."
