The wound described is a chronic non-healing wound, and the fact that it is soft and painless suggests that granulation tissue has formed. Granulation tissue is mainly composed of type III collagen. Type I collagen is rather found in mature scar tissue. Epithelial cell migration is an early step in wound healing, but it is not relevant to a chronic non-healing wound. Neutrophil migration into the wound is an early step in acute wound healing and is not expected in a chronic non-healing wound."
