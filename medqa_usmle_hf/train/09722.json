The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, weight loss, and multiple tender palpable masses that track along the lower extremities, suggest the possibility of malignancy, specifically metastatic disease, which warrants a CT scan of the abdomen to investigate the cause of the patient's symptoms. Colonoscopy is unlikely to be helpful in this case as the patient's symptoms do not suggest a primary colon malignancy. CT scan of the chest may be indicated if there is suspicion of a pulmonary metastasis, but the palpable masses suggest a lower extremity issue. A lower extremity ultrasound may be a more specific test, but it may not provide enough information to investigate the cause of the patient's systemic symptoms. Thus, CT scan of the abdomen is the best next step in management."
