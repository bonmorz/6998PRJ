The massive active bleeding from the rectum with negative nasogastric aspirate suggests lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Colonoscopy is a diagnostic option, but because of the large amount of blood loss and the hemodynamic compromise, mesenteric angiography should be performed first to identify a possible source of bleeding that can be treated with embolization. Exploratory laparotomy is not indicated because the source of bleeding is not clear, and EGD only evaluates the upper GI tract."

The nasogastric tube draining bile suggests that the bleeding is likely from the lower gastrointestinal tract. Mesenteric angiography is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis as it can identify the bleeding site and allow for possible embolization. Colonoscopy can also be used to visualize the colon, but it may not be effective in identifying the bleeding site if the bleeding is proximal to the cecum. Exploratory laparotomy is a more invasive option and is considered after other options have been exhausted. EGD is not useful in identifying lower gastrointestinal bleeding."
