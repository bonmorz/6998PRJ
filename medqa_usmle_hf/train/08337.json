The patient\u2019s symptoms are suggestive of sleep apnea, which is commonly associated with obesity and a large neck circumference. Obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder that causes a person to stop breathing for short periods of time while they sleep, leading to daytime fatigue and difficulty concentrating. Chronic fatigue syndrome is a possibility, but given the patient\u2019s other symptoms and physical exam findings, obstructive sleep apnea is the most likely cause."
