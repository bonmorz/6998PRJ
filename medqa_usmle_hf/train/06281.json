The most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms is Liddle syndrome, which causes persistent sodium reabsorption in the kidneys leading to hypokalemia, hypertension, and metabolic alkalosis. Amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic, can inhibit the sodium channels in the distal nephron, leading to increased potassium secretion and decreased sodium reabsorption. This can effectively treat the symptoms of Liddle syndrome. Loop diuretics, mannitol, and thiazide diuretics are not usually used to treat Liddle syndrome."
