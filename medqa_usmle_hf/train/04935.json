The child developed a fever and seizure 13 days after receiving multiple vaccinations, but workup was normal and she has had no new symptoms. The most likely explanation for this is a febrile seizure, which can occur after vaccinations, and is not a reason to delay or alter future vaccinations. Administering prophylactic aspirin or a reduced-dose vaccine is not appropriate or necessary. Refraining from administration of the DTaP vaccine puts the child at risk for highly contagious and potentially deadly diseases.

The most likely cause of the fever and seizure is a febrile seizure, which is a known side effect of vaccines. Refraining from administration of the DTaP vaccine would leave the child vulnerable to pertussis, diphtheria, and tetanus. Administration of the DTaP vaccine with prophylactic aspirin is not recommended because aspirin has been associated with an increased risk of Reye syndrome in children with febrile illnesses. Administration of a reduced-dose DTaP vaccine is not necessary because the child has already received three doses and is up-to-date on vaccinations. Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation is administration of the DTaP vaccine as scheduled. The child\u2019s mother should be reassured that the risk of febrile seizures after vaccination is low and the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks."
