The most appropriate drug in this case is one that activates antithrombin III, as it is a natural inhibitor of coagulation factors and has been shown to be effective in preventing and treating deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase is used to prevent blood clotting in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy, but it is not appropriate for acute treatment of pulmonary embolism. Inhibition of adenosine diphosphate receptors and activation of plasminogen are also not appropriate as they do not directly target the underlying pathology of thrombus formation."
