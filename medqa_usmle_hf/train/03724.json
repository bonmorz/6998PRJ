The family history of malignancy, bilateral leukocoria, and inflammation suggest that this patient may have retinoblastoma, a cancer of the retina. Retinoblastoma is caused by mutations in the RB1 gene, which regulates the G1-S checkpoint in the cell cycle. Loss of function of RB1 can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and the development of tumors. Therefore, the process affected in this patient is regulation of the G1-S transition. DNA mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, and stem cell self-renewal are all unrelated to the development of retinoblastoma."

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Regulation of the G1-S transition.
