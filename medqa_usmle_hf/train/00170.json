Reassurance would be the most appropriate initial step before exploring other treatment options. Sleep restriction involves limiting the amount of time spent in bed, which may not be appropriate for this patient\u2019s current sleep duration. Flurazepam is a sedative that may help the patient fall asleep faster, but it can also cause next-day sedation and impair cognitive function. Paradoxical intention involves intentionally trying to stay awake, which may not be appropriate for this patient\u2019s anxiety levels."
