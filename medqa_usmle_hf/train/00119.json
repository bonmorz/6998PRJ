The presence of a new holosystolic murmur further supports this diagnosis. The fact that she has been on warfarin and has a large conjunctival hemorrhage in her left eye indicates she is prone to bleeding, making it less likely that her symptoms are due to pulmonary metastases. Streptococcus sanguinis and Cardiobacterium hominis are both potential causes of infective endocarditis, but Enterococcus faecalis is the most common cause, especially in patients with a history of urinary tract infections."
