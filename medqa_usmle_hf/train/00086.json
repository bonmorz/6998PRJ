The patient had a near-total thyroidectomy, and the sudden stiffness and tingling in the hand on inflation of the blood pressure cuff, along with the low serum calcium, suggest hypoparathyroidism. Therefore, the next best step is to check the serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. This will confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. CT scan with pancreatic protocol is not relevant to the current presentation. Serum vitamin D level and 24-hour urinary calcium may be helpful in the long term, but they are not urgent in this acute situation."
