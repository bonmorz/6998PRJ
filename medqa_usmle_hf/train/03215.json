The symptoms and the likely organism suggest enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), which produces heat-stable toxin. This toxin activates adenylate cyclase, increasing the level of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and resulting in increased chloride secretion and water efflux in the intestines, leading to diarrhea. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate."

Heat-stable toxins are known to cause an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which leads to hypersecretion of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen, resulting in watery diarrhea. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate."

The symptoms and the likely causative organism suggest that the patient has been infected with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), which produces the heat-stable toxin. This toxin leads to increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which activates ion transport in the intestinal epithelium, causing watery diarrhea. Option (A) is incorrect because heat-stable toxin does not affect cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels. Option (B) is incorrect because there is no direct effect on calcium levels. Option (C) is incorrect because heat-stable toxin increases cyclic guanosine monophosphate, not cyclic adenosine monophosphate."
