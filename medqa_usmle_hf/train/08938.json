The patient is presenting with symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis, as seen from the high glucose level, ketones in the urine, and metabolic acidosis. Regular insulin is the appropriate management for diabetic ketoacidosis, which should be administered intravenously. Potassium chloride may also be given but only after ensuring that serum potassium concentration is known and renal function is assured, as hyperkalemia is a risk with insulin administration. Cefazolin is an antibiotic, which is not indicated in this case. Insulin detemir is a long-acting insulin used in the management of diabetes, but it is not appropriate for treating acute diabetic ketoacidosis."
