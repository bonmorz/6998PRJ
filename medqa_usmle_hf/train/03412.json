The patient has acute herpes zoster, indicated by the painful stripe of vesicular lesions and the absence of lesions, bruising or trauma. The laboratory tests show elevated BUN and serum creatinine and urinary protein, which suggest underlying kidney disease. Cardiac catheterization is not indicated as the electrocardiogram is normal and there are no signs of cardiac involvement. Ganciclovir is used for cytomegalovirus infection, which is not likely in this case. Rest and NSAIDs may provide some relief for the chest pain, but they do not treat the underlying herpes zoster. Famciclovir is a medication used to treat herpes zoster, and is the best course of treatment for this patient."
