The laboratory results show elevated levels of 17OH-progesterone and androstenedione, which are consistent with 21\u03b2-hydroxylase deficiency. This condition leads to increased levels of androgens, causing symptoms like acne and early pubic hair growth. The other options are less likely to be the cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms."

The patient has severe acne, early onset of pubic hair growth, and laboratory results suggest 21\u03b2-hydroxylase deficiency, which is a common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

Leydig-cell tumor production of androgens is a possibility but less likely given the patient\u2019s age and other symptoms. Constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase and 17\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiencies are not associated with androgen excess."

The patient's symptoms suggest hyperandrogenism, and the lab results show elevated levels of 17OH-Progesterone and Androstenedione, indicating an adrenal enzyme deficiency. Among the options, 21\u03b2-hydroxylase deficiency is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Leydig-cell tumor production of androgens is less likely as the patient's hormones are elevated across the board, not just androgens. Constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase and 17\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency would result in different biochemical profiles."
