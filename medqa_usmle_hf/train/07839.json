The AST:ALT ratio is typically greater than 2:1 in alcoholic liver disease. \u00df-hydroxybutyrate is increased in ketosis, which is generally not seen in alcoholic liver disease.

The patient presents with hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice, suggesting alcohol-induced liver disease. With heavy alcohol intake, the liver will preferentially metabolize alcohol over fatty acids, leading to fatty liver.
