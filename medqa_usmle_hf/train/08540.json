The new strands are synthesized in a 5' to 3' direction, meaning that new nucleotides are added to the 3' end of the growing strand. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 5' --> 3'. Option A is the direction of proofreading activity by DNA polymerase, not the direction of new strand synthesis. Options C and D refer to protein synthesis, not DNA replication."
