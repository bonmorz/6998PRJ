Focal nodular hyperplasia generally presents without symptoms and does not have a well-defined mass. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a possibility, but the patient's young age and lack of risk factors make it less likely. Metastatic disease is less likely given the patient's negative serology for viral hepatitis and lack of history of other cancers."
