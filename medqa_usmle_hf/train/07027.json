The patient's symptoms suggest postpartum endometritis, which is commonly caused by polymicrobial infection, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Thus, the next best step in management would be a combination regimen of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as intravenous clindamycin and gentamicin treatment. Choice A is not the immediate management of postpartum endometritis. Choice C is not recommended because intravenous cefotetan has limited coverage against gram-negative bacteria. Choice D is not recommended because it is only prophylactic treatment and cannot treat an already established infection."
