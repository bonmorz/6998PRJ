Behavioral training is a common treatment for urge incontinence. Overflow incontinence is characterized by a frequent dribbling of urine due to an overfull bladder that doesn't empty completely, while stress incontinence is characterized by leakage of urine with activities such as coughing, sneezing or laughing.

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest urge incontinence, which is characterized by a sudden and strong urge to urinate followed by involuntary leakage of urine. Behavioral training is often used to improve bladder control in patients with urge incontinence. Stress incontinence is characterized by leakage of urine during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing or sneezing. Overflow incontinence is characterized by continuous or intermittent leakage of urine due to an inability to completely empty the bladder. Total incontinence is the constant leakage of urine due to a structural or neurological problem that prevents the bladder from holding urine. The normal urinalysis result suggests that there is no underlying infection or inflammation causing the symptoms."

The patient's symptoms of frequent need to void, inability to reach the bathroom in time, and urinary leakage suggest a diagnosis of urge incontinence, which is characterized by sudden urge to urinate with urgency and involuntary loss of urine. Overflow incontinence is associated with incomplete emptying of the bladder, leading to continuous or intermittent leakage of urine. Stress incontinence occurs with increased intra-abdominal pressure, such as during coughing or sneezing, and is more common in women who have had multiple pregnancies or pelvic surgeries. Total incontinence involves continuous leakage of urine and is often caused by a fistula or birth defect."
