The ECG shows ST segment depression and T wave inversion, which suggest a decrease in left ventricular preload, leading to reduced oxygen supply to the heart and worsening of symptoms. Impaired pulmonary artery outflow is seen in pulmonary hypertension, which is not the diagnosis in this case. Decreased impulse conduction across the AV node would manifest as heart block and not cause worsening shortness of breath. Increased systemic vascular resistance can lead to hypertension but not acute exacerbation of symptoms in this case."

The progression of symptoms and the ST segment depression suggest decreased left ventricular preload, which can be caused by worsening aortic stenosis.

Decreased impulse conduction across the AV node is also unlikely to be the cause of exacerbation of symptoms."

The ECG shows ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion, which can be due to decreased left ventricular preload (option B) causing myocardial ischemia.

Option A, impaired pulmonary artery outflow, is not typically associated with exacerbation of symptoms in aortic stenosis. Option C, decreased impulse conduction across the AV node, would not typically cause symptoms in aortic stenosis. Option D, increased systemic vascular resistance, may affect blood pressure but is not typically associated with exacerbation of symptoms in aortic stenosis."
