The decreased radial and brachial pulses and cooler skin on the right upper extremity suggest that there is reduced blood flow to the right arm. The patient's history of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, which can result in vertebral artery occlusion. Medications are unlikely to cause these specific symptoms. Compression of neurovascular structures in the neck may also cause these symptoms, but the decreased pulses suggest occlusion of a blood vessel rather than compression. Infarction of the middle cerebral artery would present with different neurological symptoms."

The symptoms suggest positional vertebrobasilar insufficiency, which can be caused by reversed blood flow in the right vertebral artery. The decreased pulses and cooler skin over the right upper extremity suggest decreased blood flow in the subclavian artery, which can be caused by compression of neurovascular structures in the neck. However, the symptoms of lightheadedness and nausea with juice improving symptoms suggest cardiovascular cause rather than a neurological cause or adverse effect of medications. Infarction of the middle cerebral artery does not explain the symptoms in this case."

Compression of neurovascular structures in the neck could also cause similar symptoms, but the decreased pulses and cooler skin suggest a vascular cause.

Compression of neurovascular structures in the neck is also a possible cause, but is less likely given the location and nature of the symptoms.

The symptoms of intermittent heaviness and paresthesia of the right arm, lightheadedness, nausea and blurred vision suggest intermittent reduced blood flow to the right arm and brain. The decreased radial and brachial pulses on the right upper extremity, and cooler skin suggest obstruction of the right subclavian artery. Since the symptoms resolve after drinking some juice, it suggests a drop in blood sugar level, which is not a possible adverse effect of the current medications. Compression of neurovascular structures in the neck can cause similar symptoms but it would not cause unequal pulses and cooler skin. Infarction of the middle cerebral artery would cause symptoms that are not localized to the right arm.
