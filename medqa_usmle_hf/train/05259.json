The patient's sexual history, perianal pain during defecation, perineal heaviness, discharge, and bleeding during defecation all suggest anal cancer. The edematous verrucous anal folds that are hard and painful to the touch and the presence of an anal canal ulcer with well defined, indurated borders on a white background support this diagnosis. Biopsy results will confirm the diagnosis. Anal fissure is typically a tear in the anal tissue, while proctitis is inflammation of the rectum and polyps are abnormal growths in the colon or rectum and not likely to cause symptoms in the anal area."

The physical exam findings of edematous verrucous anal folds and proctosigmoidoscopy findings of a well-defined ulcer on a white background with indurated borders further support the diagnosis of anal cancer. Biopsy results will confirm the diagnosis. Anal fissures can cause pain and bleeding during defecation but are not associated with discharge or perineal heaviness.

The physical examination and proctosigmoidoscopy findings support the diagnosis of anal cancer. The pending biopsy results will confirm the diagnosis. Anal fissure, proctitis, and polyps may also present with similar symptoms, but the history and physical examination findings in this case suggest anal cancer is the most likely diagnosis."
