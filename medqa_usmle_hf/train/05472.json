Patients undergoing splenectomy are at increased risk of infections with encapsulated organisms due to functional asplenia. Vaccination against these organisms is recommended at least 2 weeks prior to surgery, followed by a 5-year course of penicillin prophylaxis starting at the time of surgery. It is important to note that the exact timing and duration of prophylaxis may vary depending on individual patient factors and should be discussed with the treating physician. Option B is the correct answer."
