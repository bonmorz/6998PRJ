The patient has hyperkalemia which means that adding furosemide, a loop diuretic, may worsen the problem by decreasing potassium excretion.

Sevelamer is not appropriate since the patient's serum phosphate is not elevated. Patiromer is a potassium binder that can help lower serum potassium levels, so it is the best strategy for managing the patient's hyperkalemia."
