The patient presents with altered mental status and extremely high blood glucose levels, suggesting hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). The initial treatment for HHS includes fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Therefore, the best initial step in management is to administer lactated Ringer's solution. Option (A) is incorrect because 3% hypertonic saline is used for severe hyponatremia, which is not the case in this patient. Option (C) is incorrect because glargine insulin is a long-acting insulin and is not indicated for the treatment of HHS. Option (D) is incorrect because regular insulin and potassium can be used in the treatment of HHS, but fluid resuscitation should be the first step."

The best initial step in management is to administer fluids to correct for dehydration and improve electrolyte balance. Lactated Ringer's solution is preferred over normal saline as it more closely matches the electrolyte composition of extracellular fluid. Regular insulin and potassium will also be given, but after fluid resuscitation. 3% hypertonic saline is not recommended as it has a risk of causing osmotic demyelination syndrome.

The patient has a severely elevated glucose level and is likely experiencing hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), which can lead to altered mental status. The initial step in management should be to rehydrate the patient with intravenous fluids such as lactated Ringer's solution. Option A (3% hypertonic saline) is not the initial treatment for HHS, but may be used if the patient's sodium level remains low despite fluid administration. Option C (glargine insulin) is not appropriate as it is a long-acting insulin and will not quickly reduce the glucose level. Option D (regular insulin and potassium) is a possible treatment, but fluids should be given first to rehydrate the patient and lower the glucose level before starting insulin therapy."
