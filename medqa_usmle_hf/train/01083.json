Bell's Palsy involves facial nerve paralysis, and painless ulcerated papules may suggest syphilis infection, but the most likely sign or symptom present in this patient based on the given information is loss of vibration sensation. The negative Romberg sign indicates that the patient's proprioception is intact."
