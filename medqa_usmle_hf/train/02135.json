The most appropriate next step for management would be to write a medical note that excuses the patient from sports and other strenuous activities until he has recovered. Oral amoxicillin therapy is not indicated for viral infections and could even cause a rash in patients with infectious mononucleosis. Oral corticosteroids and intravenous acyclovir are also not indicated."
