The patient's history suggests syncope and the best next step is to conduct a head-up tilt-table test to evaluate the autonomic reflex responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms. This test assesses the response of the cardiovascular system to a change in position from lying to standing, which can help determine if the loss of consciousness was due to a vasovagal reaction. Holter monitoring would be more appropriate if the patient had symptoms of arrhythmia. Echocardiography may be useful in assessing the underlying cardiac structure but would not be the best initial test. Dix-Hallpike maneuver is used to diagnose benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and is not indicated in this case."
