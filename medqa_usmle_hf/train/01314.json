The pulsatile abdominal mass felt on deep palpation further supports this diagnosis. The bruit in the epigastric region indicates a possible AAA. The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness can be attributed to the expanding aneurysm. Lab values are within the reference range and do not suggest any other diagnosis. Acute pancreatitis, acute gastritis, and diverticulitis would have different clinical presentations and laboratory abnormalities."
