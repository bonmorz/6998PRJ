The empty glenoid fossa and palpation of the humeral head below the coracoid process confirm this diagnosis. The most appropriate next step in management is to test sensation of the lateral shoulder to ensure that there is no nerve damage. Closed reduction should then be performed to return the humeral head to the glenoid fossa. Neer impingement test and drop arm test are not appropriate for this situation."
