The patient presents with symptoms of acute limb ischemia and has decreased pulses in the left leg, suggesting a possible arterial occlusion. Digital subtraction angiography is the most definitive test to confirm the diagnosis by directly visualizing the arteries and any blockages. Creatine kinase concentration is not useful in this scenario, as it would be elevated in muscle damage such as rhabdomyolysis, but this is not the main concern. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a screening test that can be used to diagnose peripheral artery disease, but it may not provide enough information in this acute scenario. Compartment pressures are measured in cases of compartment syndrome, which is not the primary concern in this case."

Ankle-brachial index is a noninvasive test for PAD, but it may be falsely elevated in patients with calcified arteries or falsely low in patients with diabetes or arterial wall stiffness, so it may not be as reliable in this patient. Compartment pressures may be useful in diagnosing compartment syndrome, but this is not the most likely diagnosis given the presentation."
