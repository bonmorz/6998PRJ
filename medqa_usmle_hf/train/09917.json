Leucine and valine are essential amino acids that are often restricted in patients with mitochondrial disorders, as they can contribute to elevated levels of toxic metabolites. Therefore, increasing leucine in the patient's diet may be helpful. Alanine is already elevated in the patient's serum, and increasing it in the diet may exacerbate the problem. Asparagine and methionine are not directly related to mitochondrial disorders."

Elevated lactate levels and elevated alanine and pyruvate suggest a defect in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which is involved in the breakdown of glucose for energy.
