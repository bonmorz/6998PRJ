The most common primary immunodeficiency associated with recurrent pyogenic infections and chronic diarrhea is common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). CVID is characterized by low levels of immunoglobulins, especially IgA and IgG, and increased levels of IgM. Therefore, the most likely profile to be observed in this patient is increased IgM and decreased IgA, IgG, and IgE (option A)."
