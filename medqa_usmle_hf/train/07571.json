The question is asking about the characteristics of the immune response triggered by B-cell-alone-substances compared to those that require T-cells. The answer is (C) Requires mitogens, as the substances that stimulate B-cells alone may act as mitogens and stimulate the proliferation of B-cells without the need for T-cell help. The other options, such as producing memory and affinity maturation, typically require T-cell help. The requirement for a peptide antigen is not specific enough to differentiate between the two types of substances."

The question is asking about the differences in immune response between substances that require T-cells and those that stimulate B-cells alone. Option C is correct, as substances that require T-cells often need mitogens to stimulate cell proliferation and division, while those that stimulate B-cells alone do not require this. Options A and B are incorrect, as both types of substances can produce memory and affinity maturation. Option D is also incorrect, as both types of substances can be either peptide antigens or non-peptide antigens."

The question describes two types of substances that promote antibody production in B-cells, one requiring T-cells and one not. The question asks about the characteristics of the immune response triggered by the B-cell-alone-substances compared to those that require T-cells. As per the answer choices, it can be noted that memory and affinity maturation are not dependent on T-cells, as both are features of the adaptive immune response. Mitogens, on the other hand, are substances that promote cell division and are often used in laboratory settings to stimulate immune cell proliferation. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) - the immune response triggered by B-cell-alone-substances may require mitogens to promote proliferation and antibody production, whereas those that require T-cells may not."

The correct answer is (C), which states that the immune response triggered by these substances requires mitogens. This makes sense, as mitogens are substances that stimulate cell division and proliferation, and are often used to activate immune cells in vitro. The other answer choices are incorrect because they describe characteristics of a typical immune response, which requires the interaction and collaboration of multiple types of immune cells, including T-cells, B-cells, and antigen-presenting cells. Producing memory, undergoing affinity maturation, and requiring a peptide antigen are all hallmarks of a classic immune response, but do not necessarily apply to the specific scenario described in the question."

Therefore, the immune response triggered by these substances may not result in memory or affinity maturation, and may not necessarily require a peptide antigen."
