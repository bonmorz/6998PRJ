The description of decreased muscle tone and low fasting serum glucose concentration suggest a possible defect in the carnitine shuttle, which is responsible for transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria for energy production. \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate is a ketone body produced during prolonged fasting, which suggests that the patient is relying on fat metabolism rather than glucose metabolism for energy. This supports the suspicion of a defect in the carnitine shuttle. The other options (alanine aminotransferase, uric acid, creatine kinase) are not specific enough to raise suspicion of a different diagnosis."
