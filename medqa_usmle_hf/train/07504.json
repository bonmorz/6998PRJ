The ascending limb of the loop of Henle is impermeable to water, allowing for the active reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and potassium ions. This leads to a dilution of the urine and a lower osmolality compared to the descending limb. Therefore, the correct answer is option (D) impermeability to water. Increased transcription of water channels (option A) would lead to increased water reabsorption and a higher urine osmolality. Impermeability to sodium (option B) would lead to a higher concentration of sodium in the urine and a higher osmolality. Increased bicarbonate reabsorption (option C) would not directly affect urine osmolality."

The ascending limb of the loop of Henle is impermeable to water, which means that urine in this part of the nephron will not be concentrated.
