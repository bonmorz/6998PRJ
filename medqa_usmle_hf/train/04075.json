The difference between atrial and ventricular rates is due to temporary inactivation of Na+ channels in the AV node, which causes the AV node to conduct fewer impulses than it receives from the atria. This result in some atrial impulses being blocked, and a lower ventricular rate than the atrial rate. The other options are not related to this specific mechanism."

The difference between atrial and ventricular rates is due to temporary inactivation of Na+ channels in the AV node, leading to irregular conduction of electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles. Option B is incorrect because inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump would affect cardiac muscle contraction, not conduction. Option C is incorrect because limited speed of conduction through the left bundle branch would not affect conduction from the atria to the ventricles. Option D is incorrect because prolonged influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the bundle of His is not a known mechanism for atrial fibrillation."
