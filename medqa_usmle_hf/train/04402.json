The normal ristocetin cofactor assay makes Bernard-Soulier disease unlikely. The lack of complementation with mixing tests with factor IX and XI makes Hemophilia B unlikely. Glanzmann thrombasthenia would not improve with mixing with factor VIII. Hemophilia A is the most likely diagnosis, supported by the reversal of coagulation abnormality with mixing with factor VIII."

Based on the clinical presentation and the coagulation panel, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Hemophilia A. Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder that affects clotting factor VIII. The patient's prolonged PTT, which is corrected with factor VIII mixing, is suggestive of a deficiency in this clotting factor. The other options, Bernard-Soulier disease and Glanzmann thrombasthenia, affect platelet function rather than clotting factors, and Hemophilia B affects factor IX rather than factor VIII."
