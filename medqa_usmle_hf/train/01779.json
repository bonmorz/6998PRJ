Option A is incorrect because skin flushing and pruritus are side effects of niacin, not fibrates. Option C is incorrect because there is no evidence suggesting that fibrates increase the risk of cataracts. Option D is incorrect because fibrates act by activating PPAR-\u03b1, which leads to increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased triglyceride synthesis. The correct answer is B because fibrates can potentiate the risk of myositis when given with statins."

Option A is incorrect as skin flushing and pruritus are side effects of niacin, not fibrates. Option C is also incorrect as there is no known association between fibrates and cataracts. Option D is incorrect as the correct answer is actually option B - fibrates can potentiate the risk of myositis (muscle inflammation) when given with statins, which can lead to rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown) and other serious complications. Therefore, it is important to monitor patients closely if they are receiving both medications."

Option A is false, as skin flushing and pruritus are side effects of niacin, not fibrates. Option C is also false, as there is no evidence of an increased risk of cataracts with fibrate use. Option D is false, as fibrates work by activating PPAR-alpha, which leads to increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased triglyceride synthesis. Option B is true, as fibrates can potentiate the risk of myositis when given with statins, which can lead to muscle breakdown and kidney damage. This is due to the fact that both drugs have the potential to cause myopathy, and combining them can increase the risk. Therefore, fibrates should be used with caution in patients taking statins."
