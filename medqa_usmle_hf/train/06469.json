Mathematically, PPV = true positives / (true positives + false positives). In this case, we have 400 true positives (patients with NHL who tested positive) and 0 false positives (none of the control patients tested positive). Therefore, PPV = 400 / (400 + 0) = 1.0, or 100%. This means that if a patient tests positive for this novel blood test, there is a 100% chance that they have NHL. However, it is important to note that this does not mean that the test has a sensitivity or specificity of 100%, as those are other important factors to consider when evaluating a diagnostic test."
