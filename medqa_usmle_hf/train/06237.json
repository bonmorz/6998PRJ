The lack of complaints, unremarkable laboratory workup, and the fact that the patient's height is below the third percentile suggest constitutional growth delay, which is a common cause of delayed puberty and growth spurt in boys. Familial short stature is not associated with delayed puberty, celiac disease may cause growth failure but is usually accompanied by other symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, and growth hormone deficiency usually presents with more severe growth failure and other symptoms such as weight loss and fatigue."

The patient's bone age being determined to be 11 years suggests that the growth plates are still open and there is potential for growth. The normal laboratory workup, along with the patient's otherwise healthy appearance and lack of complaints, suggests that there is no underlying medical condition causing the growth delay. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is constitutional growth delay, which is a temporary delay in puberty that results in later-than-normal growth spurt and catch-up growth."

The lack of symptoms and unremarkable TSH levels suggest constitutional growth delay, which is a temporary delay in growth that resolves spontaneously. Familial short stature would be more consistent with a decreased growth rate that occurs continuously throughout childhood, rather than a sudden stall in growth. Celiac disease can cause growth delay, but it is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. Growth hormone deficiency would have lower levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)."
