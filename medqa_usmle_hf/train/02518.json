The blue-spotted skin rash is likely due to neonatal tetanus, which is common in rural areas with lack of prenatal care and vaccinations. The finding of a continuous murmur over the left upper sternal border is most consistent with a patent ductus arteriosus. Neonatal tetanus and patent ductus arteriosus are both associated with rural and low-resource settings but are not directly related."
