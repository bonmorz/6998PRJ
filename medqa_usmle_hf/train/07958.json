Ulnar nerve lesions typically cause numbness and weakness in the hand, but not limited mobility of specific digits.

This is a condition in which the connective tissue in the palm of the hand thickens and forms nodules, causing the fingers to slowly curl inward. Family history and smoking are risk factors for this condition, and metformin is not known to cause this condition. Ganglion cyst can cause pain and swelling, but it is not typically associated with limited mobility of the fingers. Ulnar nerve lesion and tenosynovitis can also cause limited finger mobility, but they would not present with skin puckering and nodules."

The symptoms and physical examination findings are classic for palmar fibromatosis, also known as Dupuytren's contracture. It is a condition where the palmar fascia thickens and forms nodules, which can lead to limited joint mobility. It is commonly seen in patients with a family history, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and those with a history of manual work or smoking. Ganglion cysts usually occur over joints and are not associated with limited joint mobility. Ulnar nerve lesions typically cause weakness or numbness in the affected hand. Tenosynovitis may cause tenderness, swelling, and pain over the affected tendons but do not cause limited joint mobility."
