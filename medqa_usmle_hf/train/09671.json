Among the options, only (C) is a valid reason, since benzodiazepines have a higher risk of tolerance and dependence. Zolpidem, on the other hand, has a lower risk of these adverse effects. Option (A) is incorrect, as zolpidem does bind to the GABA receptor. Option (B) is also incorrect, as zolpidem has a rapid onset of action. Option (D) is incorrect, as zolpidem is not typically used as a muscle relaxant."
