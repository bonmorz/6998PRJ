The patient presents with a gunshot wound to the thigh and diminished pedal pulse on the right side, which suggests arterial injury. The most appropriate next step in management would be duplex ultrasonography to evaluate for arterial injury as it is a non-invasive option that can assess blood flow to the leg and help guide further management. Wound cleaning and tetanus toxoid are standard procedures for any wound, and fasciotomy is indicated if there is a suspected or confirmed compartment syndrome. Digital subtraction angiography is an invasive procedure and is not the first line of management for suspected arterial injury."

The patient has sustained a gunshot wound to the right thigh and has a diminished pedal pulse on the right side compared to the left, which suggests possible vascular injury. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform a Duplex ultrasonography to assess for arterial or venous injury. Wound cleaning and tetanus toxoid should be done initially, but are not the most appropriate next step given the possibility of vascular injury. Fasciotomy may be necessary if there is evidence of compartment syndrome, but is not indicated before further evaluation. Digital subtraction angiography may also be useful, but is less commonly used than Duplex ultrasonography."
