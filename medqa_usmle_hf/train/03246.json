The initial step in the development of male characteristics is the activation of SRY (sex-determining region on the Y chromosome) gene, which is responsible for encoding a protein that triggers the development of testes. The testes then produce testosterone which is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that is responsible for the development of male genitalia. Formation of the genital ridge and paramesonephric duct are involved in the development of both male and female genitalia."

The initial step in the development of male characteristics is the expression and function of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome, which triggers the differentiation of the gonads into testes and the production of testosterone. Conversion of testosterone to DHT occurs later in development and is responsible for the development of external male genitalia. Formation of the genital ridge precedes the development of both male and female reproductive organs, while formation of the paramesonephric duct is involved in the development of female reproductive organs. Since the patient has an XY genotype but no development of external male genitalia, it is possible that there was a mutation or issue in the SRY gene."
