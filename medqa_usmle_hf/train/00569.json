Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be intubation and mechanical ventilation to protect the airway and support respiratory function. Insertion of a nasogastric tube and enteral nutrition, intravenous antibiotic therapy, and intravenous corticosteroid therapy may be necessary at some point during treatment but are not the most urgent steps to take in this scenario."
