The patient's symptoms and culture results suggest a staphylococcal infection, which is commonly associated with protein A on the bacterial surface. However, the presence of erythema and warmth of the knee suggest that the bacteria are also producing exopolysaccharides, which are a major virulence factor that contribute to the biofilm formation and immune evasion by the bacteria. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) exopolysaccharides. Vi capsule is produced by Salmonella typhi and is important for its virulence in causing typhoid fever, and cord factor is produced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is important for its virulence in causing tuberculosis."
