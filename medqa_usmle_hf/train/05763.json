The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which puts him at risk for transient ischemic attack (TIA). The normal neurological examination suggests that the effects of TIA have resolved. Carotid doppler ultrasound shows mild stenosis in both carotid arteries, so carotid endarterectomy is not indicated at this time. Transthoracic echocardiogram is not indicated as the patient has no cardiac abnormalities. Intravenous alteplase therapy is not indicated because the patient's symptoms have already resolved and the CT scan of the head is normal. Antiplatelet therapy is the most appropriate next step in management to prevent future TIA or stroke."
