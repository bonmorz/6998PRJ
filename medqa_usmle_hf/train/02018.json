The patient\u2019s medical history is significant for hypertension and congestive heart failure, which require medication management. This suggests that checking the patient\u2019s medication profile is the best initial step for management, as some medications can cause heart block. Observation and repeat ECG if symptoms recur may be appropriate if the medication profile does not suggest a cause. Temporary cardiac pacing may be needed if the patient is symptomatic or develops a dangerously slow heart rate. External defibrillation is not indicated in this case."
