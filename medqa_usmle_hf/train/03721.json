The drug that acts centrally as an \u03b12-adrenergic agonist is likely clonidine, which can decrease sympathetic outflow and blood pressure. The mechanism of action involves the activation of \u03b12-adrenergic receptors in the brain and subsequent inhibition of adenylate cyclase, which leads to a decrease in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and ultimately results in decreased sympathetic activity."
