The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a diagnosis of leprosy, which is a chronic infectious disease that primarily affects the skin and peripheral nerves. The hypopigmented macules and loss of sensation are characteristic findings of leprosy. The patient\u2019s work on a farm and contact with animals may have increased his risk of contracting the disease. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is characterized by skin sores that do not involve peripheral nerves. Tinea corporis is a fungal infection that typically affects non-hairy skin. Scrofula is a swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck and is not associated with the symptoms described in this case."

The presence of erythematous macules and papules on the face, arms, chest, and back, as well as thinning of the eyebrows and loss of some eyelashes, is also characteristic of Leprosy. Cutaneous leishmaniasis usually presents as ulcerative skin lesions, while Tinea corporis presents as circular, scaly patches. Scrofula refers to an enlargement of the cervical lymph nodes."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including pruritic rash, numbness and tingling sensation, hypopigmented macules, and loss of eyebrows and eyelashes, are suggestive of leprosy. Leprosy is caused by Mycobacterium leprae, which affects the peripheral nervous system, resulting in sensory loss and motor weakness. The patient\u2019s occupation as a rice farmer and livestock caretaker also puts him at risk for exposure to M. leprae. Cutaneous leishmaniasis usually presents with ulcerative skin lesions, while tinea corporis is a fungal infection and does not cause sensory or motor deficits.
