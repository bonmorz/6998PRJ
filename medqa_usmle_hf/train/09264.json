In iron deficiency anemia, both serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are typically low, so option A is incorrect. Option C is also incorrect because in iron deficiency anemia, the reticulocyte count is usually low. Hemoglobin A2 is not affected in iron deficiency anemia, so option D is also incorrect. TIBC, on the other hand, is typically high in iron deficiency anemia, as the body tries to increase iron uptake to compensate for the deficiency. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."

One of the causes of iron-deficiency anemia is decreased iron absorption, which would lead to an increase in total iron binding capacity (TIBC). Transferrin saturation would be decreased in this case. Reticulocyte count may be elevated in cases of anemia, but it would not be the most likely additional finding. Hemoglobin A2 measurement is used to diagnose hemoglobinopathies such as beta-thalassemia and would not be elevated in iron-deficiency anemia."
