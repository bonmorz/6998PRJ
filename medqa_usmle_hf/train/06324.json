The patient has a known history of aortic valve replacement and a systolic ejection click is heard, suggesting a mechanical valve.

Echocardiography may be ordered in the future to assess valve function, but it is not necessary for this specific preoperative clearance. Nitrous oxide may be used during the procedure, and discontinuing aspirin and warfarin may put the patient at risk for thrombosis."
