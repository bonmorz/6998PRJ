RAG1 and RAG2 are responsible for the process of V(D)J recombination, which is important for the production of antigen receptors on B and T cells. Knocking out these genes will result in a total lack of B and T cells, as they will not be able to properly undergo V(D)J recombination and mature. Option A is unlikely because NADPH oxidase is involved in the respiratory burst, which is a separate process from V(D)J recombination. Option C is also unlikely because CD18 is a subunit of several different leukocyte integrins and is not directly related to B and T cell development. Option D is incorrect because the absence of B and T cells will result in a severe immunodeficiency and susceptibility to infections, which would not be asymptomatic."
