The symptoms suggest a transfusion reaction, and among the options, preformed antibodies are the most likely mechanism for this patient's condition. These antibodies can lead to intravascular hemolysis, resulting in fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and oozing at the IV sites. Deposition of immune complexes and T lymphocyte reactions can also cause transfusion reactions, but they typically occur hours to days after transfusion. Production of leukotrienes is not a typical mechanism for transfusion reactions."
