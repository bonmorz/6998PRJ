The symptoms, especially the severe left upper abdominal pain and left shoulder pain, suggest that the patient has experienced a splenic rupture. Significantly elevated levels of basophilic nuclear remnants (Howell-Jolly bodies) may be seen in the peripheral blood smear after a splenic rupture due to loss of splenic function. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) basophilic nuclear remnants."

Therefore, the most likely finding on a peripheral blood smear in this patient after recovery would be basophilic nuclear remnants."

Exquisite tenderness to palpation over the left 8th, 9th, and 10th ribs as well as rebound tenderness in the abdomen further supports this. Splenic rupture can cause basophilic nuclear remnants (Howell-Jolly bodies) to be found on a peripheral blood smear. Basophilic stippling can be seen in lead poisoning and erythrocytes lacking central pallor can be seen in conditions such as sickle cell anemia, but these are not likely to be seen in this patient. Erythrocyte fragments (schistocytes) can be seen in conditions such as hemolytic anemia or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, but there is no indication that the patient has either of these conditions."

This is supported by the left upper abdominal pain and left shoulder pain, as well as the tenderness to palpation over the left ribs and rebound tenderness in the abdomen. Treatment involves stabilizing the patient and performing surgery to address any damage to the spleen. Afterwards, it is likely that basophilic nuclear remnants will be found on a peripheral blood smear, as the spleen is responsible for filtering out old or damaged red blood cells and removing their nuclei. This process is impaired when the spleen is injured or removed, leading to an increase in basophilic nuclear remnants. Option (B) is incorrect as erythrocyte fragments, or schistocytes, are typically found in conditions such as hemolytic anemia or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Option (C) is incorrect as erythrocytes lacking central pallor, or spherocytes, are typically found in conditions such as hereditary spherocytosis. Option (D) is incorrect as basophilic stippling is typically found in conditions such as lead poisoning."
