Among the options, dobutamine is the only medication that targets beta-1 adrenergic receptors preferentially over beta-2 adrenergic receptors, making it the most likely medication to have been prescribed for acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Its efficacy decreases within one week due to receptor down-regulation, which is why the physician explained that it would only be used temporarily. Epinephrine activates both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors, while isoproterenol activates both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors as well as alpha adrenergic receptors, making them less suitable for this patient's condition. Norepinephrine primarily activates alpha adrenergic receptors so it is also an unlikely option."
