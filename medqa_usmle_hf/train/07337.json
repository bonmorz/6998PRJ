As a result, the levels of these markers do not match the expected levels based on the gestational age of the fetus. Other options, such as Robertsonian translocation or maternal hypothyroidism, would not cause abnormal levels of these specific markers. Gestational trophoblastic disease would result in abnormal levels of beta human chorionic gonadotropin, but not \u03b1-fetoprotein."
