The hormone detected in the patient\u2019s urine to detect pregnancy is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is produced by the placenta after conception. It maintains the corpus luteum during early pregnancy, which then secretes progesterone to support the endometrial lining and prevent menstrual shedding. This hormone also stimulates fetal angiogenesis and growth, but does not directly cause hypertrophy of the uterine myometrium or stimulate uterine contractions at term."

The hormone that was measured in the patient\u2019s urine to detect pregnancy is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which maintains the corpus luteum during the first trimester of pregnancy.

Hypertrophy of the uterine myometrium and stimulation of uterine contractions at term are primarily driven by estrogen and progesterone. Fetal angiogenesis is stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF), rather than hCG."
