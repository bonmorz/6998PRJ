The flat facial profile, small eyes, prominent epicanthal folds, and single transverse crease in the palms are all common features of Down syndrome. The vomiting and constipation may be due to intestinal obstruction, a common complication in these patients. The abdominal radiograph may show signs of obstruction as seen in the picture. Genomic imprinting is the differential expression of genetic material depending on whether it is inherited from the mother or father. Anticipation refers to the phenomenon where certain genetic disorders exhibit earlier onset and more severe symptoms in successive generations. Monosomy refers to the presence of only one copy of a particular chromosome, whereas Down syndrome is characterized by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21."

Genomic imprinting refers to the selective expression of a gene depending on whether it is inherited from the father or mother. Anticipation refers to a phenomenon in certain genetic disorders where the severity of symptoms increases as the disease is passed down through generations. Monosomy is the presence of only one chromosome instead of a pair, which is rare in humans and is usually fatal in early embryonic development."

The physical and clinical features (flat facial profile, small eyes, epicanthal folds, single transverse crease on palms, distended abdomen with high-pitched bowel sounds, greenish-yellow vomiting, and no stool since leaving the hospital) suggest Down syndrome, which is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (having an extra copy of chromosome 21).

The greenish-yellow fluid vomited by the infant suggests a possible obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract, which is consistent with the distended abdomen and high-pitched bowel sounds observed on examination. The abdominal radiograph confirms the presence of an intestinal obstruction. Therefore, the best explanation for the physical and clinical features exhibited by this infant is Trisomy."
