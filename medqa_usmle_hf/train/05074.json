Thiocyanate is used to treat hyperthyroidism, including Graves' disease, by inhibiting the uptake of iodine by the follicular cells in the thyroid gland. This reduces the production of thyroid hormones, which are elevated in hyperthyroidism. Inhibition of 5'-deiodinase and thyroid deiodinase enzyme activity would actually increase thyroid hormone levels, and inhibiting beta-adrenergic receptors would not have a direct effect on thyroid hormone production."

Thiocyanate is used to decrease the amount of iodine available for thyroid hormone synthesis by inhibiting iodide follicular uptake. This can help to reduce the symptoms of hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' disease. Options A and B refer to the inhibition of enzymes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, but they do not directly target the symptoms of Graves' disease. Option C refers to the inhibition of beta-adrenergic receptors, which is a different approach to treating hyperthyroidism."
