Insulinomas are the most common pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and can cause hypoglycemia. Sulfonylurea use, NIPHS, and primary adrenal insufficiency are less likely given the patient\u2019s history and lab values."

The patient\u2019s high plasma insulin levels and C-peptide suggest endogenous insulin secretion, ruling out sulfonylurea use. The normal \u00df-hydroxybutyrate and the absence of symptoms for a pituitary or adrenal gland dysfunction rule out primary adrenal insufficiency. The fact that the patient has a milky discharge from both breasts suggests a pituitary adenoma, which could be secreting prolactin and growth hormone in addition to insulin. However, since the insulin levels are significantly elevated, insulinoma is the most likely cause."
