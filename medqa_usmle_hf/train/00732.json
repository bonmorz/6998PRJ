The symptoms indicate a possible diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot, where the right ventricular outflow tract is obstructed. This will lead to a boot-shaped heart on chest x-ray (B). A displaced tricuspid valve (C) may be seen in Ebstein\u2019s anomaly, but this doesn\u2019t explain the other symptoms. An egg on a string (A) typically represents transposition of the great arteries, which is less likely given the presence of a systolic ejection murmur. An atrial septal defect (D) may cause a right-sided enlargement, but not a boot-shaped appearance."
