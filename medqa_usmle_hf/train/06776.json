Reporting the infection to the national health authorities is the most appropriate action, as it is required by law to protect public health. The physician's duty is to protect the health of the public and not to withhold information about a contagious disease that could put others at risk. Informing the patient's wife may be a breach of confidentiality unless the patient authorizes it or it is required by law. Offering repeat antibody testing is not necessary, as fourth-generation tests are highly accurate. Waiting for a week before disclosing the results is not appropriate, as it may put the patient's wife at risk during this period."
