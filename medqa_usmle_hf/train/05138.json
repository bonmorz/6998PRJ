The symptoms and changes on the ECG suggest that there is dilation of the coronary vasculature, which can lead to reduced blood flow to the heart muscles and result in chest tightness, ST depression, and T wave inversion. Transient atrioventricular nodal blockade and reduced left ventricular preload are unlikely to cause these symptoms. Ruptured cholesterol plaque is a cause of myocardial infarction, which is not suggested by the symptoms in this case."
