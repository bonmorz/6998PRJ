The image shows multiple radiopaque shadows, including one in the right upper quadrant that is outlined by a thin, smooth line, consistent with a gallstone. The patient\u2019s history of recurrent right upper abdominal pain further supports the diagnosis of cholelithiasis. The question asks what the patient is at risk for developing, and among the options provided, only carcinoma of the gallbladder is associated with long-standing gallstones. Therefore, the correct answer is (D). The other answer choices are not supported by the information provided in the question stem or the image."

As a result, the patient is at risk for developing carcinoma of the gallbladder. Gallbladder carcinoma is most commonly associated with gallstones or a history of chronic cholecystitis. Patients with gallstones are also at risk for other complications such as acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, and pancreatitis. However, the other options, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, peritonitis secondary to hydatid cyst rupture or aortic aneurysm rupture are not associated with the imaging findings."
