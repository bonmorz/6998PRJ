The patient's symptoms suggest benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which can also cause difficulty urinating. Abdominal ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step in management to confirm the diagnosis of AAA and monitor its size. CT scan with contrast can also be used but has more radiation exposure. Aortic arteriography is not necessary unless there are concerns about surgical intervention. PSA level testing can help diagnose prostate cancer but is not necessary as the patient's physical examination suggests BPH."

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest that he may have an enlarged prostate and possible abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) given the pulsatile mass at the level of the umbilicus. Abdominal ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step to evaluate both the prostate and the AAA. CT scan with contrast and aortic arteriography may also be used to evaluate the AAA, but abdominal ultrasonography is less invasive and has fewer risks. PSA level testing may be useful to evaluate the prostate, but it is not specific for diagnosing prostate cancer and may not be necessary if the patient chooses to undergo an ultrasound."
