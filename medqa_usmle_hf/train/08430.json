The symptoms of intermittent diffuse abdominal pain, worse after eating meals, and bloody diarrhea suggest ischemic bowel disease. Weight loss is also a common symptom. SLE and difficult medical management may be contributing factors. Mild diffuse abdominal tenderness supports this diagnosis. Ulcerative colitis may have similar symptoms but usually presents with more severe abdominal tenderness and diarrhea. Small bowel obstruction typically presents with vomiting and abdominal distension. Acute pancreatitis usually presents with severe abdominal pain that radiates to the back and is associated with elevated amylase or lipase levels."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, such as abdominal pain that worsens after eating, diarrhea, and weight loss, suggest an inflammatory bowel disease. However, the presence of bloody diarrhea and severe pain raises suspicion for ischemic bowel disease, which is a complication of SLE. The mild diffuse abdominal tenderness may be due to the underlying inflammatory process. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is ischemic bowel disease."

Ischemic bowel disease, on the other hand, causes abdominal pain after eating and weight loss.
