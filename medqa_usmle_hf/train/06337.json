Among the options, only N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism is associated with emergence delirium. NMDA receptors are involved in learning, memory, and perception, and their antagonism can lead to hallucinations and delusions. Increased duration of GABA-gated chloride channel opening is associated with sedation and anxiolysis, while stimulation of \u03bc-opioid receptors and blocking the fast voltage-gated Na+ channels are associated with pain relief."
