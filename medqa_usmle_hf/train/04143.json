The patient\u2019s symptoms of weakness, calf muscle hypertrophy, and elevated creatine kinase are suggestive of muscular dystrophy. The genetic analysis detecting a dystrophin gene mutation and the muscle biopsy revealing reduced dystrophin narrow the diagnosis to either Becker muscular dystrophy or Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, Becker muscular dystrophy has a milder onset and slower progression than Duchenne muscular dystrophy, making it the more likely diagnosis in this case. Pompe disease is a metabolic disorder that presents with symptoms of generalized muscle weakness and pulmonary insufficiency, but without muscle hypertrophy. Spinal muscular atrophy presents with muscle weakness and atrophy but without hypertrophy."

Pompe disease presents with cardiac symptoms in addition to muscle weakness, while spinal muscular atrophy presents with weakness in the proximal muscles of the limbs and trunk."

The patient has progressive weakness, calf muscle hypertrophy, and an elevated creatine kinase, which are all indicative of muscular dystrophy. The presence of a dystrophin gene mutation and reduced dystrophin on muscle biopsy point specifically to Becker muscular dystrophy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy typically presents at a younger age and has a more severe phenotype, while Pompe disease involves the lysosomal storage of glycogen and is not associated with dystrophin mutations. Spinal muscular atrophy is associated with motor neuron dysfunction and presents differently than muscular dystrophy."

The clinical scenario suggests a muscular dystrophy, and the presence of calf muscle hypertrophy and genetic analysis detecting a dystrophin gene mutation are most consistent with Becker muscular dystrophy.

Pompe disease is a disorder of glycogen metabolism and typically presents with cardiomyopathy and respiratory involvement. Spinal muscular atrophy is a genetic disorder affecting the motor neurons and resulting in muscle weakness and atrophy, but it does not typically present with calf muscle hypertrophy."
