The patient's symptoms, including fever and sore throat, suggest an infection rather than a side effect of methimazole. However, laboratory studies show leukopenia with lymphocytosis, which are potentially indicative of agranulocytosis, a rare but serious side effect of methimazole. Therefore, methimazole should be discontinued and the patient should be closely monitored for resolution of agranulocytosis. Switching to propylthiouracil may also be considered, but the priority is to address the potential adverse effect of methimazole. Bone marrow biopsy is not needed at this time, and initiation of antibiotics is not warranted given the absence of clear signs of infection."
