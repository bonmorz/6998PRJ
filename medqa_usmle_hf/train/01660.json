Involving other family members may be helpful for support and communication, but the decision ultimately lies with the durable power of attorney."

Her wishes should be respected, as long as they are in line with the patient\u2019s known wishes and values.

While it is important to consider the daughter\u2019s opinion, ultimately the decision falls to the patient\u2019s designated decision maker. Compromising on withdrawing fluids and antibiotics but keeping the patient intubated is not a viable option as it prolongs the patient\u2019s suffering and can cause further harm.
