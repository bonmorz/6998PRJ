The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with post-dural puncture headache (PDPH), which can occur following an epidural anesthesia.

PDPH typically resolves spontaneously within a few days to a few weeks. Immediate intervention is not required; however, conservative management options such as hydration and caffeine intake can help alleviate symptoms.
