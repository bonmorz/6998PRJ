CT angiogram is a commonly used test for diagnosing PE, but given the patient\u2019s elevated serum creatinine, there is concern for contrast-induced nephropathy. Therefore, ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan would be the best confirmatory test in this patient as it does not require contrast administration and is less likely to cause further renal impairment. Arterial blood gas and D-dimer may be helpful in some cases but are not specific for PE."
