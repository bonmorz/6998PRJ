The patient presented with a stroke and developed symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome, which was managed with oxygen, aspirin, carvedilol, and furosemide. The elevated troponin levels, left ventricular hypertrophy, and Kerley B lines on chest radiograph suggest congestive heart failure (CHF). The heparin infusion indicates a high suspicion of CHF with superimposed acute coronary syndrome, which may have precipitated thrombosis or embolization of the cerebral vessels, leading to the stroke. The drop in platelet count suggests heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a known complication of heparin therapy. Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor that can be used as an alternative to heparin in the setting of HIT. Dalteparin, Protamine, and Tinzaparin are not indicated for HIT."
