The patient\u2019s history, physical examination, and lipid profile suggest that he has hypertriglyceridemia and possibly familial hypercholesterolemia. Modifying therapy with fenofibrate, a medication that lowers triglycerides and LDL cholesterol, would be the most appropriate choice among the options. Simvastatin, although useful in reducing LDL cholesterol, may worsen hypertriglyceridemia. Metformin is used to treat type 2 diabetes and is not indicated in this patient. Aprotinin is a medication used to reduce bleeding during surgery and is not indicated in this patient."
