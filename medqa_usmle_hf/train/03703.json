The girl\u2019s symptoms suggest narcolepsy, which is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, weight gain, and hypnagogic hallucinations. During physical examination, she exhibits cataplexy, which is often seen in narcolepsy. Polysomnography is used to diagnose narcolepsy and would reveal a rapid onset of beta waves during sleep onset. Periodic sharp waves and slow spike-wave patterns are associated with epilepsy, while decreased delta wave sleep duration is associated with sleep deprivation."
