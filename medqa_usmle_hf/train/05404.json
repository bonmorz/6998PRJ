The question is asking for the intracellular changes involved in the pathogenesis of the finding that the high-lipid diet group has a higher serum glucose after receiving insulin. Increased activity of serine kinases is known to be involved in insulin resistance, which could lead to higher serum glucose levels in response to insulin. Decreased expression of TP53, increased exposure of nuclear localization signal, and decreased activation of caspase 8 are unrelated to glucose metabolism in response to insulin."
