The symptoms of intense left-sided back pain and dryness in eyes and mouth suggest the possibility of Sjogren's syndrome, which can cause renal tubular acidosis (RTA) type 1. The laboratory results show a low serum K+ and low bicarbonate concentration, which is consistent with RTA type 1. The arterial blood gas shows a low pH and low HCO3-, which is also consistent with RTA type 1. The most likely cause of RTA type 1 in this case is decreased renal excretion of hydrogen ions. Therefore, the correct answer is (C)."
