Since the patient's ulcer was left untreated for a week, it is likely to heal by secondary intention, which produces a larger scar as there is a greater volume of granulation tissue formed. This granulation tissue fills the wound space, followed by wound contraction as the edges of the wound are pulled together. Option B is incorrect as large tissue defects actually delay healing by providing a better environment for bacterial growth. Option C is incorrect as inflammation is a necessary part of the healing process, and it takes longer than 2 weeks for ulcer healing. Option D is incorrect as new epithelium covers the wound before granulation tissue is formed during the process of healing by secondary intention."
