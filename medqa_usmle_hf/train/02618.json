The symptoms, worsening back pain associated with prolonged standing or sitting, difficulty actively raising either leg while the knee is extended, and the physical examination with bilateral pain along the sacroiliac joint area and no tenderness during abdominal palpation suggest relaxation of the pelvic girdle ligaments as the most likely explanation. Placental abruption usually presents with vaginal bleeding and uterine tenderness. Rheumatoid arthritis usually presents with systemic symptoms and swelling and tenderness in multiple joints. Vertebral bone compression fracture can cause back pain, but the symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis."

The symptoms suggest a relaxation of the pelvic girdle ligaments typically seen in the third trimester of pregnancy, known as sacroiliac joint pain or pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain. Option A is unlikely as there is no trauma or risk factors for compression fracture, and motor and sensory function are normal. Option B is also unlikely as there is no vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain which are common symptoms of placental abruption. Option D is unlikely as there is no family history of back pain or morning stiffness which are common symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis."
