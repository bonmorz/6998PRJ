The circular patches of complete hair loss, associated pruritus and burning sensation, and the histologic findings of peribulbar lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate suggest the most likely diagnosis is Alopecia Areata.

Telogen effluvium would have diffuse hair shedding, and androgenic alopecia would have thinning hair in the pattern of androgens."
