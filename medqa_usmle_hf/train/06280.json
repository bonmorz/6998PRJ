CT scan of the abdomen and surgical management options (salpingectomy and salpingostomy) are not appropriate as the initial steps in managing a suspected ectopic pregnancy."

The positive pregnancy test and elevated beta-hCG suggest pregnancy, but the inability to identify an intrauterine pregnancy on ultrasound raises concern for an ectopic pregnancy.

A CT scan of the abdomen is not necessary for initial management of a suspected ectopic pregnancy. Thus, the best next step would be to repeat the beta-hCG in 2 days to monitor for trends and provide further information about the location of the pregnancy."
