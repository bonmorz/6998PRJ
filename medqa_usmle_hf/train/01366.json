The study is investigating an association between maternal exposure to secondhand smoke and low birth weight, and the groups are defined by birth weight and smoking exposure. The strongest measure of association that can be calculated from this study is the odds ratio, which compares the odds of exposure in the low birth weight group to the odds of exposure in the normal birth weight group. It is calculated by dividing the odds of exposure in the low birth weight group by the odds of exposure in the normal birth weight group. A rate ratio compares incidence rates, absolute risk compares the actual risk of an outcome, and risk difference compares the difference in risk between groups."

This study is an example of a case-control study, where subjects are chosen based on outcome (in this case, low birth weight) and then their exposure (in this case, maternal exposure to 2nd-hand smoke) is compared to a control group without the outcome. The strongest measure of association for a case-control study is the odds ratio, which is calculated as the odds of exposure among cases divided by the odds of exposure among controls. The other options listed are measures of association for cohort studies, which are different from case-control studies."

Since the study is attempting to determine an association between maternal exposure to 2nd-hand smoke and low birth weight, the most appropriate measure of association in this case is the odds ratio. This will allow for comparison of the odds of exposure to 2nd-hand smoke between the two groups and determine whether there is a significant association between exposure and low birth weight. The rate ratio is not appropriate because the study is not looking at incidence rates, and absolute risk and risk difference do not provide a measure of association."
