Rust remover is typically composed of strong acids or alkaline substances that can lead to chemical burns and tissue damage in the upper digestive tract. This damage can result in esophageal strictures, which is the narrowing of the esophagus that may cause difficulty swallowing and food impaction. Esophageal webs are thin membranes that may form across the upper part of the esophagus due to various causes, but not typically as a result of chemical ingestion. Mallory-Weiss tears refer to tears in the mucosa at the gastroesophageal junction or lower esophagus due to forceful vomiting or retching, which is not reported in this case. Oral cavity cancer is unlikely to be a long-term complication of this acute exposure."
