Option D suggests electrolyte imbalance but does not explain the elevated pH. The patient\u2019s weight loss may contribute to her overall health, but it is not directly related to her symptoms."

Heavy alcohol consumption and weight loss may cause electrolyte imbalances, but they are not typically associated with respiratory alkalosis.
