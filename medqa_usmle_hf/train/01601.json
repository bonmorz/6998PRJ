VA (alveolar ventilation) can be calculated using the formula VA = (tidal volume - dead space) x respiratory rate. Assuming a tidal volume of 500 ml and a dead space of 150 ml, we get VA = (500-150) x 14 = 5,600 ml/min. K is a conversion factor that equals 0.863. Plugging the numbers into the formula, we get PACO2 = (200 / 5,600) x 0.863 = 0.031 mm Hg, which is approximately 18 mm Hg. Therefore, the answer is (A)."

We can calculate PB by subtracting the partial pressure of water vapor from atmospheric pressure, which is 760 - 47 = 713 mm Hg.

The equation is: PAO2 = PiO2 - (PACO2/R), where PAO2 is the alveolar oxygen pressure, PiO2 is the inspired oxygen pressure, PACO2 is the alveolar carbon dioxide pressure, and R is the respiratory exchange ratio. Since the patient's respiratory rate is 28/min and the normal respiratory rate is 14/min, we can calculate that the patient is hyperventilating and her respiratory exchange ratio is less than 1. So we can assume a respiratory exchange ratio of 0.8. Therefore, we can rearrange the equation to solve for PACO2: PACO2 = (PiO2 - PAO2) x R. Since we are given that PACO2 is 36 mm Hg at a normal respiratory rate, we can calculate that PAO2 is approximately 88 mm Hg using the alveolar gas equation. We can then plug in these values to solve for the new PACO2: PACO2 = (149 - 88) x 0.8 = 48.8 mm Hg. However, we need to take into account the fact that the patient is hyperventilating, which will decrease her PACO2. Hyperventilation causes a decrease in PACO2 of approximately 2-4 mm Hg per breath for every 1/min increase in respiratory rate. Since the patient's respiratory rate is 28/min and the normal respiratory rate is 14/min, we can assume that her PACO2 will be decreased by approximately 8-16 mm Hg. Therefore, her approximate PACO2 would be 36 - 8 = 28 mm Hg to 36 - 16 = 20 mm Hg. The closest option is (A) 18 mm Hg, which is within this range."
