The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), a disorder of heme synthesis that causes painful, blistering skin lesions. PCT is caused by a mutation that impairs the function of an enzyme involved in heme production, which can lead to the buildup of porphyrins in the skin. This buildup is triggered by environmental factors such as exposure to sunlight or certain chemicals, including alcohol and estrogens. The patient\u2019s use of an estrogen-based oral contraceptive and alcohol consumption suggest these as possible triggers. Elevated urinary uroporphyrin levels will confirm the diagnosis of PCT."

The patient has blisters on her hands, forearms, and face with hyperpigmented skin and atrophic white scars, which suggest porphyria cutanea tarda. This is supported by her history of alcohol consumption and estrogen-based oral contraceptive. Elevated urinary uroporphyrin is a diagnostic test for porphyria cutanea tarda. None of the other options are associated with the patient's symptoms. Anti-Smith antibodies are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, anti-varicella zoster virus antibodies are associated with varicella zoster virus infection, and a positive skin patch test can indicate an allergic reaction."
