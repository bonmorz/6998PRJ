The microbiology results indicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, and the patient\u2019s condition suggests a severe infection. Aztreonam and tobramycin have been shown to have synergistic effects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, making them a good choice for treatment in this scenario. Option A is incorrect because tobramycin is not effective against gram-positive cocci. Option B is questionable because both drugs are bactericidal, but the synergistic effect is the primary rationale for choosing this combination. Option D is incorrect because tobramycin does not provide coverage against anaerobes."

Option A is not accurate as tobramycin does not provide broad-spectrum coverage against gram-positive cocci. Option B is partially correct, but the choice of antibiotics is based on their effectiveness against the specific pathogen, not just their bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity. Option D is incorrect as tobramycin does not provide broad-spectrum coverage against anaerobes."

Aztreonam is a beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits the bacterial cell wall synthesis, while tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. The combination of both antibiotics has shown synergistic effects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as they work through different targets, leading to enhanced efficacy.
