Topical pimecrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor that inhibits T-cell activation by blocking dephosphorylation of serine residues of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). This in turn prevents release of inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-2 and interferon gamma, which are involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. Therefore, the beneficial effect of pimecrolimus on the itchy rash is best explained by its anti-inflammatory properties."

Topical pimecrolimus is an immunomodulatory drug that inhibits the activation of T-cells by inhibiting calcineurin-dependent cytokine synthesis. This leads to reduced inflammation and itching. The inhibition of calcineurin involves dephosphorylation of serine, making option (D) the correct answer. Options (A) and (B) are related to nucleotide metabolism, and option (C) is related to folic acid synthesis, but none of these processes are affected by pimecrolimus."
