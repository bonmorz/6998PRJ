The patient\u2019s symptoms and fracture suggest osteomalacia, a condition where bones become weak and brittle as they lose minerals such as calcium.

Ergosterol, cholecalciferol, and 7-dehydrocholesterol are all precursors to Vitamin D and not directly involved in calcium absorption or bone mineralization."
