The clinical presentation and history of recent immigration without vaccination records increases the suspicion for Rubella."

The tiny rose-colored lesions on the soft palate and enlarged tender lymph nodes in the suboccipital, postauricular and anterior cervical regions also support the diagnosis of Rubella. Measles presents with a rash that starts on the face and spreads downwards, but the rash typically lasts longer and is more severe compared to Rubella. Roseola presents with sudden high fever for a few days, which subsequently breaks and is followed by a rash. Parvovirus B19 infection is associated with a characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash, which is absent in this patient."
