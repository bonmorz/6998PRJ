The patient in this case presents with symptoms of panic disorder, which is most commonly associated with avoidant personality disorder. This disorder is characterized by feelings of inadequacy, sensitivity to criticism, avoidance of social interaction, and intense fear of rejection. Submissive, clingy behavior and low self-confidence are also common features of avoidant personality disorder, making option D the correct answer. Criminality and disregard for the rights of others are more indicative of antisocial personality disorder, eccentric appearance and magical thinking are more indicative of schizotypal personality disorder, and social withdrawal and limited emotional expression are more indicative of schizoid personality disorder."
