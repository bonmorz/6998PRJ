The medication prescribed is likely to be Trientine, which increases urine copper excretion. One possible adverse effect of Trientine is exacerbation of neurological symptoms such as tremors, ataxia, and myasthenia gravis. Constipation and weight gain are not common adverse effects of Trientine. Sensorineural deafness is a complication of Meniere's disease, which is unrelated to Wilson's disease."
