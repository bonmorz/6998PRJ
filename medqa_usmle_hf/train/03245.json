To solve for k, we use the equation ln(C/C0)=-kt. Inserting the given values, we get ln(30/60)=-k*3 hours, which yields k=0.231 hr^-1. To find the drug concentration at 9 hours, we use the equation C=C0*e^-kt and insert the known values, yielding C=60*e^(-0.231*9), which equals approximately 7.5 U/L. Therefore, the answer is (B)."

We can calculate the elimination rate constant as k = (ln C0 - ln C)/t, where ln is the natural logarithm function. Substituting the given values, we get k = (ln 60 - ln 30)/3 = 0.231. Using this value of k, we can calculate the drug concentration at any time by rearranging the first-order kinetics formula. At 9 hours after administration, t = 9 and C0 = 60, so C = 60*e^(-0.231*9) = 7.5 U/L. Therefore, the answer is (B)."

Therefore, after 9 hours, the serum concentration would have decreased by two half-lives, which results in (1/2) x (1/2) = 1/4 of the initial concentration. Thus, the serum concentration after 9 hours would be 60 U/L x (1/4) = 15 U/L. However, the answer choices do not include 15 U/L, so the closest option is (B) 7.5 U/L, which is half of 15 U/L."

The half-life can be calculated using the formula t1/2 = 0.693/k, where k is the elimination rate constant. Since the serum concentration decreased from 60 U/L to 30 U/L in 3 hours, we can calculate the elimination rate constant for this drug as 0.693/(3 hours) = 0.231 hr^-1. Using this value, we can calculate the half-life as t1/2 = 0.693/0.231 = 3 hours. Therefore, 6 hours after administration of the drug, the serum concentration would have decreased to 15 U/L, and 9 hours after administration, the serum concentration would have decreased to 7.5 U/L.
