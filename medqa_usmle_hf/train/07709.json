While schizophrenia can occur in young children, it is very rare, and a diagnosis cannot be made until the age of 5. In addition, the symptoms described in the question are not indicative of schizophrenia, but rather suggest normal childhood behavior and imagination. Developmental delay or a specific personality disorder cannot be diagnosed based on the information provided. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is normal development."
