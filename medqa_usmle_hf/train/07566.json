The patient\u2019s presentation is consistent with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which is characterized by fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic dysfunction. The patient\u2019s current medications, especially haloperidol, can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Delirium tremens is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal and presents with agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. Herpes simplex encephalitis presents with fever, altered mental status, and focal neurological deficits. Bacterial meningitis presents with fever, headache, stiff neck and can progress rapidly with decreased level of consciousness. While these conditions can cause altered mental status and fever, the presence of muscle rigidity and the patient\u2019s history with medications suggest neuroleptic malignant syndrome as the most likely diagnosis."
