Hereditary spectrin defect can also cause hemolytic anemia but is unlikely to be the cause in this case given the patient\u2019s age of onset. Bicuspid aortic valve is not a known predisposing factor for autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can cause hemolytic anemia, but it is not the most likely factor in this patient\u2019s case."
