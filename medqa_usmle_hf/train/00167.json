The symptoms, including headache and palpitations, suggest catecholamine excess, which can be caused by a pheochromocytoma. Hyperpolarization-activated, nucleotide-gated channels are responsible for pacemaker activity in the heart and the rate of firing can affect heart rate. Therefore, the change in activity in these channels is likely responsible for the patient's increased heart rate."

The increased heart rate is most likely due to increased activity of hyperpolarization-activated, nucleotide-gated channels. These channels are found in the heart's sinus node and contribute to pacemaker activity, so increased activity can lead to increased heart rate. T-type calcium channels are involved in neuronal excitability, voltage-gated sodium channels are involved in action potential generation, and voltage-gated potassium channels are involved in repolarization of the cell after an action potential. While these channels may be affected in certain conditions, they are not most likely the cause of the patient's symptoms in this case."
