Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and adenocarcinoma of the lung are possible complications of longstanding smoking, which is not mentioned as a part of this patient\u2019s history.

The patient has a history of working in a sandblasting factory, and his chest X-ray shows calcified hilar lymph nodes which look like an eggshell. These are classic radiologic findings for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, making option D the correct answer. The patient\u2019s history of a chronic cough which is progressively getting worse further supports this diagnosis. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and adenocarcinoma of the lung may cause respiratory symptoms, but are not associated with calcified hilar lymph nodes like in this patient\u2019s case. Pulmonary embolism is not suggested by this patient's history or physical examination."
