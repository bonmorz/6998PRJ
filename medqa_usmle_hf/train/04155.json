Galactose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency, also known as galactosemia, can cause jaundice and liver dysfunction but not hypoglycemia. Fructokinase deficiency, also known as essential fructosuria, causes benign elevated levels of fructose in urine but not hypoglycemia. Acid maltase deficiency, also known as Pompe disease, causes muscle weakness and cardiopulmonary failure but not hypoglycemia."
