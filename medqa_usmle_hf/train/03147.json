The patient was involved in a motor vehicle collision and is presenting with signs of shock, abdominal pain and diffuse abdominal tenderness. The initial evaluation should include intravenous fluid resuscitation and diagnostic testing to assess for potential intra-abdominal injuries. In this case, a diagnostic peritoneal lavage would be the most appropriate next step since the FAST results are inconclusive and the patient is unstable. A CT scan of the abdomen may be considered once the patient is stable, and an exploratory laparotomy may be necessary if there is evidence of significant intra-abdominal injury. X-ray of the abdomen would not provide sufficient information in this scenario."

Exploratory laparotomy may be necessary if there is evidence of ongoing bleeding or organ damage, but it is a more invasive procedure with higher risk than diagnostic peritoneal lavage."
