CD56 positive cells, also known as natural killer (NK) cells, are responsible for detecting and eliminating virally infected cells and cancer cells in the body. They have cell surface receptors that detect MHC class 1 on other cells, which helps them determine if a cell is normal or abnormal. Option (B) is incorrect because NK cells do not require MHC class 1 to be expressed on the target cell to eliminate it, as they can also target cells with reduced MHC class 1 expression. Option (C) is incorrect because NK cells differentiate from lymphoid progenitors, not myeloid progenitors. Option (D) is incorrect because NK cells do not express the T cell receptor."
