Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia would present with fragmentation of red blood cells, not Heinz bodies. The patient's recent trip to Nigeria and receiving anti-malaria prophylaxis also increase the likelihood of G6PD deficiency."

The patient recently received anti-malaria prophylaxis, which can trigger hemolysis in individuals with G6PD deficiency.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia and PNH usually have different symptoms and signs, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is not related to anti-malaria prophylaxis or G6PD deficiency. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is G6PD deficiency."
