Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped by the heart per minute and can be calculated by multiplying stroke volume (the difference between EDV and ESV) by heart rate (in beats per minute). Thus, the correct formula is (EDV-ESV) * heart rate = (160-100) * 115 = 6,900 mL/min. Option (A) only calculates stroke volume, not cardiac output. Option (C) calculates the ejection fraction, which is the percentage of blood in the ventricle that is pumped out of the heart with each beat. Option (D) calculates mean arterial pressure using the formula MAP = (2/3 * diastolic pressure) + (1/3 * systolic pressure), but this is not relevant for determining cardiac output in this patient."
