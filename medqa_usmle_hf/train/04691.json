Increased pulmonary shunt fraction, which can occur due to the presence of fluid in the lungs or poor gas exchange, is the most likely cause of the patient's decreased oxygen saturation despite ventilation with supplemental oxygen. Increased pulmonary wedge pressure, which can occur in heart failure, would not cause opacities in all lung fields. Increased mixed venous oxygen saturation and decreased pulmonary artery pressure are not associated with the patient's pulmonary condition."
