The patient\u2019s history of hypertension and lack of medication compliance increases the risk for complications such as left ventricular hypertrophy or heart failure. A heart sound prior to S1 is likely a fourth heart sound, which can indicate left ventricular hypertrophy. Normal S1 and S2, heart sound after S2, and a holosystolic murmur at the apex are less likely given the patient\u2019s history and physical exam findings."

The patient has a history of myocardial infarction, hypertension, and is currently experiencing elevated blood pressure. Additionally, he has not been filling his prescriptions regularly, which could lead to improper management of his conditions. The most likely cardiac finding in this case would be a heart sound prior to S1, indicating an S4 heart sound due to left ventricular hypertrophy from long-term hypertension. Normal S1 and S2 would not be expected in this patient given his history and current blood pressure. Heart sound after S2 could indicate aortic stenosis or pulmonary hypertension, which would not be expected based on the patient's history. A holosystolic murmur at the apex would indicate mitral regurgitation or a ventricular septal defect, which may not be related to the patient's current presentation."
