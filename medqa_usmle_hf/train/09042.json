The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest urinary retention, and the drug most commonly used to treat this condition is a parasympathetic agonist, such as Bethanechol, which stimulates the detrusor muscle of the bladder to contract and empty the bladder. Sympathetic agonists, such as epinephrine, would exacerbate urinary retention. Alpha-blockers and beta-blockers are used to treat other conditions, such as hypertension or benign prostatic hyperplasia, but not urinary retention."
