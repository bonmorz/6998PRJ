The pale yellow mucosa with erythema and ulcerations in the duodenum and infiltration of the lamina propria with PAS-positive macrophages confirm the diagnosis. Crohn's disease is characterized by transmural inflammation of the bowel wall and may cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss but does not typically involve the duodenum. Giardia lamblia infection usually causes diarrhea and abdominal pain but not weight loss or impaired concentration.
