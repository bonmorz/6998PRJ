The milky white fluid in the pleural space that remains uniform after centrifugation and the low serum sodium concentration indicate chylothorax. Chyle is a lipid-rich fluid, so further analysis of the fluid would most likely show high triglycerides. Antinuclear antibodies are associated with autoimmune diseases, high adenosine deaminase is associated with tuberculosis, and high LDH can be present in many types of pleural effusions."
