The high total bilirubin and deep yellow staining of the brain suggest that the infant had kernicterus, a severe complication of hyperbilirubinemia. Among the options, impaired glucuronidation of bilirubin is the most likely cause. Impaired conjugation of bilirubin with glucuronic acid leads to the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin, which can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause kernicterus. Defective intracellular bilirubin transport, extrahepatic obliteration of the biliary tree, and decreased bilirubin uptake in hepatocytes are not likely causes of kernicterus."

The high levels of total bilirubin and deep yellow staining of the basal ganglia and subthalamic nuclei suggest kernicterus, which is a complication of hyperbilirubinemia that affects the brain.

Defective intracellular bilirubin transport, extrahepatic obliteration of the biliary tree, and decreased bilirubin uptake in hepatocytes are not directly related to hyperbilirubinemia and do not cause kernicterus."

The high total bilirubin and deep yellow staining of the basal ganglia and subthalamic nuclei suggest kernicterus, which is a neurological condition caused by high levels of unconjugated bilirubin. Impaired glucuronidation of bilirubin can cause an increase in unconjugated bilirubin levels, leading to kernicterus. Defective intracellular bilirubin transport and decreased bilirubin uptake in hepatocytes are possible causes of hyperbilirubinemia but not specifically associated with kernicterus. Extrahepatic obliteration of the biliary tree would lead to obstructive jaundice but not necessarily kernicterus, and the direct bilirubin level in the scenario was normal."
