The patient had a history of chronic constipation and postprandial abdominal pain, and recently had a percutaneous intervention for an inferior wall STEMI.

The dark hemorrhagic appearance of the sigmoid colon during autopsy supports this diagnosis. Mucosal infarction would not cause hypotension, toxic megacolon would produce abdominal distension, and adenocarcinoma would not have such an acute onset."

Toxic megacolon can cause abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, but it is usually associated with inflammatory bowel disease or infections, which the patient did not have. Adenocarcinoma is a slow-growing cancer and would not cause sudden onset of symptoms and rapid deterioration."

The autopsy finding of a dark hemorrhagic appearance of the sigmoid colon is consistent with the diagnosis of ischemic colitis with transmural infarction, which was the most likely pathology related to her death. Toxic megacolon may present similarly, but it is not associated with ischemia. Mucosal infarct may be a complication of ischemic colitis but is unlikely to be the cause of death.
