The patient's symptoms, including chest pain and a late systolic murmur, suggest calcification of the aortic valve, also known as aortic stenosis. The murmurs associated with aortic stenosis are characterized by a crescendo-decrescendo pattern, which radiates to the carotids. Fibrosis of the sinus node can cause arrhythmia, but it is not consistent with the patient's history and symptoms. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy is frequently seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but this is not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. An embolus in the pulmonary artery is an acute condition that would present with sudden onset of respiratory distress, which is not described here."
