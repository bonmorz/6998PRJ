The production of hypochlorous acid by MPO results in the green color of sputum in pneumonia patients, due to breakdown of neutrophils and release of their enzymes. This is known as pus and is often associated with bacterial infections. Coughing and rust-tinged sputum may also be present, but they are not directly related to MPO's action. Shortness of breath is a more serious symptom that may not necessarily be related to the presence of MPO in pneumonia."
