The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and history of smoking suggest that she has developed mitral stenosis. This can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, specifically atrial fibrillation, which is a common complication of mitral stenosis. While infective endocarditis and myocarditis are possible complications, they are not the most commonly associated with mitral stenosis. High-output heart failure is also possible in severe cases, but it is not the most likely complication in this patient."
