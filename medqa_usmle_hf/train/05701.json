The intermittent, soft, nontender nature of the swelling and its reducibility indicate that it is likely a hydrocele, a common condition in infants that usually resolves on its own within the first year of life. Reassurance and follow-up is the most appropriate step as it will likely resolve on its own. Surgical excision or ligation of the patent processus vaginalis would be considered if the hydrocele persists beyond 1 year of age or if it becomes tense and painful.
