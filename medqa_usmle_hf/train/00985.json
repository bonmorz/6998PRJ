The patient was found unconscious, has difficulty speaking and has slurred words, which are common symptoms of a seizure. The muscle pain and fatigue may be due to the physical exertion during the seizure, and the 2-cm bruise on the right shoulder may be a result of a fall during the seizure. The ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy, which may be a risk factor for seizures. Migraine and syncope would not cause the symptoms described and a transient ischemic attack would have shown abnormalities on the CT scan."

Syncope is a brief loss of consciousness and is unlikely to cause the patient's symptoms. Migraine can cause headache and neurological symptoms, but not the left arm weakness. Transient ischemic attack can cause neurological symptoms, but not the left arm weakness lasting for this long a duration."
