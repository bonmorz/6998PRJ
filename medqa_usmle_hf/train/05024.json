The symptoms of chronic joint pain and moving from one joint to another, along with subjective fevers, suggest a possible diagnosis of Lyme disease, which is caused by a spirochete (Borrelia burgdorferi). Option A, gram-negative diplococci, could suggest Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which can cause joint pain, but it does not match the other symptoms described in the case. Options C and D do not match the symptoms described."
