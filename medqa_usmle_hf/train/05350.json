The different mechanisms of oncogenesis for each hepatitis virus are as follows: Hepatitis A virus - no evidence of oncogenicity, Hepatitis B virus - integration of viral DNA into host hepatocyte genome, leading to chronic inflammation and hepatocellular carcinoma, Hepatitis C virus - chronic inflammation and direct oncogenic activity, Hepatitis D virus - cannot cause infection on its own but can exacerbate hepatitis B virus infection and increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, and Hepatitis E virus - no evidence of oncogenicity.
