The gram-negative pleomorphic, obligate intracellular bacteria is likely to be Chlamydia or Rickettsia, which are not common causes of acute pharyngitis. The gram-positive beta-hemolytic cocci in chains suggests Group A Streptococcus, which is a common bacterial cause of acute pharyngitis, but the negative rapid antigen detection test makes this option less likely. The naked, double-stranded DNA virus is most likely to be a type of adenovirus, which is a common viral cause of acute pharyngitis. The enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus is most likely to be a type of herpesvirus, which is a less common cause of acute pharyngitis in children."
