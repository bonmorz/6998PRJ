The symptoms of dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath, and positive occult blood in stool suggest gastrointestinal bleeding. The low hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume confirm the anemia. A filling defect on a double-contrast barium enema study is most likely due to a polyp or tumor, which could be causing the bleeding. The rectosigmoid colon is a common location for such lesions. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Filling defect of the rectosigmoid colon. The Thumbprint sign is seen in acute colitis, the Lead pipe sign is seen in chronic ulcerative colitis, and the String sign is seen in Crohn's disease."
