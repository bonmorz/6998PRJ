The fetus in transverse lie means that it is positioned sideways in the uterus, which can increase the risk of complications during delivery. However, at 32 weeks gestation, there is still time for the fetus to turn into the head-down position before delivery. Expectant management involves monitoring the patient's progress and waiting for the fetus to turn on its own. If the fetus remains in a transverse lie closer to delivery, other options, such as external cephalic version or cesarean section, may be considered. Therefore, the best next step in management is expectant management."

A transverse lie at 32 weeks is not uncommon, and with expectant management, there is a 90% chance that the fetus will eventually turn to a head-down position.

Internal cephalic version can be done, but it carries a risk of rupture of membranes and should only be considered at or after 37 weeks.

In this scenario, the patient is 32 weeks pregnant and the fetus is in transverse lie, meaning it is lying horizontally in the uterus. The best next step in management is expectant management, as there is still time for the fetus to turn into a head-down position (vertex) on its own before delivery. Weekly ultrasound is not necessary at this point, as the fetus is only in transverse lie and not in a breech position (head up, buttocks or feet down). Internal cephalic version can be considered closer to term if the fetus remains in a non-vertex position. Caesarean section at 38 weeks is not indicated at this point, as the fetus is not in a breech presentation and there are no other medical indications for delivery at 38 weeks."
