MEN1 is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the MEN1 gene on chromosome 11, which encodes for the tumor suppressor protein menin. Abnormal elevation of a peptide suggests the presence of a neuroendocrine tumor, which is a common manifestation of MEN1. Chromosomes 5, 10, and 17 do not contain the MEN1 gene."
