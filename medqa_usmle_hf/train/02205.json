The patient\u2019s symptoms and history suggest biotin deficiency, which is caused by excessive consumption of raw egg whites. Biotin is a coenzyme involved in carboxylation reactions, and its deficiency leads to decreased activity of propionyl-CoA carboxylase. This enzyme requires biotin and ATP to convert propionyl-CoA to D-methylmalonyl-CoA, thus linking the Krebs cycle to the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids and odd-chain fatty acids. Among the options, only oxaloacetate is directly involved in the Krebs cycle, which can be affected by decreased activity of propionyl-CoA carboxylase."
