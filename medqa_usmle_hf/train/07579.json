The description of blisters lifting away from the basal lamina suggests that hemidesmosomes, which anchor epithelial cells to the extracellular matrix, are defective. This is characteristic of autoimmune bullous disorders such as bullous pemphigoid, which can present with tense blisters and a linear pattern of immune complex deposits on immunofluorescence. Gap junctions are involved in cell-to-cell communication, lamellar bodies are involved in skin barrier function, and zonula occludens are involved in tight junction formation."
