The fine pink and itchy rash that appeared after a low-grade fever is consistent with rubella, especially in a healthcare setting where there are frequent sick contacts. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to test for rubella antibodies in her blood. Administering anti-rubella antibodies or placing the patient in isolation would be unnecessary since the patient is already in her 8th week of gestation and has likely been exposed to rubella. Termination of pregnancy is not indicated at this point."
