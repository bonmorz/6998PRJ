The patient's history of multiple sclerosis and recent complaint of left upper extremity weakness suggest that the most likely etiology of his presentation is a medication side effect. The extremely high glucose level in the basic metabolic panel could indicate that the patient is taking steroids to control his multiple sclerosis, which can cause psychotic symptoms as a side effect. The other options are less likely given the patient's medical history and presentation."

The patient's history of multiple sclerosis and recent complaints of new left upper extremity weakness suggest a neurologic etiology. However, the sudden onset of bizarre behavior and comments about animals is more likely due to a medication side effect, specifically high blood sugar levels from the patient's glucose level of 356 mg/dL. This can cause confusion, disorientation, and hallucinations. Primary psychiatric illness and recreational drug intoxication cannot be ruled out completely, but are less likely given the patient's medical history and presentation. Progression of neurologic disease also cannot be completely ruled out, but is less likely to cause such sudden onset of behavioral symptoms."
