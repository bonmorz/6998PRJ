The fetal heart rate monitoring strip shows a baseline heart rate within normal range and variability, with only 3 decelerations occurring at differing intervals relative to the contractions. These findings do not indicate an emergent situation, so routine monitoring and continued labor is appropriate. Vibroacoustic stimulation is reserved for cases of uncertain fetal status. Emergent cesarean delivery is indicated only with evidence of fetal distress, such as recurrent late or prolonged decelerations. Tocolytics are not indicated in this case, as labor is already established."
