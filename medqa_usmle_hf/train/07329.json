The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and distended abdomen, are consistent with ischemic colitis, which is commonly caused by atherosclerosis. The patient's history of peripheral arterial disease and smoking also support this diagnosis. Hypokalemia and bacterial infection are less likely causes, as stool culture was negative for C. difficile, and there are no signs of bacterial sepsis. Upper GI bleeding would not explain the patient's symptoms of diarrhea and segmental colitis on CT scan."

The presence of bright red-colored stool further suggests an underlying vascular issue such as atherosclerosis. Hypokalemia can cause symptoms such as weakness and fatigue, but is not likely to cause severe abdominal pain and diarrhea. A bacterial infection may cause similar symptoms, but the negative stool culture makes this less likely. Upper GI bleeding would present with melena or black, tarry stool, which is not observed in this patient."
