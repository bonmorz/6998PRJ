The leukocyte count is also very high, which is a common finding in CML. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia typically present with more rapid onset of symptoms and higher blast counts on peripheral smear. Tuberculosis can cause night sweats but usually presents with respiratory symptoms and would not explain the elevated leukocyte count."
