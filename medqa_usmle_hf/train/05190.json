The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest rotator cuff tear, which commonly occurs in athletes involved in overhead activities such as volleyball. The pain worsens with arm elevation and abduction, and there is point tenderness on palpation of the anterolateral aspect of the left shoulder. IV disk protrusion at the C4-5 level would present with neck pain and may cause radicular symptoms. Intra-articular humeral fracture and shoulder joint dislocation would cause significant swelling and deformity which the patient does not exhibit. Hence, the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s condition is Tear of the supraspinatus muscle."

A herniated disc in the cervical spine may cause radiculopathy rather than localized shoulder pain.

The pain worsens with elevating or abducting the left arm, and there is point tenderness to palpation of the anterolateral aspect of the left shoulder. Limited range of active motion, normal range of passive motion with pain, and reduced strength supports this diagnosis. IV disk protrusion at the C4-5 level would typically present with neck pain and radicular pain in the lower cervical dermatomes. Intra-articular humeral fracture would present with pain, swelling, and decreased range of motion with strength unaffected unless it is a severe fracture. Shoulder joint dislocation would present with pain, swelling, instability, and limited range of motion."
