Among the options, hyperplasia of Peyer patches is most likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of this condition. Peyer patches are aggregations of lymphoid follicles located in the small intestine and are an important part of the immune system. Hyperplasia of these patches may lead to intussusception. Failure of neural crest migration may lead to Hirschsprung's disease, which causes chronic constipation and intestinal obstruction. Intestinal mass and vascular malformation may also cause intestinal obstruction, but they are less likely to be the cause of the symptoms in this patient."

Failure of neural crest migration leads to Hirschsprung disease, intestinal mass can be seen in neoplasms or intestinal obstruction, and vascular malformation can cause hematochezia or melena, but none of these are as likely as hyperplasia of Peyer patches for acute gastroenteritis."
