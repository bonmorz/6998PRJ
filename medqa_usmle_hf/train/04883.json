The recommended management for acetaminophen overdose is to give activated charcoal and draw a serum acetaminophen level as soon as possible, followed by a repeat serum level at four hours post-ingestion. In this case, since the patient presents within one hour of ingestion and is not in acute distress, activated charcoal can be given and serum acetaminophen level should be drawn in three hours to get a more accurate peak level. Testing urine for an acetaminophen level is not recommended."
