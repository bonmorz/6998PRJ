CT angiography can help diagnose mesenteric ischemia, which can present with diffuse abdominal pain and elevated lactate levels. Abdominal radiograph or ultrasound may not be sufficient for diagnosis and exploratory laparotomy is an invasive procedure that should only be considered if other tests are inconclusive."

The patient presents with severe abdominal pain, which can be caused by a variety of conditions such as appendicitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and mesenteric ischemia. The presence of normal bowel sounds and absence of guarding and rebound tenderness suggest mesenteric ischemia. The elevated lactate level also supports this diagnosis, as the ischemic bowel produces lactic acid. CT angiography is the next best step in diagnosis as it can quickly and accurately diagnose mesenteric ischemia. Plain abdominal radiograph may be helpful in other conditions but is not specific for mesenteric ischemia. Exploratory laparotomy is an invasive procedure, which is not appropriate for initial diagnosis. Abdominal duplex ultrasound is not the best diagnostic tool for mesenteric ischemia."
