Postmyocardial infarction syndrome would present with fever, pleuritic chest pain, and pericarditis. Coronary artery dissection would present with chest pain and ECG abnormalities, but not necessarily with heart failure symptoms and a new murmur."

The patient had recent cardiac catheterization and angioplasty, which puts him at risk for complications such as papillary muscle rupture. Symptoms such as shortness of breath, diaphoresis, crackles in lungs, and a new holosystolic murmur at the cardiac apex are consistent with papillary muscle rupture. Ventricular septal rupture typically presents with a loud holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. Postmyocardial infarction syndrome is a rare complication and would not cause the findings in this patient. Coronary artery dissection may cause myocardial infarction but is less likely to cause the specific symptoms and exam findings in this case."

The most likely cause of these symptoms is papillary muscle rupture, which can occur as a complication of myocardial infarction and can lead to mitral regurgitation.
