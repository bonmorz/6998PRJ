Option (C) is the correct answer as medical errors should be disclosed to patients, and their families if the patient is a minor, in order to promote transparency, trust, and informed decision-making. It is important to apologize and take responsibility for the mistake, provide information about the error, its potential impact, and any steps taken to prevent future errors. Option (A) is incorrect because there is no hospital policy that prohibits a resident from disclosing an error. Option (B) is unacceptable as it involves asking a patient to keep a secret from their parents. Option (D) is incorrect because even if there was no lasting harm, it is important to disclose the error as it is a matter of patient safety and trust."

Option A, not disclosing the error due to hospital policy, goes against ethical principles of respect for patient autonomy and informed consent. Option B, asking the patient not to tell her parents, is inappropriate and does not solve the problem. Option D, not disclosing the error because there was no harm, is also problematic since the potential harm could have been significant, and the patient and her parents have a right to know what happened. Disclosing the error to the patient and her parents is the appropriate course of action, as it provides them with information, allows them to ask questions, and may also help build trust in the healthcare provider-patient relationship. Additionally, discussing strategies to prevent similar errors in the future demonstrates accountability and commitment to patient safety."

The hospital policy may have a protocol for disclosing errors, but ultimately the responsibility falls on the healthcare provider to communicate with the patient and their family."
