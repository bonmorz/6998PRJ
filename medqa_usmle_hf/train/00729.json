The patient presents with pain in his right shoulder and difficulty lifting his right arm, indicating that there may be damage or dysfunction in the supraspinatus muscle. This muscle is innervated by the suprascapular nerve, making option (A) the most likely choice. The long thoracic nerve innervates the serratus anterior muscle, which is involved in shoulder abduction but not specifically impaired in this case. The axillary nerve innervates the deltoid muscle and the upper subscapular nerve innervates the subscapularis muscle, neither of which is specifically involved in the patient's impaired active abduction."
