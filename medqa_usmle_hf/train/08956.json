Option B is the correct answer, as insulin levels will be high and glucose levels will be low in insulinomas. C-peptide levels will also be elevated due to hypersecretion of insulin. Ketoacidosis is not present because insulinoma secretes insulin, which promotes glucose uptake and prevents ketosis."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including repeated episodes of unconsciousness, low capillary blood glucose, and the presence of a pancreatic tumor suggest insulinoma. Insulinoma is a type of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that produces excessive amounts of insulin, leading to hypoglycemia. Therefore, we can expect to see decreased glucose levels and increased insulin and C-peptide levels. Ketoacidosis is absent because insulin is suppressing ketone production. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Glucose: \u2193, Insulin: \u2191, C-Peptide: \u2191, Ketoacidosis: Absent."
