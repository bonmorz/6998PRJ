The patient's history of easy bruising suggests a bleeding disorder, and the family history of similar symptoms supports this. Hemophilia A is a genetic bleeding disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot, and is more common in males. Symptoms typically involve bleeding into deep tissues and joints, which can cause severe pain and swelling. The large bruise and swelling in the right knee following trauma are consistent with hemophilia A. Factor V Leiden is a genetic mutation that increases the risk of abnormal blood clots, and is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Homocystinuria and protein C deficiency are rare genetic disorders that can lead to abnormal blood clotting and bleeding, respectively, but are less likely based on the patient's presentation."
