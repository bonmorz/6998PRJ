The patient has a significant increase in the size of the aneurysm found incidentally last year, which indicates an increased risk of rupture.

Adjustment of cardiovascular risk factors alone is not enough, and follow-up ultrasound in 6 or 12 months is not appropriate due to the increased risk of rupture."
