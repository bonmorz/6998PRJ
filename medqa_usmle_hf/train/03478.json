However, there is no bubbling of the blood at the wound and the patient is alert and not in respiratory distress, making a needle thoracostomy less urgent. Endotracheal intubation should be performed to protect the airway in case of a tension pneumothorax or other respiratory compromise. A CT scan may be ordered after stabilization, but the immediate priority is to ensure the patient's airway and breathing are stable. Cricothyroidotomy is not indicated at this time."
