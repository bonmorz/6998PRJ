Ensuring the child's safety and involvement of law enforcement may also be necessary, but this should be done in conjunction with medical evaluation and management. Hemoglobin electrophoresis and genetic testing may be considered if there is suspicion of an inherited bleeding disorder, but these tests would not be the best initial step in evaluating this patient's presentation."
