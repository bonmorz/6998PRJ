Pretectal nuclei are also involved in pupillary reflex but damage to them would affect both eyes. Superior cervical ganglion and ciliary ganglion are not involved in pupillary reflex."

The fact that the pupils on the right side constricts when light is shone in the right eye indicates that the anterior portion of the retina in the right eye is working. Since there are no fundoscopic abnormalities, it suggests that the optic nerve is the most likely lesion site. The pretectal nuclei are responsible for the pupillary light reflex, but since the right pupil still reacts, it is less likely to be the cause. The superior cervical ganglion and ciliary ganglion are not involved in the pupillary light reflex."
