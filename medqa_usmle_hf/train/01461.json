However, we can make some assumptions based on the given information. The new drug is supposed to have a higher potency but the same efficacy as ibuprofen, with the hope of minimizing gastrointestinal side effects. This means that the new drug should be more effective at a lower dose than ibuprofen, but should have similar effectiveness overall. In terms of side effects, the new drug should ideally have fewer gastrointestinal side effects than ibuprofen. Curve A would represent a drug that has higher potency and similar efficacy as ibuprofen, which fits the scientists' specifications. Curve B may also have higher potency, but its overall efficacy is lower than ibuprofen, which does not meet the desired specifications. Curve C is ibuprofen itself and Curve D represents a drug that is less potent than ibuprofen and has lower efficacy, which is not what the scientists desire."

However, based on the given context, scientists are seeking a new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has a higher potency and the same efficacy as ibuprofen to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. The desired therapeutic effect is represented by the dashed line Y. Curve C represents the potency and efficacy of ibuprofen. Therefore, the new drug needs to have a higher potency and the same efficacy as ibuprofen, which means its potency-efficacy curve needs to shift upwards and to the left. Based on this requirement, curve A would be the best representation of the new drug."
