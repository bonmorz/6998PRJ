When the p-value is less than the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is evidence to suggest a difference between the two drugs.

Option (B) is incorrect, the p-value indicates the probability of obtaining the observed results or more extreme assuming that the null hypothesis is true, not the probability of medication 2 being superior.

Option (A) is incorrect as the trial did reach statistical significance. Option (B) is incorrect as we cannot make a statement about the superiority of medication 2 based on the given information.

Option (C) correctly states that we can fail to accept the null hypothesis. Option (D), accepting the null hypothesis, would be incorrect in this case. Option (A), stating that the trial did not reach statistical significance, is incorrect since the p-value is less than the defined significance level of 0.05. Option (B), stating there is a 0.1% chance that medication 2 is superior, is also incorrect since the conclusion was that medication 1 is more efficacious, not that medication 2 is superior."

Option (A) is incorrect because the trial did reach statistical significance with a p-value < 0.01.
