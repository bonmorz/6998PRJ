Constipation is unlikely to cause such severe urinary retention, and the presence of fluid in the bladder makes prostatic adenocarcinoma less likely.

The patient\u2019s recent use of phenylephrine for seasonal allergies, which is an alpha-adrenergic agonist, can exacerbate symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and lead to difficulty urinating. This medication-induced symptom is the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms. Constipation can also exacerbate symptoms but is not the most likely cause given the ultrasound findings of a distended bladder. Prostatic adenocarcinoma would typically present with more gradual onset of symptoms and is less likely given the patient\u2019s history of known benign prostatic hyperplasia.
