The symptoms and findings of the swelling over the maxilla, hearing loss, and elevated parathyroid hormone concentration suggest the most likely diagnosis is a parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP)-secreting tumor, which can cause hypercalcemia and bone resorption. Increased activity of nuclear factor-\u03baB is associated with PTHrP secretion in tumors. Defective synthesis of dynein is associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia.
