Albuterol can help with bronchoconstriction but is not the first choice in this case. Levofloxacin may be useful in treating bacterial infections but there is no evidence of infection in this case. Aminophylline is a bronchodilator, but O2 supplementation should be the first step in this case due to the patient\u2019s low oxygen saturation."
