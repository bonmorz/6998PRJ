This is an example of generalizability, where the medication was studied in a specific population and may not have the same efficacy and safety in different populations. The patient's poor response could be due to genetic, racial, or ethnic differences in the way the medication is metabolized and/or affected by other factors. Confounding refers to the presence of other factors that may affect the outcome and make it difficult to determine causality. Effect modification refers to a situation where the effect of an exposure on an outcome differs based on the presence or absence of another factor. Observer bias refers to the potential for the person assessing the outcome to be influenced by their own biases or expectations."

Generalizability, also known as external validity, refers to the extent to which findings can be applied to a broader population beyond the study sample.

This could be a reason for the medication's poor response in the patient. Confounding refers to a variable that is related to both the exposure and outcome and affects the observed association between them, whereas effect modification occurs when the strength or direction of an association differs according to the level of another variable. Observer bias refers to the systematic errors that occur due to the observer's perception or interpretation of the data.
