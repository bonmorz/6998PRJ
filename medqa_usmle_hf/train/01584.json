The symptoms of recurrent infections, easy bruising, hypopigmentation, and diffuse petechiae suggest a bleeding disorder. The laboratory studies results show low hemoglobin concentration, low leukocyte count, and low platelet count, which confirm the bleeding disorder. The presence of giant cytoplasmic granules in granulocytes and platelets indicate a storage disorder. Among the options, only defective lysosomal trafficking regulator gene is associated with the Chediak-Higashi syndrome, which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired lysosomal function and abnormal intracellular protein trafficking."
