Heparin is the best treatment for DVT as it is a fast-acting anticoagulant that can help prevent the blood clot from getting bigger while other medications take effect. Aspirin and ibuprofen are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that can help relieve pain but do not treat the underlying cause of DVT. Warfarin is another anticoagulant but it takes longer to start working and requires monitoring of blood levels, so it would not be a good initial treatment for this patient."
