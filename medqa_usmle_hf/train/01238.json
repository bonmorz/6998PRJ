The patient has abdominal distension and absent bowel sounds, which suggest ileus, a condition where there is a loss of peristalsis in the intestines leading to accumulation of intestinal contents. The abdominal X-ray confirms the diagnosis by showing dilated loops of bowel with air-fluid levels. Ascites would show fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity, but there is no evidence of this on physical exam or imaging. Necrotizing pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst can cause abdominal distension and elevated pancreatic enzymes, but they would not present with absent bowel sounds and the imaging findings would be different."
