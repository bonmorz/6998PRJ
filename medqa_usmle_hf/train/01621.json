The symptoms and low urinary osmolality suggest that the patient may be suffering from nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which is a potential side effect of lithium carbonate. The correct Darrow-Yannet diagram would be Image 2, which shows low urinary osmolality and high free water clearance. This indicates an inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine and leads to excessive thirst and urination."
