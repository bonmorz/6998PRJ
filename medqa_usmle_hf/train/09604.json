Option (B) may be interpreted as dismissive and could exacerbate the patient\u2019s symptoms. Option (C) is too direct and confrontational and could cause further distress to the patient. Option (D) acknowledges the patient\u2019s distress but does not address her concerns about her wrist."

Option (C) is not appropriate as it assumes the patient is having a relapse of schizophrenia without further evaluation. Option (D) is a neutral response but does not address the patient's concerns. Option (A) validates the patient's experience and allows the physician to gather more information about the symptom."
