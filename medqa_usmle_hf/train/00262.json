The question describes a viral infection, and in viral infections, infected cells present viral antigens on MHC class I molecules. MHC class I molecules consist of a heavy chain associated with \u03b22 microglobulin. Therefore, option B is the most accurate statement. Option A is incorrect since antigens are loaded onto MHC class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum, not lysosomes. Option C is incorrect since MHC class I molecules consist of one heavy chain and \u03b22 microglobulin. Option D is incorrect since MHC class I molecules are expressed by all nucleated cells, not just antigen-presenting cells."
