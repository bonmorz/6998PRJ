The fact that three protein isoforms are transcribed from the same DNA segment suggests that alternative pre-mRNA splicing is occurring, leading to the production of different protein isoforms from the same genetic code.

The observed phenomenon is most likely due to alternative pre-mRNA splicing, which is a process of creating multiple protein isoforms from a single gene by selective splicing of exons. This is supported by the fact that all three isoforms are transcribed from the same DNA segment and have varying lengths due to different inclusion/exclusion of exons. Site-specific recombination involves the exchange of DNA sequences between non-homologous sites, whereas RNA interference and post-translational protein trimming involve the regulation of gene expression and protein modification after transcription, which are not closely related to the observed phenomenon in this question."
