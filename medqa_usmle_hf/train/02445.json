Stratification, which involves dividing the study population into subgroups based on certain characteristics, can help address concerns about validity by allowing researchers to control for confounding variables and evaluate the relationship between the exposure (childhood diet) and outcome (cardiovascular disease) more accurately."

Blinding involves concealing information from study subjects or researchers to reduce bias, crossover involves switching treatment groups, and matching involves pairing subjects based on similar characteristics. While these methods can also improve study design, stratification is the most relevant option in this scenario."
