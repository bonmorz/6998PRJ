The question asks about the layer responsible for transmitting information from the gastrointestinal tract to other parts of the body. This layer is the submucosa and it contains large blood vessels and lymphatic vessels that absorb nutrients and transmit information about the contents of the gastrointestinal tract. Option A refers to the serosa, which is the outermost layer of the gastrointestinal tract that provides a protective barrier. Option B refers to the mucosa, which contains cells that primarily absorb nutrients. Option D refers to the muscularis, which contracts to generate peristaltic waves to move food through the gastrointestinal tract."

These neurons are located in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses, which are found in the muscularis externa layer of the intestine. Option (C) identifies this layer as containing large blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, which is correct. Option (B) refers to the mucosa layer which primarily absorbs nutrients, option (A) refers to the serosa layer which is connective tissue enveloping the other layers, and option (D) refers to the muscularis layer contracting for peristalsis, which are not relevant to the neurons responsible for food detection."
