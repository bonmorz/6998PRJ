The patient has undergone femoral artery embolectomy and now presents with severe pain, numbness, and tingling in the left leg. This suggests a reperfusion injury, which can occur when blood flow is restored after a period of ischemia. Deep vein thrombosis is a possibility, but the presence of weak pedal pulses on the left side suggests a more proximal problem such as reperfusion injury. Rhabdomyolysis and cholesterol embolism are not likely causes of the patient\u2019s symptoms in this scenario."

The patient's symptoms of severe pain, numbness, and tingling of the left leg and the swollen, stiff, and tender left lower extremity with weaker pedal pulses suggest reperfusion injury. While deep vein thrombosis is a possibility, the weaker pedal pulses on the left side as compared to the right side makes it less likely. Rhabdomyolysis and cholesterol embolism also have different sets of symptoms and laboratory findings."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including severe pain and numbness in the left leg, swelling and stiffness, and weaker pedal pulses, suggest reperfusion injury after the surgery. This is supported by the fact that peripheral pulses were weakly palpable post-procedure, indicating decreased blood flow to the left leg. Deep vein thrombosis and cholesterol embolism are possible causes of these symptoms, but the timing of their onset and the patient\u2019s medical history make reperfusion injury the most likely cause.
