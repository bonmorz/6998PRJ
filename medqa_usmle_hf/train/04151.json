Haloperidol, a first-generation antipsychotic, would be the most appropriate treatment for schizophrenia in a patient who is too agitated for a proper physical exam. Clozapine and quetiapine are second-generation antipsychotics and risperidone is a combination of a first-generation and a second-generation antipsychotic. These medications may be used in other patients with schizophrenia, but haloperidol is preferred in this specific case because it has a faster onset of action and is available in injectable form for when the patient cannot take medication orally."
