The observed findings are consistent with central chromatolysis, which is a reversible response of a neuron to injury or stress. This results in swelling of the neuron body, displacement of the nucleus and dispersion of Nissl bodies. Neurodegenerative changes would indicate irreversible damage, reactive astrogliosis indicates a response of astrocytes to injury or inflammation, and neuronal aging would not be seen in a young patient who had a recent snowboard accident."

Central chromatolysis is characterized by dispersion of Nissl bodies, swelling of the neuronal body, and displacement of the nucleus to the periphery, and it is commonly seen in response to axonal injury. Neurodegenerative changes are characterized by neuronal death and loss of function over time, and they are not consistent with the findings described in the question. Reactive astrogliosis refers to the process of astrocytes becoming activated in response to injury or disease, and it does not involve changes in the neuronal structure. Neuronal aging is a gradual process characterized by changes in brain structure and function over time, and it is not consistent with the acute injury described in the question. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the observed findings is central chromatolysis."
