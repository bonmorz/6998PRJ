The symptoms presented by the patient suggest a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, including the chronic respiratory infections, foul-smelling and greasy stools, and clubbing of fingers. Edema of lower extremities, jugular venous distention, hepatomegaly, and hepato-jugular reflux suggest right-sided heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy would present with a loud S4 and a harsh systolic ejection murmur. Goodpasture syndrome would have pulmonary involvement but no gastrointestinal symptoms like foul-smelling and greasy stools. Protein malnutrition would not present with respiratory symptoms, clubbing of the fingers, or S2 heart sound."
