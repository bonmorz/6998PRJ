The empirical rule states that for a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, approximately 95% falls within two standard deviations, and approximately 99.7% falls within three standard deviations. In this case, we want to find the range that includes 87% of the measurements, which is approximately 1.5 standard deviations away from the mean on either side.

Since we are looking for the range that contains approximately 87% of the measurements, we need to find the range that corresponds to 1.5 standard deviations on either side of the mean. Using the formula for z-scores, we find that a z-score of 1.5 corresponds to a value of \u00b115 from the mean. Multiplying the standard deviation by 1.5 gives us 15, so we can say that approximately 87% of the measurements will fall between 85 and 115 (the mean plus or minus 1.5 standard deviations).

We can use the standard normal distribution table to calculate the percentage of measurements falling between two limits.

For the lower limit, z = (65 - 100) / 10 = -3.5, and for the upper limit, z = (135 - 100) / 10 = 3.5. Using the normal distribution table, the percentage between -3.5 and 3.5 is approximately 99.73%. Therefore, we need to find the limits that contain approximately 87% of the measurements, which is between -1.5 and 1.5 standard deviations from the mean. For the lower limit, z = -1.5, so x = -1.5 * 10 + 100 = 85. For the upper limit, z = 1.5, so x = 1.5 * 10 + 100 = 115. Therefore, the answer is (B) 85-115."
