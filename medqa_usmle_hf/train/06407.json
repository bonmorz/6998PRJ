However, in an upside-down vertical orientation, blood will pool towards the head, resulting in an increase in blood pressure. In a horizontal orientation, there should not be much pooling of blood. Therefore, the lowest recorded blood pressure reading is expected to be in Participant A at the level of the feet. Option (C) is the correct answer."

When in a supine position with the head below the feet (as in Participant A's position), blood may pool in the head and the heart has to work harder to pump blood to the feet. This can lead to an increase in blood pressure at the level of the head and a decrease in blood pressure at the level of the feet. Similarly, when in a supine position with the head above the feet (as in Participant B's position), blood may pool in the feet and the heart has to work harder to pump blood to the head. This can lead to an increase in blood pressure at the level of the feet and a decrease in blood pressure at the level of the head. In a horizontal supine position (as in Participant C's position), blood pressure should be more evenly distributed throughout the body, although blood pressure may still vary depending on factors such as body position, hydration status, and underlying medical conditions. Therefore, the lowest recorded blood pressure reading is likely to be in Participant A's position, specifically at the level of the feet."
