In addition, the thyroid panel shows low TSH, high total T4, and high free T4, indicating hyperthyroidism. Beta-blockers are safe in pregnancy and can help manage the symptoms of palpitations and tremors. Proper hydration is also important to prevent dehydration from the vomiting. Treatment with antithyroid drugs or radioiodine should be delayed until after the first trimester as they may cause harm to the fetus."

However, since the patient is pregnant, treatment options need to be considered carefully. Beta-blockers, such as propranolol, can be used to manage symptoms while waiting for definitive treatment, such as thyroidectomy or antithyroid medications, to take effect. Propylthiouracil and methimazole are both antithyroid medications, but propylthiouracil is generally preferred in the first trimester due to a lower risk of birth defects. Iodine radioablation is not indicated during pregnancy."
