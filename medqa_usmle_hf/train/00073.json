The patient\u2019s gestational age and positive Nitrazine test suggest preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), which can increase the risk of preterm delivery and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Administration of betamethasone can help to mature the fetal lungs and decrease the risk of respiratory distress syndrome. Ampicillin is given to reduce infection risk. Cesarean section is not indicated at this time, as the fetal heart rate is reactive and there are uterine contractions, indicating that labor may progress spontaneously. Amnioinfusion may be considered in the setting of variable decelerations or umbilical cord compression, but is not necessary in this case. Induction of labor may be considered if there is evidence of fetal compromise, but is not indicated in the absence of an obstetric indication."
