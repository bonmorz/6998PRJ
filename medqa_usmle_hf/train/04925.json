The patient has a burning and aching pain along the bottom of his foot that sometimes turns to numbness, and taking time off from training does not improve his symptoms, indicating more of a nerve issue rather than a soft tissue or bone issue. The fact that the patient is currently experiencing numbness/tingling along the plantar surface of his foot further supports this diagnosis. Common fibular nerve compression would cause pain and weakness in the lower leg and foot, while herniated disc would have additional symptoms such as back pain or leg pain.

The fact that taking time off from training does not improve his symptoms also points to tarsal tunnel syndrome rather than a muscular injury.
