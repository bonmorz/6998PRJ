The patient presents with signs of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), including a shortened left leg and a clunking sound with abduction of the left hip. Ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for diagnosing DDH in infants, and early detection and treatment is important to prevent long-term complications such as arthritis and hip dysplasia. Observation with follow-up in 6 months is not appropriate given the presence of significant findings. Ultrasound of the lumbosacral spine is not indicated as there are no signs of spinal cord abnormalities present. X-ray of the hips may be used in older children but is not recommended as the initial imaging modality due to high radiation exposure."

The shortened left leg, asymmetry of labial skin folds, and positive Barlow and Ortolani tests suggest DDH. The most appropriate next step in management is an ultrasound of the hips. Observation with follow-up in 6 months is not appropriate due to the risk of worsening DDH. X-ray of the hips is not the best choice for a 4-week-old infant due to the risk of radiation exposure. Ultrasound of the lumbosacral spine may be considered if suspicion for a spinal abnormality is raised but is not the most appropriate next step for DDH."
