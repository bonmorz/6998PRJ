Exercise and diet are the best initial treatment to improve insulin resistance and decrease the risk of further complications. Adjusting the dose of levothyroxine is not relevant to the patient\u2019s presentation as his thyroid-stimulating hormone level is within the normal range. Cyproheptadine is not indicated as it is used to treat conditions such as allergic reactions and migraines. Surgical excision may be considered in cases where acanthosis nigricans is causing significant cosmetic concerns, but it is not the best initial treatment in this case."

The patient's symptoms and history suggest Acanthosis Nigricans, which is often associated with insulin resistance and obesity. The best initial treatment for this patient is exercise and diet to promote weight loss and improve insulin sensitivity. Adjusting the dose of levothyroxine may be necessary, but it is not the most appropriate initial treatment for this condition. Cyproheptadine is used in the treatment of serotonin syndrome and other conditions but is not indicated for Acanthosis Nigricans. Surgical excision may be considered in severe cases or if the condition is causing discomfort, but it is not the best initial treatment."

The darkening of the skin on the neck is likely acanthosis nigricans, which is associated with insulin resistance and obesity. The high fasting blood glucose indicates prediabetes or diabetes, and the patient\u2019s obesity and hypothyroidism can contribute to insulin resistance. Therefore, exercise and diet are the best initial treatment options to address the underlying insulin resistance and promote weight loss. Adjusting the dose of levothyroxine is unlikely to be helpful as the patient\u2019s thyroid function is already well-controlled. Cyproheptadine is used to treat conditions such as allergies and serotonin syndrome, and surgical excision is not appropriate for acanthosis nigricans."
