The biopsy described prominent nucleoli and eosinophilic cytoplasm, which are characteristic of clear-cell carcinoma. Collecting duct carcinoma and papillary carcinoma involve a different part of the kidney than the one described in the patient. On the other hand, oncocytic carcinoma is a rare type of renal cell carcinoma that doesn't match the histological findings presented in the biopsy."

Collecting duct carcinoma is rare and presents with hematuria, and papillary carcinoma is less likely due to the large size of the mass.
