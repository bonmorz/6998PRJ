From the results, the absolute risk reduction for the primary endpoint (death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia) is 0.023 (1.7% vs. 3.5%). Therefore, 1/0.023 = 43.5, which rounded up gives an answer of (C) 44. This means that 44 patients need to be treated with eplerenone to prevent one death or hospitalization from cardiovascular events."
