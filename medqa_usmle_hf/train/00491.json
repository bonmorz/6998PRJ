The history of chronic hepatitis C infection and frothy urine suggest that the patient may have nephrotic syndrome, which can cause edema.

Decreased blood urea nitrogen and decreased cystatin C are not characteristic of nephrotic syndrome. Increased antithrombin III may be seen in patients with thrombosis, which is not a typical complication of nephrotic syndrome."
