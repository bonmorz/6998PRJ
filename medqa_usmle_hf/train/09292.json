In the endogenous pathway of antigen presentation, antigens are generated in the cytosol by the breaking down of intracellular pathogens, and then translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum via TAP proteins for assembly with MHC class I molecules. Therefore, the critical step in this pathway for the virus model presented above is translocation of the antigen into the endoplasmic reticulum via TAP proteins. Option A refers to the exogenous pathway, while options C and D are related to MHC class II presentation, which is not relevant in this case."
