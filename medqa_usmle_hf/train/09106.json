Mannitol is the most commonly used substance to measure the volume of the extracellular body fluid. It increases the osmolality of extracellular fluid and diffuses through the cell membrane slowly, so it remains mostly in the extracellular space. The other options do not have specific uses for measuring extracellular body fluid."
