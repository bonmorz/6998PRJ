The patient\u2019s symptoms, including severe headaches, palpitations, profuse sweating, and hypertension, suggest a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Phenoxybenzamine is the first medication given to treat this condition, as it is an alpha-adrenergic blocker that helps to reduce hypertension and control symptoms. Pilocarpine is used to treat xerostomia, prazosin is an alpha-1 blocker used to treat hypertension, and propranolol is a beta-blocker used to treat hypertension and tachycardia, but these medications are not the first choice for treating pheochromocytoma."

Pilocarpine and prazosin are not indicated for the treatment of pheochromocytoma. Propanolol may be used to control symptoms such as palpitations, but should be administered only after alpha-blockade has been achieved to prevent unopposed alpha stimulation."
