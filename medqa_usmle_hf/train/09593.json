One of the common side effects of long-term use of albuterol is cholelithiasis, which can cause abdominal cramps and nausea. Therefore, the most likely side effect of the medication used to manage her condition is cholelithiasis. The sudden erythematous, warm face and wheezing at the end of the examination suggest an acute allergic reaction to something in the clinic."
