The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest that the most likely underlying mechanism is an increased rate of bone remodeling, which is associated with osteoporosis and Paget's disease. Proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow is associated with multiple myeloma, but the laboratory findings do not support this diagnosis. Defective bone matrix mineralization is associated with osteomalacia, which typically presents with diffuse bone pain and weakness, not localized hip and back pain. Metastatic destruction of the bone is associated with cancer and typically presents with widespread pain and other systemic symptoms."
