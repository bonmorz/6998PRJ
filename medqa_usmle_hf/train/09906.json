The patient's history of sinusitis suggests the possibility of bacterial meningitis, and the symptoms of confusion and photophobia support this diagnosis. The most commonly used empirical treatment for bacterial meningitis is a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin like ceftriaxone and vancomycin to cover for resistant organisms like pneumococci. Option C includes ampicillin for Listeria coverage, but this is less likely given the patient's age and lack of immunocompromised status. MRI of the head may be helpful in identifying structural abnormalities but is not the first-line approach in managing patients with suspected meningitis."
