The fact that a greater proportion of participants dropped out of the lifestyle modification group raises concern for attrition bias. This means that the difference in weight loss between the two groups may not be solely attributed to the intervention, as those who dropped out may have had different characteristics or experiences compared to those who completed the study. Option A, error in randomization, is unlikely given that the participants were randomized. Nonresponse bias refers to differences in characteristics between participants who respond to the intervention and those who do not, but this is not the primary concern in this scenario. Confounding bias refers to the presence of a variable not accounted for in the study that may influence the outcome, but there is no indication for this in the given information."
