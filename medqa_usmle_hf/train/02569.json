The patient has chronic abdominal pain and a history of severe peptic ulcer disease and esophagitis, which suggest a possible duodenal ulcer. The elevated fasting gastrin levels and the PET-CT with Ga-Dotatate confirm the diagnosis of a duodenal gastrinoma. The most appropriate next step in management is surgical resection. Adjuvant therapy with octreotide may be used if there is residual or metastatic disease after surgery. Biological therapy with interferon-alpha is not typically used to treat gastrinomas. Smoking cessation is important for overall health but is not a treatment for gastrinomas."
