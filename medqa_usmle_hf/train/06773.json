The patient's symptoms suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), as evidenced by thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT and PTT, and elevated D-dimer. The active bleeding from all IV and venipuncture sites, as well as the significant erythema and swelling of the posterior aspect of the left leg, further supports this diagnosis. Antiphospholipid syndrome and Factor VIII inhibitor are more specific causes of coagulopathy and are less likely in this patient. Vitamin K deficiency can cause coagulopathy but is less likely in a patient who takes aspirin and oxycontin, both of which can increase bleeding risk."

The patient has signs and symptoms of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a serious disorder that causes abnormal clotting and bleeding.

Antiphospholipid syndrome can cause venous thrombosis but is less likely to cause bleeding. Factor VIII inhibitor is a rare autoimmune disorder that causes excessive bleeding. Vitamin K deficiency leads to impaired clotting, but it\u2019s unlikely given that the patient is receiving aspirin, which does not affect vitamin K levels."
