The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest acute gout, which is characterized by sudden onset of severe pain and swelling in a joint, elevated white blood cell count, and the presence of urate crystals in synovial fluid. The negative culture rules out septic arthritis. While chronic gout is a possibility, the sudden onset of symptoms and lack of previous episodes make acute gout the more likely diagnosis. Reactive arthritis is less likely given the absence of preceding infections or gastrointestinal symptoms."

Reactive arthritis is usually associated with a preceding infection (such as with Chlamydia trachomatis) and would not account for the synovial fluid findings. The patient\u2019s history of heavy alcohol use may also contribute to the development of gout. Treatment for acute gout includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or colchicine to relieve pain and inflammation."
