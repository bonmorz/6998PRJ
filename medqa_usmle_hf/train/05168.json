First, we calculate the incidence of RSV in each group: 13/520 = 2.5% for the new vaccine group and 30/480 = 6.3% for the standard of care group. Then, we calculate the absolute risk reduction by subtracting the incidence in the new vaccine group from the incidence in the standard of care group: 6.3% - 2.5% = 3.75%. Therefore, the answer is (C)."
