His stool appears pale and his urine is very dark, indicating an obstructive pattern of jaundice. Abdominal ultrasonography shows dilation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and a cystic mass in the subhepatic region. These findings are most consistent with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Choledocholithiasis and cholecystitis can cause obstructive jaundice as well, but the additional findings of a cystic mass and weight loss make pancreatic adenocarcinoma more likely. Alcoholic hepatitis would result in elevated AST and ALT levels, but the patient's levels are within normal limits."
