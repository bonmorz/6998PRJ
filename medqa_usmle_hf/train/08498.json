The patient is likely suffering from Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder affecting the thyroid, which can cause symptoms such as tremor, weight loss, protruding eyeballs (exophthalmos), and a heard bruit over the anterior neck. Treatment with a radioactive tracer (radioactive iodine-131) works by being taken up by the thyroid gland, where it emits radiation that destroys the gland and reduces hormone production. This process is dependent on the activity of transmembrane carriers, which transport iodine into the thyroid gland.
