The mechanism of injury and the symptoms present suggest that the most likely structure damaged is the anterior cruciate ligament. The twisting motion during the cutting move would put stress on the anterior cruciate ligament, leading to its rupture or partial tear. The other options are less likely to be involved in this type of injury."

The mechanism of injury (plant and rotate outward with knee buckling inward) is consistent with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.
