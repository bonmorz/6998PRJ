The patient has symptoms suggestive of peripheral neuropathy, nodules, and non-blanching erythematous lesions on both shins, which are characteristic of Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The laboratory values show an elevated white blood cell count with a high percentage of eosinophils, suggesting an eosinophilic disorder. Goodpasture syndrome and Granulomatosis with polyangiitis are less likely based on the clinical presentation. Excessive glucocorticoid use is not a diagnosis, but a potential cause of the patient's symptoms."

The patient is presenting with neurological and dermatological symptoms, as well as fever and elevated white blood cell count with eosinophilia. The tender subcutaneous nodules, non-blanching erythematous lesions on shins, and impaired dorsiflexion of the foot suggest vasculitis. Among the options, only Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome) is associated with asthma, subcutaneous nodules, and skin lesions, as well as systemic vasculitis with multi-organ involvement. The elevated creatinine and proteinuria suggest potential renal involvement. Glucocorticoid use can cause similar symptoms, but the patient's recent onset and lack of history of excessive use make it unlikely. Goodpasture syndrome is characterized by glomerulonephritis and lung hemorrhage, which are not evident in this patient. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis can present with similar symptoms, but typically has a different pattern of organ involvement and does not have marked eosinophilia."

Additionally, the laboratory studies reveal an elevated leukocyte count with a significant eosinophilia, proteinuria, and elevated creatinine. All of these findings suggest Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as Churg-Strauss Syndrome."

The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of peripheral neuropathy, pulmonary and skin involvement, and a high percentage of eosinophils in the blood. These are all characteristic of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome). The laboratory results also show elevated creatinine and protein in urine, indicating renal involvement. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis may also present similarly but with a different type of white blood cell predominance (primarily neutrophils) and without a high percentage of eosinophils. Goodpasture syndrome is another possibility, but it typically presents with pulmonary and renal involvement without skin and peripheral nerve involvement. Excessive glucocorticoid use would not explain the constellation of symptoms and laboratory findings."
