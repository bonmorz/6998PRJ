Sphingomyelin storage disease can cause hepatosplenomegaly and neurologic symptoms, but it is not associated with cataracts or hypoglycemia. Uric acid levels can be elevated in various metabolic disorders but are not specific to any particular one. Branched-chain amino acids are elevated in maple syrup urine disease, which can present similarly to galactosemia, but the presence of cataracts and hypoglycemia suggests a diagnosis of galactosemia."
