IL-12 is known for promoting cell-mediated immune response by inducing differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th1 cells, which secrete cytokines that activate macrophages and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Therefore, option (C) is correct. Options (A), (B), and (D) are not related to the function of IL-12. Granzymes are proteases released by cytotoxic T cells, B cells are activated by cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-21, and response to extracellular pathogens is usually mediated by antibodies produced by B cells."

Interleukin-12 plays a critical role in the activation of CD4+ T cells and stimulates the differentiation of Th1 cells, which mediate cell-mediated immune responses. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). Granzymes are released by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells to induce apoptosis of target cells, while B cells are activated by IL-4 and IL-5. IL-17 is responsible for the immune response to extracellular pathogens."
