Option C, orderly rows of monomorphic cells that do not stain with E-cadherin, is characteristic of lobular carcinoma. Option D, infiltration of ductal cells blocking the dermal lymphatics, is seen in inflammatory breast cancer. Option B, disorganized nests of glandular cells with surrounding fibrosis, is characteristic of invasive ductal carcinoma."
