The patient has a history of hypertension and a systolic murmur along the right sternal border that radiates to the carotids, which suggests carotid artery disease. The loss of vision in one eye is a sign of amaurosis fugax, which can be caused by transient ischemic attacks. Therefore, the next best step in management is an ultrasound of the neck to evaluate for carotid artery disease, which can be a risk factor for stroke. Tissue plasminogen activator is used in the acute management of ischemic stroke. MRI is useful for detecting brainstem or cerebellar stroke, but this patient's CT scan did not show any significant findings. Heparin bridge to warfarin is used for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves, but this patient did not have any atrial fibrillation or valvular disease mentioned in the question stem."
