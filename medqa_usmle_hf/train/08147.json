The patient has symptoms of knee joint inflammation (swollen, warm, tender to touch) and laboratory investigation shows an elevated ESR, which suggests inflammation in the body.

X-ray may not show much in the early stages of inflammatory arthritis, and ibuprofen alone may not be effective enough in managing the symptoms. Flucloxacillin is an antibiotic and is not indicated in the management of inflammatory arthritis."
