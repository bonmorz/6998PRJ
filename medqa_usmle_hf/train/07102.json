This leads to a higher prevalence of the disease in that population. Gene flow refers to the transfer of genes between different populations, while imprinting and natural selection are not directly related to this particular genetic phenomenon."

The increased prevalence of a disease in a specific population is often due to a founder effect, which is the reduced genetic diversity that results when a population is descended from a small number of ancestors.

The reduced genetic diversity can increase the chance of passing on rare genetic disorders.
