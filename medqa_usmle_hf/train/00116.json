Anemia of chronic disease is a type of anemia that is commonly seen in patients with chronic inflammation or certain chronic conditions, such as cancer or diabetes. The lab values typically show decreased serum iron and transferrin, and increased ferritin, as iron is sequestered in the reticuloendothelial system due to inflammation. The serum transferrin receptor may be normal or low. Among the options, only (A) fits this pattern of lab values."
