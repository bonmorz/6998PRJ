This can result in a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin D, leading to osteomalacia. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer. Encephalopathy, ophthalmoplegia, and gait ataxia are associated with thiamine deficiency, which is common in alcoholics but not the cause of this patient's abdominal pain. Microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency, and megaloblastic anemia is associated with vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, which are not the cause of this patient's symptoms."
