The subcutaneous nodules, joint pain, and mitral regurgitation are classic signs of rheumatic fever, a complication of untreated or inadequately treated streptococcal pharyngitis. The ASO titer is elevated, indicating recent exposure to streptococcus. Rheumatic fever is a type II hypersensitivity reaction, in which antibodies directed against streptococcal antigens cross-react with normal host tissues, causing inflammation and tissue damage."
