The patient's symptoms, including gross blood and fever, indicate that the most likely diagnosis is infectious diarrhea. The patient's medical history of HIV suggests that he is immunocompromised, making him more susceptible to certain infections. Intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions are suggestive of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, which is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients. Flask-shaped amebic ulcers are suggestive of Entamoeba histolytica infection, but this is less common in the United States. Loosely adherent inflammatory exudates are suggestive of Clostridium difficile infection, but the presence of gross blood suggests otherwise. Non-caseating granulomas are suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease, but the patient's symptoms are more indicative of an infectious etiology. Therefore, the most likely finding on colonoscopy with tissue biopsy is intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions, indicating CMV infection."

Intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions are characteristic of cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, which is common in HIV-infected patients with low CD4 counts. Flask-shaped amebic ulcers suggest Entamoeba histolytica infection, which is less common in the US. Loosely adherent inflammatory exudates suggest shigellosis, which can also cause bloody diarrhea.
