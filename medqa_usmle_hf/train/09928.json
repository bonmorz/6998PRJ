The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), a condition where the immune system destroys red blood cells. Glucocorticoid administration, such as prednisone, is the standard of care for AIHA to suppress the immune system and reduce red blood cell destruction. Avoidance of fava beans is relevant for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Chronic blood transfusions would not address the underlying condition of AIHA and could lead to iron overload. Vitamin supplementation is not indicated for the treatment of AIHA."
