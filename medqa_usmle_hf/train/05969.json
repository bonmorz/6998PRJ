Kinesin transports vesicles from the cell body to the synapse, while dynein transports vesicles from the synapse back to the cell body. Since the neurotoxin stopped movement of vesicles from the cell body down the axon but not the movement from the synapse back to the cell body, it is likely inhibiting kinesin. Tetanospasmin and botulinum toxin affect synaptobrevin and other proteins involved in neurotransmitter release but not kinesin or dynein. Alpha/beta tubulin is involved in microtubule formation and maintenance and not directly involved in vesicle transport."

Therefore, the fact that the vesicles stopped moving down the axon but still moved back to the cell body suggests that kinesin is affected. Synaptobrevin is a protein involved in the fusion of vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, while alpha/beta tubulin are structural proteins that make up microtubules, which are involved in transporting vesicles.

The neurotoxin prevented the movement of synaptic vesicles down the axon, which suggests that it affects a protein involved in vesicle transport. Kinesin is a protein that moves vesicles and other cargo along microtubules in axons towards the synapse, and its inhibition could explain the observed effects. Dynein moves cargo in the opposite direction (towards the cell body), but the observation that movement back to the cell body still occurred suggests that dynein is not affected by the neurotoxin. Synaptobrevin is a protein present in synaptic vesicles that is involved in the fusion of the vesicle membrane with the presynaptic membrane, and alpha/beta tubulin are components of microtubules themselves. Neither of these proteins is directly involved in vesicle transport, so they are less likely to be affected by the neurotoxin in this experiment."

The movement of vesicles from the cell body down the axon is mediated by kinesin motor proteins which move along microtubules. Since the neurotoxin prevented this movement, the most likely protein affected would be kinesin. Dynein moves vesicles in the opposite direction towards the cell body, so it is not affected. Tetanus toxin and botulinum toxin affect the proteins involved in vesicle exocytosis, not vesicle transport, so they would not exhibit the same behavior as this unknown neurotoxin. Synaptobrevin is a membrane protein involved in vesicle exocytosis but is not responsible for vesicle transport along the axon. Alpha/Beta tubulin are components of microtubules and play a role in vesicle transport, but they are not the target of this neurotoxin."

Tetanospasmin and botulinum toxin affect different proteins and do not cause similar effects. Synaptobrevin is not a motor protein but rather a protein involved in vesicle fusion at the synapse.
