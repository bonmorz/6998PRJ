As such, the most appropriate initial step is to obtain a chest x-ray to rule out active tuberculosis.

Administering isoniazid for 9 months is the treatment for latent tuberculosis, but active tuberculosis needs to be ruled out first. Collecting a sputum sample for culture is necessary if active tuberculosis is confirmed."
