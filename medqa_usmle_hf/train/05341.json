The high-output cardiac failure, tachycardia and bounding pulse can be attributed to the increased cardiac output due to thiamine deficiency. Alcoholics are commonly thiamine deficient due to poor nutrition and impaired absorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause megaloblastic anemia and neurological symptoms, Niacin deficiency can cause Pellagra, and Riboflavin deficiency can cause glossitis, cheilosis and ocular symptoms."
