The patient\u2019s history of hypertension and alcohol abuse put him at increased risk for cerebral small vessel disease, which can cause lacunar infarcts and weakness of one limb. Lipohyalinosis is a subtype of cerebral small vessel disease and is the most likely cause of his symptoms. Berry aneurysm rupture would present with severe headache and subarachnoid hemorrhage, while bridging vein tear would present with rapid onset of neurological symptoms after a head injury.
