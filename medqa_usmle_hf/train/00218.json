Ultraviolet radiation, especially UVB rays, can cause DNA damage by forming thymidine dimers, which lead to intrastrand cross-linking of thymidine residues. This results in mutations that, over time, can accumulate and lead to development of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Option B is related to cell cycle regulation, while option C is related to immune response and inflammation. Option D is also related to DNA damage, but it is caused by reactive oxygen species, which are not the primary mechanism of DNA damage in UVB radiation."
