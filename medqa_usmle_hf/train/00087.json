Option B is correct because as heart rate increases, diastole, which is the resting or filling phase of the cardiac cycle, becomes shorter relative to the systole, which is the contracting phase, leading to a decreased amount of time spent in diastole. This can result in decreased myocardial perfusion, causing chest tightness or angina. Option A is false because increasing heart rate decreases the amount of time spent in each cardiac cycle. Option C is false because perfusion of the myocardium primarily takes place during diastole when the coronary arteries are filled with blood.
