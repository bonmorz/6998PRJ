The patient's LDL-C is elevated and his 10-year risk of CVD is high, so the most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy is to add a statin, such as atorvastatin, to lower his LDL-C levels and reduce his risk of CVD. Fenofibrate is a fibrate used to lower triglycerides and raise HDL-C, but it is not indicated in this patient since his HDL-C is not markedly low and his primary lipid abnormality is elevated LDL-C. Liraglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist used to treat type 2 diabetes and may have cardiovascular benefits, but it is not indicated as initial therapy for lipid management. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker used to treat hypertension and reduce heart rate, but it is not indicated for lipid management."
