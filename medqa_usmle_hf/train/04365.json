The patient\u2019s symptoms, including purulent discharge, heavy bleeding, discomfort with urination, and fever, suggest an infection, most likely endometritis. The best next step in management would be to start antibiotics that cover both aerobic and anaerobic organisms, such as clindamycin and gentamicin. Urinalysis and urine culture would be helpful as well, but the patient\u2019s symptoms are more suggestive of an intrauterine infection rather than a urinary tract infection. Endometrial culture may also be helpful, but treatment should not be delayed until test results are available. Ceftriaxone, which was used to treat pyelonephritis during pregnancy, may not provide adequate anaerobic coverage for the current infection."
