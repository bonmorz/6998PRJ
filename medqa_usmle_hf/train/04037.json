The sudden onset of vaginal bleeding, intense abdominopelvic pain, uterine contractions, and positive for a firm and tender uterus suggest placenta abruption. The fetal heart rate monitoring also shows prolonged and repetitive decelerations, which are commonly associated with placenta abruption. Immediate evaluation is necessary to detect fetal distress and maternal hemorrhage. Delaying vaginal examination is recommended until a quick sonographic evaluation is completed to ensure fetal safety."

Delaying the vaginal examination until a quick sonographic evaluation is completed is necessary to prevent further harm to the fetus. A vaginal examination can increase the risk of maternal and fetal distress in cases of placental abruption. Placenta previa is usually painless, and the uterus is soft and non-tender. Vasa previa can cause sudden fetal heart rate decelerations, but there is no mention of vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, or uterine contractions. Uterine rupture is usually accompanied by severe, sudden abdominal pain and may cause vaginal bleeding, but there is no mention of fetal heart rate abnormalities in the question stem."

The patient is experiencing vaginal bleeding, abdominopelvic pain, uterine contractions, and a positive abdominal examination for a firm and tender uterus. The fetal heart rate is also abnormal. These symptoms suggest placenta abruption, which is a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention to prevent potential harm to both the mother and the fetus. The attending physician warns against a vaginal exam until a quick sonographic evaluation is completed to avoid further harm. Vasa previa, uterine rupture, and placenta previa can also cause vaginal bleeding and fetal distress, but they present differently from placenta abruption."

The sudden onset of vaginal bleeding, intense abdominopelvic pain and uterine contractions are suggestive of placental abruption. The firm and tender uterus on abdominal examination supports this diagnosis, as does the fetal heart rate abnormalities detected on the cardiotocographic evaluation. The physician warns about delaying a vaginal physical exam until a sonographic evaluation is completed, as this could potentially worsen the abruption and harm the fetus. Vasa previa is associated with painless vaginal bleeding, and placenta previa does not typically present with intense pain and contractions. Uterine rupture can present with similar symptoms but is typically more common in women who have had prior uterine surgery or trauma."
