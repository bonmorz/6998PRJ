The patient\u2019s symptoms, including unilateral purulent discharge mixed with blood, indicate that the most likely diagnosis is foreign body obstruction rather than the other options. Septal perforation may cause a bloody discharge, but it is usually bilateral and occurs due to chronic nasal irritation. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is more commonly associated with cervical lymphadenopathy and unilateral middle ear effusion. Sinusitis with bacterial superinfection is a possibility, but foreign body obstruction should be ruled out first due to the nature of the discharge."
