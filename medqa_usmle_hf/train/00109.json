The arterial blood gas shows a low pH and low bicarbonate levels, confirming metabolic acidosis. The high anion gap indicates an anion gap metabolic acidosis, which could be caused by diabetic ketoacidosis. The elevated potassium levels are likely due to acidosis causing movement of potassium from intracellular to extracellular fluid. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) the patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis with decreased total body potassium."

The anion gap is not given in the question, but it is stated that the patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis. The elevated potassium level (5.6) and low bicarbonate level (12) are also consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis, which can occur in patients with uncontrolled Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus who binge drink alcohol. The respiratory rate (24) is elevated, suggesting some compensatory respiratory alkalosis, but it is not the primary disorder in this case. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer."
