The use of combined oral contraceptives can cause inhibition of hormones in the pituitary gland, leading to decreased TSH production and subsequent hyperthyroidism. Option (B) is incorrect because the hypothalamus is responsible for releasing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release TSH. Option (C) is incorrect because this is a mechanism of action for the progestin component of combined oral contraceptives, not the estrogen component. Option (D) is incorrect because this is a mechanism of action for progestins, not estrogens."
