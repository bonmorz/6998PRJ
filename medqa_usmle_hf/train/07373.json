The newborn exhibits several characteristic findings of Trisomy 18, such as micrognathia, prominent occiput, pointy low-set ears, small palpebral fissures, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, widely spaced nipples, and prominent heels and rounded soles. The holosystolic murmur may indicate a ventricular septal defect, which is commonly associated with Trisomy 18. Fetal alcohol syndrome may present with some similar findings, but it is less likely given the absence of a maternal history of alcohol use. Deletion of Chromosome 5p may present with a different constellation of features, such as a high-pitched cry and intellectual disability. Trisomy 13 may also present with overlapping fingers and other abnormalities, but the specific combination of findings seen in this case is more consistent with Trisomy 18."

This genetic disorder is characterized by micrognathia, prominent occiput, small palpebral fissures, clenched fists, overlapping fingers, widely spaced nipples, and cardiac defects. Fetal alcohol syndrome may also present with some similar findings, but is less likely in this case given the absence of maternal alcohol use and the specific combination of physical findings. Deletion of Chromosome 5p is associated with Cri-du-chat syndrome, which has different physical findings. Trisomy 13, also known as Patau Syndrome, may present with similar cardiac defects, but typically has different craniofacial abnormalities and polydactyly."

The combination of micrognathia, prominent occiput, pointy low-set ears, upward slanting eyes with small palpebral fissures, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and widely spaced nipples are all characteristic of Trisomy 18. The 3/6 holosystolic murmur, prominent heels, and convex, rounded soles are also associated with Trisomy 18. Fetal alcohol syndrome typically presents with growth deficiency, specific facial features, and CNS abnormalities. Deletion of Chromosome 5p (Cri-du-chat syndrome) presents with a high-pitched cry, microcephaly, and prominent epicanthal folds.

The holosystolic murmur may be due to ventriculoseptal defect, which is a common finding in Trisomy 18. Deletion of Chromosome 5p would present with a high-pitched cry and severe developmental delay, while Fetal Alcohol Syndrome would have distinct facial abnormalities but not the same pattern as this case. Trisomy 13 would also have distinct physical abnormalities, including polydactyly and cleft lip/palate."

Trisomy 13 also presents with similar physical findings, but a cleft lip and palate is more common than micrognathia. Fetal alcohol syndrome may have similar physical findings but is usually associated with growth restriction and characteristic facial features such as small eye openings and a smooth philtrum. Deletion of chromosome 5p may cause cri-du-chat syndrome, which typically presents with a high-pitched cat-like cry and severe intellectual disability, but the physical findings are different."
