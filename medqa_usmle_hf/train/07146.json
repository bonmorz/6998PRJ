The history of alcoholism, elevated liver enzymes, and suicide note suggest acute liver failure secondary to toxic hepatitis. Glutathione is a crucial antioxidant and plays a key role in detoxification, the most common treatment for toxic hepatitis is N-acetylcysteine, which is a glutathione substitute. Heavy metal chelator is used to treat heavy metal poisoning, GABA receptor competitive antagonist is used for alcohol withdrawal, and competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase is used for methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning, but none of these apply to this patient."
