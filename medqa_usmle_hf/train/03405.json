The fact that the new pump is already being compared to insulin injection therapy suggests that it has already gone through preclinical testing, Phase 1 (safety and tolerability), and Phase 2 (efficacy and dose range). Phase 3 studies involve larger groups of participants and compare the new treatment to standard treatment or placebo. Therefore, this new pump is most likely in Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 4 studies involve post-marketing surveillance and monitoring of long-term effects after the treatment has been approved and is widely available. Phase 0 studies involve a small number of participants and investigate drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics."
