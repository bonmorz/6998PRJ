Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis would show a diffuse linear pattern of IgG and C3 deposition. HIV infection can cause a variety of renal diseases, but specific immunofluorescence findings are not typically diagnostic for it."

The presence of granular IgA deposits in the glomerular mesangium is characteristic of Berger\u2019s disease (IgA nephropathy).

Lipoid nephrosis is also known as minimal change disease, which is not associated with IgA deposits. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is caused by deposition of immune complexes that contain streptococcal antigens, not IgA.
