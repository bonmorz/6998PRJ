Increased arterial pH and increased serum ketones are not typical findings in shock. Decreased hemoglobin may be seen in cases of bleeding, but the question states that there is no sign of blood loss."

The patient is in acute shock, which is often associated with tissue hypoxia and anaerobic metabolism, leading to lactic acidosis. Therefore, the most likely laboratory finding will be increased blood lactate. Option A is incorrect because shock is associated with acidosis, not alkalosis. Option B is incorrect because increased serum ketones are associated with diabetic ketoacidosis or starvation, not acute shock. Option C is incorrect because decreased hemoglobin is a sign of anemia, which may contribute to shock, but is not a laboratory finding commonly associated with shock."

Shock is a life-threatening medical emergency caused by insufficient blood flow throughout the body, and can cause tissue damage and organ failure. Blood lactate levels increase rapidly during shock due to tissue hypoxia and anaerobic metabolism. Therefore, in this patient, increased blood lactate levels would be expected in laboratory investigation. Option A is incorrect because shock leads to decreased arterial pH (acidosis). Option B is unlikely in this scenario as ketones are typically found in conditions such as diabetes and alcoholism. Option C is also less likely as there are no signs of blood loss, and the patient's decreased blood pressure suggests decreased blood volume rather than decreased red blood cell count."

This can cause an increase in blood lactate levels, as cells switch to anaerobic metabolism to produce energy. Therefore, the correct answer is (D). Increased arterial pH (A) and increased serum ketones (B) are not typical findings in acute shock. Decreased hemoglobin (C) may be seen in cases of acute blood loss, but there is no evidence of blood loss in this scenario."
