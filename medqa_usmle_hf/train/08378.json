The symptoms, including poor feeding, oral thrush, and skin lesions, suggest a yeast infection, most likely caused by Candida albicans. Defective beta-2 integrin is associated with leukocyte adhesion deficiency, which increases susceptibility to infections by Candida and other opportunistic pathogens, and can present with symptoms similar to those of the patient. Defective tyrosine kinase is associated with severe combined immunodeficiency, defective microtubules are associated with Chediak-Higashi syndrome, and defective actin cytoskeleton is associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, all of which can also lead to increased susceptibility to infections, but their symptoms and laboratory results are different from those of the patient."
