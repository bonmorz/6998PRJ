The question describes a phenomenon called reassortment or genetic shift, where the genomes of two different viruses mix within an infected cell. When the virus containing genome X surrounded by the nucleocapsid of Y infects another cell, the most likely outcome is that virions containing genome X and nucleocapsid X will be produced, as the genome and nucleocapsid of the same virus are more likely to match up and be packaged together."
