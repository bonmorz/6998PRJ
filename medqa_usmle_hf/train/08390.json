In the absence of documentation of blood refusal, the patient\u2019s life takes precedence over the husband\u2019s wishes. Consulting the hospital ethics committee can be helpful, but not urgent in this life-threatening situation. Waiting to assess the patient\u2019s mental status can result in further delay in treatment, which can be detrimental to the patient\u2019s condition. Therefore, administering blood products is the most appropriate next step in management."

With the lack of any documented refusal of blood products by the patient, the most appropriate next step is to administer blood products to save the patient\u2019s life. It is important that the patient receives urgent care despite the religious objection to blood products, and ethical considerations can also be consulted as needed. As a language model AI, our responses do not replace the diagnosis and treatment plans of professional physicians. Therefore, it is always good to seek professional medical advice when uncertain about any medical decisions."
