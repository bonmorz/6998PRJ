The presence of blood in the initial stream of urine (initial hematuria) and the absence of dysuria suggests that the most likely origin of the hematuria is the urethra, possibly due to injury during the recent ureteric colic episode. Glomerular hematuria would typically have RBC casts present in urine microscopy, while hematuria originating from the renal pelvis or urinary bladder would have a more constant presence of blood in the urine."
