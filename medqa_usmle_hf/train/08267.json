The pale, swollen proximal convoluted tubules suggest acute tubular necrosis, which is often caused by ischemia or toxic injury.

Cytoplasmic triglyceride accumulation can cause fatty liver, double-stranded DNA breakage can lead to genetic mutations, and free radical formation can cause oxidative damage, but these mechanisms do not fit the given findings."
