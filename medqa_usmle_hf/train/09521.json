The patient has recently given birth, and the symptoms suggest mastitis, which is an infection of the breast tissue commonly caused by bacteria from the baby's mouth. Breastfeeding is the best next step as it helps to empty the breast and clear the infection. Breast pumping may also be helpful in addition to breastfeeding. Antibiotics such as oxacillin or vancomycin may be necessary if the infection does not improve with breastfeeding or if there are signs of systemic infection. However, antibiotics should not be the first-line treatment and should be reserved for severe cases."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest lactation mastitis, which is commonly caused by milk stasis from poor breastfeeding technique or unsuccessful transfer of milk. The best next step in management would be to initiate breastfeeding, as this helps to alleviate milk stasis and reduce the risk of infection. Breast pumping may also be helpful, but breastfeeding directly is preferred. Antibiotics such as oxacillin or vancomycin would only be necessary if there was evidence of a bacterial infection."
