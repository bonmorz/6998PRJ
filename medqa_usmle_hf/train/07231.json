The patient\u2019s history of taking an oral medication and recent start of omeprazole for reflux suggests that the medication may be inhibiting the process of oxidation, which is the main pathway by which many drugs are metabolized and eliminated from the body. This inhibition may lead to increased levels of the medication in the bloodstream, which can increase the risk of bleeding and bruising. Acetylation, filtration, and glucuronidation are not typically affected by omeprazole."
