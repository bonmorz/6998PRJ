The fact that the wife's grandfather \"cannot see the color red\" suggests he has red-green color blindness, which is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder. Males only have one X chromosome, so if they inherit the allele for red-green color blindness, they will exhibit the phenotype of the disorder. Therefore, males affected by this condition are hemizygous, meaning they only have one copy of the gene, and exhibit full penetrance, meaning they will always exhibit the phenotype if they inherit the gene. The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the inheritance pattern or phenotype of males affected by this condition."

Males inherit one X chromosome from their mother and one Y chromosome from their father, so if the mother is a carrier, there is a 50% chance her son will inherit the condition and will exhibit full penetrance since they only have one X chromosome. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) hemizygous; full penetrance."
