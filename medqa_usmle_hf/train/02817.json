The symptoms described match the classic clinical presentation of Hurler\u2019s syndrome, which is caused by a deficiency in alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme. This deficiency causes an accumulation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate, leading to the clinical manifestations described. Hunter\u2019s syndrome is also caused by a deficiency in an enzyme that breaks down glycosaminoglycans, but it presents differently with fewer skeletal abnormalities and no corneal clouding. Gaucher\u2019s disease and Fabry\u2019s disease are caused by deficiencies in different enzymes altogether, and their clinical presentations are different from what is described."
