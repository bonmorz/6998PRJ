Acute graft-versus-host disease would occur in bone marrow or stem cell transplant recipients and this patient did not show any skin abnormalities.

Chronic graft rejection is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's clinical history and the microscopic findings, which are consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), a common manifestation of chronic graft rejection in lung transplant recipients.

Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a complication of bone marrow transplantation, not lung transplantation. Acute graft rejection usually presents as acute hypoxemia and is less likely more than a few months post-transplant."
