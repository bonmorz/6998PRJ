Digoxin is used to treat atrial fibrillation and heart failure, but recent studies have shown that it does not improve long-term survival in patients with heart failure. Captopril, on the other hand, has been shown to improve long-term survival in patients with heart failure. Therefore, it would be more beneficial to continue captopril and discontinue digoxin. Option (A) is incorrect because digoxin can still be used in patients with systolic dysfunction and sinus rhythm. Option (B) is incorrect because digoxin can still benefit patients with left-sided heart failure in the presence of atrial fibrillation. Option (D) is incorrect because while digoxin does have potential side effects, the decision to discontinue it was based on its lack of proven long-term benefit, not its side effects."
