Repeat chest CT scan in 6 months is a reasonable next step to monitor the nodule and determine if any changes occur. Other options may be considered in the future if needed."

A PET scan or sputum cytology may be considered if the nodule grows or the patient develops symptoms, but they are not the initial recommended step. An abdominal CT scan is not indicated unless there are specific symptoms or findings to suggest metastasis."
