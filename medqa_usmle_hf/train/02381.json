The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest rhabdomyolysis, which can be caused by certain medications like statins that inhibit HMG-CoA reductase enzyme, leading to decreased production of mevalonic acid. Therefore, the medication that was most likely started and caused the rhabdomyolysis inhibits the enzyme that produces mevalonic acid. Option C is the correct answer."

The patient\u2019s symptoms and family history suggest that she may have coronary artery disease, and she was likely started on a statin medication such as atorvastatin, which inhibits the HMG-CoA enzyme. However, the symptoms and high creatine kinase level suggest that she may be experiencing statin-induced myopathy. Mevalonic acid is an intermediate in the HMG-CoA pathway, and specifically inhibiting this intermediate with alendronate has been shown to cause myopathy in some patients."
