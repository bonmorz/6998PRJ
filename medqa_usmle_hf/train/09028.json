The disorder is a recessive genetic disorder, meaning the child must inherit two copies of the defective gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. The probability that the woman is a carrier is 2/200 (1/100 for each chromosome), and the chance of her passing on the gene to her child is 1/4. Therefore, the probability of the child inheriting the gene from the mother is 1/800, and the probability of the child inheriting two copies of the gene (and therefore developing the disease) is 1/16 x 1/800 = 1/12,800.

The disorder mentioned in the question is likely Friedreich ataxia, which has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. The carrier frequency in the general population is 1/100 or 0.01. The chance of both parents being carriers is 0.01*0.01 = 0.0001 or 1/10,000. The chance of the child inheriting the disease is 25% or 1/4, since each parent has a 50% chance of passing on the carrier allele and both alleles must be present for the disease to manifest. Therefore, the probability that the child will develop the disease is 0.0001*0.25 or 0.000025. This can be simplified to 1/40,000 or answer choice (C)."

This means that both parents must be carriers of the gene mutation for their child to inherit the disease. The chance of an unaffected carrier (heterozygous for the gene mutation) passing on the mutation to their child is 1/4. Therefore, the probability of the child inheriting the disease is (1/100) x (1/4) = 1/400. However, since the couple is unaffected, there are two possible carriers (one for each parent), which doubles the chance of the child inheriting the disease to 1/200. Finally, because the population is assumed to be in steady state without selection, the prevalence of the disease in the population is equal to the carrier frequency squared, which is (1/100)^2 = 1/10,000. Therefore, the probability that her child will develop the disease is 1/200 x 1/10,000 = 1/40,000. Answer choice (C) is correct."
