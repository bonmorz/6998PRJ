The patient's symptoms suggest that he may be malingering, as there is no clear medical explanation for such severe symptoms with no physical findings. Brachial neuritis is an inflammation of the brachial plexus, but reflexes would not be normal in that case. Factitious disorder is when a person fabricates symptoms consciously or unconsciously, but it doesn't explain the sudden onset without any prior history. Radial nerve palsy doesn't explain the lack of sensation in addition to the muscle weakness."

The normal reflexes and withdrawal response to the pin prick test suggest that there is no actual physical impairment. Further evaluation and history-taking may be needed to confirm or rule out this diagnosis."

The patient presents with symptoms of right arm pain and inability to move the arm, along with 1/5 muscle strength, no sensation to light touch over the entire right arm and forearm, and a positive pin prick test. These symptoms suggest that the patient may be malingering, which means that he is intentionally faking or exaggerating his symptoms for some external gain, such as financial compensation or attention. Brachial neuritis and radial nerve palsy may cause symptoms similar to those described by the patient but they would not present with the same combination of symptoms. Factitious disorder is a psychological condition in which a person deliberately produces or exaggerates physical or psychological symptoms in order to assume the role of a sick person. However, in this case, the symptoms appear to be intentionally feigned rather than being due to a psychological condition."

All other options are unlikely based on the given information. Brachial neuritis would present with acute onset of pain followed by rapid muscle weakness, but the sensation loss is inconsistent with this diagnosis. Factitious disorder is characterized by physical or psychological symptoms that are intentionally produced or feigned to assume the sick role, but in this case, the patient is not producing symptoms for personal gain. Radial nerve palsy would present with weakness in the muscles controlled by the radial nerve and sensory loss in the upper limb, but the rapid withdrawal of the arm on pin prick testing is inconsistent with this diagnosis."

The presentation with severe pain and inability to move the right arm, along with the lack of sensation, suggests a neurological problem. Factitious disorder and malingering both involve feigning or exaggerating symptoms, but the lack of any obvious external motive for this patient suggests they are not appropriate diagnoses. Brachial neuritis involves sudden onset of shoulder pain followed by weakness, but does not typically cause full paralysis and lack of sensation. The most likely diagnosis, based on the symptoms, is Radial nerve palsy."

The symptoms of the patient suggest Malingering, as there is no clinical evidence of any underlying injury or illness and the patient's behavior seems motivated by external factors such as financial stress. Brachial neuritis can cause weakness, sensory loss, and pain, but it usually affects both arms and is not typically associated with isolated weakness and sensory loss in one arm. Factitious disorder is unlikely as there is no evidence of self-inflicted injury, and radial nerve palsy is unlikely as it would not typically cause such severe sensory loss."
