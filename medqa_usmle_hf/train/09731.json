The symptoms, including the recurrent episodes of pain, weight loss, and low-grade fevers, suggest a possible diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematous (SLE). The laboratory findings of anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia further support this diagnosis. Positive anti-dsDNA antibodies are a common finding in patients with SLE. Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies are associated with rheumatoid arthritis, while a positive monospot test is indicative of infectious mononucleosis. Elevated serum IgA levels are often seen in patients with multiple myeloma, celiac disease, and other conditions, but do not fit the clinical picture in this case."
