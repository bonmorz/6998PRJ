The description of the mass as pedunculated with well-demarcated borders is characteristic of an endometrial polyp, which is a common cause of intermenstrual bleeding. Endometrial carcinoma may present with bleeding, but the features described here are not consistent with that diagnosis. Adenomyosis is a condition in which the endometrium grows into the myometrium and causes heavy bleeding and painful periods. Endometrial hyperplasia is an overgrowth of the endometrium that can lead to abnormal bleeding, but it is not usually pedunculated."
