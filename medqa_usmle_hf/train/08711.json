The arrow points to a section of the heart that shows vacuolization of the myocardium, which is a sign of lipid accumulation. The most likely cause for this is oxidation of phospholipid molecules, which can occur in conditions such as ischemia, myocarditis, and myocardial infarction. Accumulation of iron granules is seen in conditions like hemochromatosis, clumping of defective mitochondria is seen in conditions like mitochondrial myopathies, and aggregation of alpha-synuclein is seen in conditions like Parkinson\u2019s disease. These conditions do not fit with the patient\u2019s presentation or autopsy findings."
