The CBC results are consistent with anemia, which is common in cases of scurvy. Vitamin K deficiency is unlikely, as all clotting tests are normal. Vitamin B12 and B3 deficiencies would not explain the specific symptoms seen in this case."

The anemia is normocytic and normochromic, further supporting the diagnosis of scurvy rather than a deficiency in Vitamin B12 or B3, which would cause macrocytic anemia."
