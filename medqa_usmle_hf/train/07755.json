The patient shows signs and symptoms of sickle cell anemia, which is caused by a genetic mutation that replaces glutamate with lysine in the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin. Option A refers to glutathione metabolism, which is not related to sickle cell anemia. Option C suggests reduced production of beta-globin, but sickle cell anemia is characterized by abnormal beta-globin. Option D refers to a mutation in a different gene that is not associated with sickle cell anemia."
