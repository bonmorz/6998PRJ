The symptoms and test results suggest acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which is characterized by the presence of blast cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. The presence of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and petechial bleeding are all common manifestations of ALL. The mediastinal mass seen on chest radiograph could represent an enlarged thymus or lymphoma, which are both commonly seen in children with ALL."
