Thumb flexion is controlled by the median nerve, not the ulnar nerve, so the patient would be able to perform that action. Finger crossing and shoulder abduction are controlled by the axillary and radial nerves, respectively, which are not affected by this fracture. Finger extension is controlled by the radial nerve, which might be affected since it is close to the location of the fracture, but the question specifically asks for an action that the patient would be unable to perform, and most patients with radial nerve palsy can still extend their fingers."
