Option A, CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast, may delay surgical intervention. Option C, obtaining a retrograde urethrogram, is not necessary at this time as there are no signs of injury to the urinary tract. Option D, performing a diagnostic peritoneal lavage, can be helpful in evaluating intra-abdominal bleeding, but it is not as definitive as exploratory laparotomy."
