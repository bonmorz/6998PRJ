The symptoms and findings described are characteristic of Niemann-Pick disease type A, a lysosomal storage disease that results in hepatosplenomegaly, failure to thrive, pancytopenia, progressive neurological deterioration, and cherry-red spots on the macula. Elevated transaminases, a reticulonodular pattern and calcified nodules on chest X-ray, and foamy histiocytes on liver biopsy are all consistent with this diagnosis. Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I is a congenital disorder characterized by severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, Gilbert syndrome is a benign condition characterized by elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin, and Gaucher disease is another lysosomal storage disease, but it often presents with bone pain and fractures rather than hepatosplenomegaly."
