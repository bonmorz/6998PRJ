Superficial swabs are not recommended due to poor sensitivity and specificity. Endovascular intervention or minor amputation may be necessary if the patient does not respond to conservative therapy."

Superficial swabs may be useful to guide antibiotic therapy, but antibiotics should not be delayed while waiting for the results.
