The elevated pulse and reflexes are also characteristic of hyperthyroidism. The lab values suggest a low TSH level, high free T4 level, and high free T3 level, which are all indicative of hyperthyroidism. The normal level of Thyroxine-binding globulin rules out option C, and the high free T4 level rules out option D. Option B has a normal TSH level, which is not consistent with hyperthyroidism."

The patient presents with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which include palpitations, anxiety, weight loss, fine tremors, and hyperreflexia. The most likely laboratory values on evaluation would be a decrease in TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) due to negative feedback from high levels of thyroid hormones, an increase in free T4 (thyroxine) due to overproduction, and an increase in free T3 (triiodothyronine) due to conversion from excess T4. Thyroxine-binding globulin levels may be normal. Therefore, the correct answer is (A)."
