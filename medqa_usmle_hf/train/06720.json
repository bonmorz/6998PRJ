The patient's symptoms include delusions, disorganized speech, and flat affect, which are indicative of psychotic disorders. While brief psychotic disorder can present with similar symptoms, it is characterized by symptoms lasting less than one month. Schizophreniform disorder presents with symptoms lasting between 1 to 6 months, which fits the patient's 3-month history. Schizoid personality disorder is characterized by social withdrawal and lack of emotional expression, but not psychotic symptoms. Schizotypal personality disorder can present with odd thinking and eccentric behavior, but not necessarily delusions or hallucinations. Therefore, Schizophreniform disorder is the most likely diagnosis for this patient."
