The patient was prescribed a drug that irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and 2 and is likely aspirin, which can cause bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma. Therefore, the therapy for primary prevention of coronary artery disease should be switched to a drug with a different mechanism of action, such as Blockage of P2Y12 component of ADP receptors. This is because this drug, such as clopidogrel, is a platelet aggregation inhibitor and can reduce the risk of blood clot formation in coronary arteries."

The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with an allergic reaction to the new medication, likely aspirin or another NSAID, given his history of chronic rhinosinusitis and asthma. Therefore, primary prevention of coronary artery disease should be switched to a drug that does not inhibit cyclooxygenase enzymes like aspirin or NSAIDs. Blockage of P2Y12 component of ADP receptors (option A) is a mechanism used by antiplatelet drugs like clopidogrel, which would be a good alternative in this case. Direct inhibition of Factor Xa (option B) is a mechanism used by anticoagulant drugs like rivaroxaban, which is not appropriate for this situation. Sequestration of Ca2+ ions (option C) is a mechanism used by calcium channel blockers like verapamil, which are not indicated for primary prevention of coronary artery disease. Potentiation of antithrombin III (option D) is a mechanism used by anticoagulant drugs like heparin, which is not appropriate for this situation."

Among the options, only blockage of P2Y12 component of ADP receptors (aspirin) is not related to inhibition of cyclooxygenase."
