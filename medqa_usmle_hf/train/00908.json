The patient's symptoms suggest lumbar spinal stenosis or disc herniation, and an MRI of the lumbosacral spine is the best next step in management to confirm the diagnosis. An ankle-brachial index is used to assess peripheral arterial disease, which is not likely the cause of the patient's symptoms based on the normal pulses. Naproxen is a pain reliever and does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Radiography of the lumbosacral spine may show bony changes, but an MRI is better for evaluating soft tissues such as herniated discs."

The symptoms suggest the possibility of spinal stenosis, a condition where the spinal canal narrows and compresses the spinal cord and nerve roots.

Ankle-brachial index is used to assess peripheral arterial disease, which is not consistent with the symptoms presented. Naproxen is a pain reliever and does not address the underlying cause of the symptoms. Radiography of the lumbosacral spine has poor sensitivity and specificity for detecting spinal stenosis."
