He is able to stack cubes, kick a ball, play with other children, and draw quietly alongside his sister, indicating fine and gross motor skills, social development, and the ability to focus on an activity. His vocabulary of 200 words, use of \"I\" sentences, and apparent understanding of instructions indicate language development. The increased tantrums may be a normal part of behavior for a child his age. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) None."
