Sotalol is a beta-blocker with Class III antiarrhythmic properties, meaning that it prolongs both the repolarization and AP duration of cardiac cells. However, its main therapeutic effect is to decrease AV nodal conduction, making it useful for treating supraventricular tachycardias. Therefore, the most likely physiologic effect of sotalol in this patient is to decrease AV nodal conduction and restore normal sinus rhythm."
