The multi-protein complex at the apical aspect of epithelial cells that provides a diffusion barrier between the apical and basolateral aspects of epithelial cells is called the tight junction. Claudin is a protein that is a major component of tight junctions and is responsible for regulating the permeability of the epithelial barrier. Therefore, the researcher is most likely investigating Claudin. Integrin is a transmembrane protein that connects the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, connexon is a protein that forms gap junctions to allow for direct communication between adjacent cells, and desmoglein is a protein that forms desmosomes to provide mechanical strength between adjacent cells."
