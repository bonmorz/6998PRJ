The patient's symptoms suggest acute cholecystitis, and initial management typically involves NPO (nothing by mouth), IV fluids, analgesics, and antibiotics. Cholecystectomy (surgical removal of the gallbladder) is the definitive treatment, but the timing depends on the severity of the patient's condition. In mild cases, surgery may be delayed up to 72 hours to allow for resolution of inflammation and improvement in the patient's overall condition before proceeding with surgery. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer. Options (B) and (C) have more specific time frames for surgery which may not be necessary or advisable, and option (A) does not address the potential need for cholecystectomy."

In this case, the patient should undergo cholescystecomy within 72 hours as her symptoms are not severe. Option B is incorrect because there is no indication for urgent surgery. Option C may be too late for surgery, as delaying surgery for more than 48 hours may increase the risk of complications."
