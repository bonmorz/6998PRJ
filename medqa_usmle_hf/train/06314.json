Failure of the mesonephric duct to degenerate would lead to the presence of male reproductive organs. The absence of a uterus and presence of ovaries suggests failure of the paramesonephric duct to form properly during fetal development, which is the likely pathophysiology underlying this condition."

The presentation of primary amenorrhea with no cervix and a shortened vaginal canal suggests that there was a failure of the paramesonephric duct to form, which leads to the development of the uterus, cervix, and upper one-third of the vagina in females. Failure of the mesonephric duct to degenerate can result in development of cystic structures in the vagina, while failure of the ovaries to produce estrogen can lead to delayed puberty or secondary amenorrhea.
