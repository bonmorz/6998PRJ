The presence of micrognathia, cleft lip, and cleft palate, along with downward slanting eyes and malformed ears, point towards Treacher Collins Syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in the TCOF1 gene. Trisomy 18 may also present with similar craniofacial abnormalities, but the presence of a normal APGAR score and no signs of cyanosis or heart murmur make it less likely. Mutations in the SOX9 gene can cause skeletal abnormalities and sex reversal syndromes, but not specifically craniofacial abnormalities. Microdeletion at chromosome 22q14 can cause DiGeorge Syndrome, which is associated with cardiac abnormalities and immune deficiency, not specifically craniofacial abnormalities."

The symptoms described in the question (micrognathia, cleft lip, cleft palate, downward slanting eyes, malformed ears) are highly suggestive of Treacher Collins syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in the TCOF1 gene. Trisomy 18 is associated with multiple congenital anomalies, including a small jaw, cleft lip and palate, and ear abnormalities. Mutation of the SOX9 gene is associated with campomelic dysplasia, which involves skeletal abnormalities and respiratory distress. Microdeletion at chromosome 22q14 is associated with DiGeorge syndrome, which involves abnormalities of the thymus, parathyroid gland, and heart.  So, option (D) is the most likely cause in this scenario."
