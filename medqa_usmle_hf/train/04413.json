Respiratory burst relies on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which requires reducing factors such as NADPH. The pentose phosphate pathway generates NADPH, and ribose-5-phosphate is an intermediate in this pathway, synthesized from fructose-6-phosphate. Therefore, the increased production of ribose-5-phosphate from fructose-6-phosphate is most likely to be present in these cells to generate enough reducing factor for respiratory burst."

The question is asking about which metabolic pathway may be affected in cells that are unable to generate enough reducing factor for respiratory burst. One of the key enzymes involved in respiratory burst is NADPH oxidase, which requires NADPH as a reducing factor. Ribose-5-phosphate is a precursor for the synthesis of NADPH via the pentose phosphate pathway, so increased production of ribose-5-phosphate from fructose-6-phosphate may help increase NADPH levels and improve respiratory burst function. The other options are not directly related to NADPH synthesis or respiratory burst."

The question is asking which substance is most likely to be present in cells that are unable to generate enough reducing factor for respiratory burst. Ribose-5-phosphate is a precursor for the nucleotide synthesis of RNA and DNA, and it is produced from fructose-6-phosphate via the pentose phosphate pathway. This pathway generates reducing power in the form of NADPH, which is required for respiratory burst in immune cells. Therefore, increased production of ribose-5-phosphate may be present in these cells to compensate for the lack of NADPH.
