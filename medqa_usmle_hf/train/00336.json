The shooting pain and decreased sensitivity are both indicative of nerve compression, while the passive leg raise test is commonly used to diagnose herniated discs. Inflammatory degeneration of the spine or compromised vertebral body integrity would not cause sciatica, while an inflammatory reaction in the epidural space may cause pain but would not present with the other symptoms described."
