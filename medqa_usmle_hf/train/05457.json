The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which can cause hyperprolactinemia and lead to milky discharge from the breasts. The low progesterone level also supports this diagnosis. The absence of breast masses, pain, or skin changes makes malignancy unlikely. The next step in management is to provide reassurance to the patient and recommend avoidance of nipple stimulation, which can exacerbate the discharge. Imaging studies are not necessary unless there are additional symptoms or findings on physical examination."

The serum prolactin level is normal, however, and prolactinomas are rare in this age group. Other common causes of galactorrhea include medications such as propranolol, as well as thyroid dysfunction. Given that the patient has hypothyroidism, it is likely that this is the cause. A reassuring talk to the patient to avoid nipple stimulation will be adequate at this point, as further investigations are not necessary."

The patient\u2019s history and physical examination are unremarkable except for the milky discharge from both breasts, which suggests hyperprolactinemia. The serum prolactin level is only slightly elevated, and the other laboratory findings are within normal limits, indicating that the discharge is unlikely to be caused by a breast mass or a pregnancy. Galactography, mammography, and ultrasound imaging are indicated if there is a palpable mass or if the discharge is bloody, but they are not necessary in this case. Treatment with dopamine agonists may be considered if the discharge is bothersome or if the prolactin level remains elevated, but reassurance and advice to avoid nipple stimulation are appropriate as initial measures."
