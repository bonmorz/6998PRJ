The patient\u2019s symptoms of itchiness and joint pain are consistent with an allergic reaction to TMP-SMX, which can cause a type III hypersensitivity reaction. This type of reaction involves antibody-antigen complexes depositing near the basement membrane of the glomerulus, leading to inflammation and damage. Complement protein C3 is involved in the inflammatory response, and levels are typically lowered in type III hypersensitivity reactions. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Lowered serum levels of complement protein C3."

The symptoms described in the question suggest an allergic reaction to TMP-SMX, and the serological finding expected with this presentation is lowered serum levels of complement protein C3. This is because complement proteins are activated during an allergic reaction and can be consumed, leading to lowered serum levels.
