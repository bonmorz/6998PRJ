The elevated AST and ALT suggest liver dysfunction, which can be caused by medication toxicity. The patient drinks alcohol, but the laboratory abnormalities are more likely due to medication toxicity than alcohol use alone. There is no evidence of bacterial or viral infection based on the laboratory results. Therefore, the best explanation for the abnormal laboratory values is medication toxicity."

The patient drinks 2 alcoholic beverages every night, but her liver function tests are only mildly elevated, making alcohol less likely as the cause of the abnormal laboratory values. Bacterial or viral infections may cause abnormal laboratory values, but there are no clear indicators of infection in this patient's history or physical exam. Medication is the most likely cause of the elevated AST and ALT levels. The patient is on oral contraceptive pills, which can cause liver enzyme elevation as a rare side effect. It is important for the physician to follow up with the patient and potentially adjust her medication regimen."
