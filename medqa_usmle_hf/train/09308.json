The laboratory findings are all within normal range except for the thyroid-stimulating hormone, which is slightly elevate. The drug prescribed increases norepinephrine nerve stimulation, which would suggest that it is an antidepressant medication. Clonidine and phenylephrine are not commonly used as antidepressants, while lithium is used to treat bipolar disorder, not depression. Therefore, the most likely answer is venlafaxine, which is an SNRI antidepressant that increases norepinephrine and serotonin levels. The side effects listed are common with venlafaxine use."
