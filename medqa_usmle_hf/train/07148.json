Pulmonic stenosis is the narrowing of the pulmonary valve or pulmonary artery and can lead to increased resistance to flow and right ventricular hypertrophy. This can cause hypoxemia, which is worsened by stress, such as when the patient became upset when his toy was taken away. The degree of pulmonic stenosis is the best predictor of the degree of hypoxemia and cyanosis. The degree of RVH and the degree to which the aorta overrides the right ventricle are also important factors in this patient's clinical presentation, but they are not the best predictors of hypoxemia and cyanosis. The presence of S3 is not relevant to this patient's presentation."

RVH and the degree to which the aorta overrides the right ventricle can also contribute to hypoxia, but they are not as significant as pulmonic stenosis.
