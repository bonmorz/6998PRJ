The woman\u2019s serum test results show that she has acute hepatitis A, and her child\u2019s immunizations are up-to-date. Hepatitis A is typically spread through contaminated food and water, and it is unlikely that the child has been exposed to the virus through his mother\u2019s sickness. Therefore, no additional steps are needed for the child at this time. Option A is incorrect because the child has already received the hepatitis B vaccine and administering the immunoglobulin is not necessary. Option C is incorrect as it is not necessary to administer hepatitis B immunoglobulin in this case. Option D is incorrect because the child has not been exposed to hepatitis A and does not need the vaccine or immunoglobulin."
