                "content": "We use the z-score equation: z = (x - mean)/standard deviation. Plugging in the values, we get z = (22-14)/4 = 2. Therefore, we need to find the area to the right of z = 2 on a normal distribution. Using a z-table or a calculator, we find that the area is about 0.0228. Multiplying this by the total sample size of 500,000 gives us 11,400. However, we want to include the area to the right of z = 2, which means we also need to include the area of exactly z = 2. This area is very small, but we will round up to include it. Adding these two values gives us a total of approximately 12,500 participants with scores greater than 22, which corresponds to answer choice (A)."
