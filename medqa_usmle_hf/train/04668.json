The patient has sepsis, which increases the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and the slow bleeding suggests DIC.

Option A and D are incorrect as they both have normal D-dimer levels, which would not be the case in DIC. Option C is also incorrect as platelet counts are typically low in DIC."

Normal D-dimer, elevated fibrinogen, and elevated platelet count indicate uncompensated hypercoagulability. Elevated D-dimer and normal fibrinogen and platelet count indicate an acute thromboembolic event. Negative D-dimer, normal fibrinogen, and normal platelet count indicate no significant coagulation dysfunction."
