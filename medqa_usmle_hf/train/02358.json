The white, hard fingers and toes indicate frostbite. The most appropriate next step is to warm the patient with intravenous administration of warmed normal saline. This can help increase body temperature and prevent further cold-induced injuries. Intravenous administration of diltiazem (A) is not indicated for this patient since he has low blood pressure and bradycardia. Application of heating pads (B) may cause more harm than good since they can burn the skin or cause rewarming shock. Emergent electrical cardioversion (D) is not indicated since the patient\u2019s atrial fibrillation is likely due to his hypothermic state rather than a cardiac problem."

The patient is likely suffering from severe hypothermia, evident from their fixed dilated pupils and low body temperature. The priority is to warm the patient by providing IV administration of warmed normal saline, as this will improve cardiovascular stability and decrease shivering. Neither diltiazem nor cardioversion is appropriate in this situation. Application of heating pads to the extremities is not the immediate priority and may cause excessive vasodilation, leading to further cold exposure injury or unstable cardiovascular function."
