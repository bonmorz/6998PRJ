The symptoms described in the question point towards peripheral vertigo, which is caused by issues with the vestibular system. The fact that the rotatory nystagmus stops with visual fixation also suggests peripheral vertigo. The nerve that exits the skull at the internal auditory meatus is the vestibulocochlear nerve, which is responsible for the vestibular system and can cause vertigo and tinnitus when damaged. Therefore, the answer is (D)."
