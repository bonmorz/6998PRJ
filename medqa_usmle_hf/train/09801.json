The patient recently returned from Liberia and is presenting with symptoms indicative of a highly infectious disease, including fever, muscle pain, fatigue, and a sore throat, with the development of a nonproductive cough and difficulty breathing. The presence of a maculopapular rash and bilateral conjunctival injection is also noted. The laboratory test result indicates the presence of negative-sense, single-stranded linear genetic material with filaments of varying lengths, which is most similar to Marburg virus. Dengue virus causes flu-like symptoms and rash, but not conjunctival injection. Lassa fever virus causes a fever and severe muscle pain, but not a rash or conjunctival injection. Hantavirus causes fever, muscle pain, and respiratory symptoms, but not a rash or conjunctival injection."
