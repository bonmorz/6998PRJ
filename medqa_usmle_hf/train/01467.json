The patient is showing symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) due to not taking insulin, which is necessary for glucose utilization, leading the body to break down fats instead. This process produces ketones that lead to metabolic acidosis. The laboratory values that are consistent with DKA include a low pH, low bicarbonate (HCO3-), high ammonium (NH4+), and high potassium (K+), which are all found in option (A)."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which results from a lack of insulin leading to high blood glucose and the production of ketones. The laboratory values in option A would be consistent with the diagnosis of DKA, as there would be an increase in ammonium ion and a decrease in bicarbonate, as well as low pH and high potassium levels. Option B shows normal bicarbonate levels and low ammonium ion levels, which are not consistent with DKA. Option C shows high bicarbonate levels, which is not expected in DKA, as well as normal ammonium ion levels. Option D shows high ammonium ion levels, but normal bicarbonate levels, which is not consistent with DKA."
