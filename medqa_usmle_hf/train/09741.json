The wobble hypothesis states that the third position of a codon can tolerate non-standard base pairing, allowing for more flexibility in codon-anticodon recognition. In this case, the first two sequences have different third codons, which can code for different amino acids through wobble base pairing. The third sequence, however, has the same third codon as the first two, resulting in the same amino acid being produced.

The wobble hypothesis explains that a single tRNA anticodon can recognize more than one codon through non-standard base pairing in the third position. In this case, the third codon of the third sequence may be a proline codon that utilizes a tRNA anticodon that does not allow for wobble base pairing.

The wobble hypothesis states that the third nucleotide in a codon can sometimes be interchangeable, allowing for the possibility of multiple codons coding for the same amino acid. In this scenario, the third sequence (CCACCACCA) differs from the first two only in the third nucleotide, which changes from a cytosine to an adenine. This change causes the codon to now encode for a different amino acid instead of proline, demonstrating the wobble hypothesis in action."

The Wobble hypothesis states that the third base in a codon can pair with more than one base in the anticodon of tRNA, allowing for some flexibility in translation. In this scenario, the third base in the codon for the third sequence is always \"C\", which pairs with \"G\" in the anticodon of tRNA for proline, resulting in the synthesis of a string of prolines. In contrast, the first two sequences have different third bases, which allow for different anticodon-tRNA pairing and thus the synthesis of different amino acids.

The phenomenon observed in this question is explained by the wobble hypothesis, which states that the third base of a codon can often vary and still code for the same amino acid due to certain base pair interactions. In this case, the third base of the third sequence (CCA) codes for proline, which is the same amino acid coded for by the first two sequences, but the lack of variation in the sequence prevents any wobble interactions from occurring. Therefore, the resulting synthesized protein is still a string of prolines. Covalent alterations, translational proofreading, and trimming of proteins do not explain this phenomenon."
