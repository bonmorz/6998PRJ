The scars in the antecubital fossa suggest IV drug use, which puts the patient at risk for endocarditis and septic emboli.

Bacterial meningitis can also cause neurological symptoms but other symptoms such as photophobia and neck stiffness would likely be present. Intracranial hemorrhage and thromboembolic stroke can occur in IV drug users but the history and symptoms make septic emboli the most likely etiology."
