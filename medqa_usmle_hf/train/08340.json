The narrowing of the renal artery and resulting ischemia and hemorrhage of the renal parenchyma suggest that there may be renal artery stenosis leading to renal hypertension. The most likely cause of this is raised renin level in the blood, which triggers the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system leading to vasoconstriction and hypertension. Elevated C-reactive protein, cholesterol, or calcium levels are not directly related to this condition."

The autopsy findings suggest that the patient had long-standing uncontrolled hypertension, which could cause renal artery stenosis and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Therefore, the most likely answer is (D) raised renin level in the blood. Elevated C-reactive protein is associated with inflammation, while raised cholesterol is associated with atherosclerosis. Raised calcium levels are associated with various conditions such as hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D toxicity, but not with the patient\u2019s specific findings."
