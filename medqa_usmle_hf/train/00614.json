The presence of a mass in the anterior triangle of the neck indicates a possible Hodgkin's lymphoma, which is confirmed by the biopsy results. The elevated parathyroid hormone level and high calcium level suggest ectopic production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) by the lymphoma cells or production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), which can cause hypercalcemia. Therefore, option (B) Ectopic vitamin D production is the most likely explanation of the patient's laboratory findings."

Osteolytic metastasis can also cause hypercalcemia, but the biopsy results do not support this option. Multivitamin overdose is unlikely to cause these symptoms and laboratory findings. Osteoblastic metastasis can cause hypercalcemia, but it is not a likely explanation given the clinical presentation."
