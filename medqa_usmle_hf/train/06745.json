The patient's presentation is consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity, which can cause altered mental status, muscle spasms, and oxalate crystal formation in the urine. Elevated serum osmolality and anion gap metabolic acidosis with hypocalcemia are also consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity. Methanol and isopropyl alcohol toxicity can also cause similar symptoms, but the absence of ketones in the urine and the presence of oxalate crystals suggest ethylene glycol toxicity."
