The patient presents with acute onset severe diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting with tenderness to palpation in the periumbilical region, and laboratory results show an elevated lactate level, all of which suggest acute mesenteric ischemia. Lack of enhancement of the branches of the superior mesenteric artery is a characteristic finding on contrast CT of the abdomen for this condition. Option A describes small bowel obstruction, option B describes mesenteric ischemia with portal venous gas, and option D describes colonic obstruction."
