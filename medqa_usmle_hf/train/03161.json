MRI of the brain can help detect any abnormalities, but it is not the first step in management. Ultrasound of the pelvis is not indicated in this case, and serum dehydroepiandrosterone level is not specific enough for precocious puberty."

The patient presents with signs of precocious puberty, which can be caused by a number of conditions including a hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis dysfunction. The most appropriate next step in management would be a GnRH stimulation test to determine the origin of the hormone secretion and to help guide further diagnosis and treatment. An MRI of the brain may be considered if there is concern about a brain tumor or other neurological issue causing the precocious puberty, but it would not be the first step in management. Ultrasound of the pelvis and serum dehydroepiandrosterone level are not typically used in the diagnostic evaluation of precocious puberty."
