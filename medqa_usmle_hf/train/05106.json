Lack of access to sharp objects and lack of illicit drug use can also be protective but they are not mentioned in the given scenario. Though the lack of immediate family history of suicide can be a protective factor, the fact that the patient's aunt died from suicide suggests a family history of suicide, making it a risk factor rather than a protective factor."
