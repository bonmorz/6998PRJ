Amitriptyline and intravesical dimethyl sulfoxide are options for treatment, but they are not the most appropriate next step.

The patient's symptoms suggest interstitial cystitis (IC), and the negative urine cultures and small petechial hemorrhages on cystoscopy support this diagnosis. The most appropriate next step is behavior modification, including avoiding foods and beverages that may irritate the bladder, practicing bladder retraining, and reducing stress. Amitriptyline and intravesical dimethyl sulfoxide are treatment options for IC, but initial management should involve conservative measures such as behavior modification. Bladder hydrodistension is a diagnostic tool for IC but is not appropriate at this time."
