The sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath, as well as the spread of pain to the upper left arm, suggests a heart attack. The fact that the patient suddenly collapsed and was unresponsive further suggests a cardiac event. Ventricular tachycardia is a potentially lethal arrhythmia that can occur following a heart attack and can lead to cardiac arrest and sudden death. Free wall rupture, pericarditis, and atrial fibrillation are all possible complications of a heart attack but are less likely to cause sudden death as in this case."
