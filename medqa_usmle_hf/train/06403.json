If the gene for DNA helicase is knocked down, DNA cannot be unwound, which means DNA replication cannot proceed. So, the correct answer is that DNA is not unwound. Option (B) is incorrect because DNA supercoiling is usually relieved by topoisomerases, not DNA helicase. Option (C) is incorrect because the reannealing of two DNA strands occurs after replication forks have passed. Option (D) is incorrect because the RNA primer is created by primase, which is not regulated by DNA helicase."

DNA supercoiling may still occur, but it will not be resolved due to the absence of DNA helicase.
