Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a type of interstitial lung disease that involves scarring or fibrosis of the lungs, leading to a progressive decline in lung function.

Cushing\u2019s syndrome is not directly related to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and acute exposure to asbestos can cause a different type of interstitial lung disease. While smoking cessation is important for overall lung health, it does not reverse the effects of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."
