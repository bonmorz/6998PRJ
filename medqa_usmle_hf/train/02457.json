The symptoms suggest Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, which is characterized by congenital absence of the uterus and upper part (2/3) of the vagina. This is caused by agenesis of the paramesonephric duct. Deficiency of 5-alpha reductase and deficiency of 17-alpha-hydroxylase are causes of disorders of sexual development, but they would present with different symptoms. Monosomy of sex chromosomes (Turner syndrome) can also cause amenorrhea, but patients with Turner syndrome have underdeveloped ovaries and secondary sex characteristics."

The presence of normal breast development and pubic and axillary hair suggests that there is sufficient estrogen in the body. The normal ovaries and atretic uterus suggest that the cause of the patient's symptoms is agenesis of the paramesonephric duct. This means that the M\u00fcllerian ducts fail to develop properly and thus, the patient does not have a uterus or a fully formed vagina. Deficiency of 5-alpha reductase and deficiency of 17-alpha-hydroxylase would present with other symptoms like ambiguous genitalia and hormonal imbalances. Monosomy of sex chromosomes (Turner Syndrome) would present with additional symptoms like short stature, a broad chest and webbing of the neck."

The presence of pubic and axillary hair suggests normal levels of androgens, ruling out deficiency of 5-alpha reductase and deficiency of 17-alpha-hydroxylase. The absence of a uterine cavity suggests agenesis of the paramesonephric duct, which in turn leads to the failure of the development of the uterus and the upper two-thirds of vagina. Monosomy of sex chromosomes (Turner syndrome) would also present with amenorrhea, but typically with primary amenorrhea and other physical features such as short stature and wide-spaced nipples, which are not mentioned in the clinical scenario."

Deficiencies of 5-alpha reductase and 17-alpha-hydroxylase do not typically present with primary amenorrhea. Monosomy of sex chromosomes (Turner syndrome) can also cause primary amenorrhea, but the physical findings described in the question stem do not fit with this diagnosis."
