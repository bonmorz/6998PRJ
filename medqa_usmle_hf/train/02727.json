The symptoms and findings suggest that the patient has cryptococcal meningitis, which is a fungal infection of the central nervous system. The next best step in therapy is to administer amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine, which are commonly used to treat cryptococcal meningitis. Fluconazole is not as effective as the combination of amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine. Acyclovir is used to treat viral infections, which is not the cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid and can worsen fungal infections, so it is not recommended for treatment of cryptococcal meningitis."

The next best step in therapy would be to administer amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine, which are standard treatments for cryptococcal meningitis. Fluconazole alone is not sufficient for this infection, acyclovir is for herpes infections, and dexamethasone is contraindicated in fungal meningitis as it can exacerbate the infection."

Fluconazole is also an antifungal, but it is less effective against this organism. Acyclovir is an antiviral and would not be effective against fungal meningitis.
