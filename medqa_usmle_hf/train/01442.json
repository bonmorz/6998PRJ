Therefore, testing the assay in Southern California, where Lyme disease is less common, would increase the likelihood that an individual with a negative test truly does not have Lyme disease, leading to a greater negative predictive value. This would not affect the positive likelihood ratio or the likelihood of a patient without Lyme disease having a negative test."

Lyme disease is most commonly found in the Northeastern and Upper Midwestern regions of the United States, and the incidence and prevalence of this disease in these regions are different from those in Southern California. As such, testing the assay in Southern California may affect the negative predictive value of the assay (i.e., greater likelihood that an individual with a negative test will truly not have Lyme disease), as the prevalence of the disease is lower in this region. It may also affect the positive predictive value of the assay (i.e., lower likelihood that a patient without Lyme disease truly has a negative test), as the specificity of the assay may be lower in regions with different strains of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Therefore, the correct answer is (D)."

Conversely, in an area with a higher prevalence, there would be a lower likelihood of a truly negative test, which is option (B).
