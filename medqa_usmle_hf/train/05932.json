The patient\u2019s history suggests chronic alcohol and tobacco use, which are risk factors for developing pancreatic pseudocysts. The epigastric mass is also a common presenting symptom of pancreatic pseudocysts, making it the most likely diagnosis. Chronic cholecystitis can present with similar symptoms, but the presence of an epigastric mass makes pancreatic pseudocyst more likely. The other options, retroperitoneal fibrosis and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, are less likely based on the patient\u2019s symptoms and history."
