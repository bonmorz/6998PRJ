The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a possible Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is associated with high protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) without an increase in cell count. Glucose levels are typically normal. The opening pressure may be normal or high, but not low. Therefore, the most likely CSF result is normal cell count, high protein, normal glucose, and normal or high opening pressure. Option C matches these criteria. High neutrophils are not typically seen in Guillain-Barre syndrome, and high lymphocytes are more commonly seen in viral infections."

The normal sensation and intact sensation suggest that the issue is not in the sensory nerves. The most likely scenario is that the patient has Guillain-Barre Syndrome, which is a peripheral nervous system disorder. In Guillain-Barre Syndrome, the cerebrospinal fluid would display normal cell count with high protein and normal glucose but normal opening pressure. Option A, high neutrophils with low glucose, is usually seen in bacterial meningitis. Option B, high lymphocytes with normal protein and glucose, is usually seen in viral meningitis. Option D describes a normal lumbar puncture, which would not fit with these symptoms."
