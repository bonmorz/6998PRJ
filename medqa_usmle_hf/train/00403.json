The symptoms and presentation suggest meningitis, and the presence of a maculopapular rash is a characteristic of viral meningitis caused by enteroviruses such as Echovirus. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis also shows a predominance of lymphocytes, which is typical of viral meningitis. Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae are bacterial causes of meningitis, but they are less likely in this case because the cerebrospinal fluid analysis does not show a predominance of segmented neutrophils. Neisseria meningitidis is another bacterial cause of meningitis, but it typically presents with petechial or purpuric rash, and the cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows a predominance of neutrophils."
