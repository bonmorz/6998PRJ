The fixed, split S2 heart sound suggests a congenital heart defect, and among the options, only failed formation of the septum secundum can cause a condition called atrial septal defect (ASD) which can result in the blue discoloration of the hands and feet.

Failure of the ductus arteriosus to regress causes a patent ductus arteriosus, and failure of the aorticopulmonary septum to spiral leads to transposition of the great vessels."
