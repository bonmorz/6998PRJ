However, the history of travel to rural India suggests a possibility of parasitic infection, such as cholera or giardia. The decreased skin elasticity and turgor suggest dehydration, which can be exacerbated by chronic use of drugs that decrease stomach acid secretion, such as pantoprazole. Aspirin and propranolol can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, and levocetirizine is an antihistamine that is unlikely to be associated with these symptoms."
