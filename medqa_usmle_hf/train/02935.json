This suggests that it is physiological jaundice and observation is the next best step, as bilirubin levels typically peak between 3 and 5 days of age and then decline. Coombs test is used when there is suspicion of hemolytic disease of the newborn, and exchange transfusion would only be considered if the bilirubin level remains high and rising despite phototherapy and other interventions. Phototherapy is a treatment option for jaundice, but the levels do not currently warrant this intervention."
