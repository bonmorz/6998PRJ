The presence of ring-enhancing lesions on brain CT is suggestive of CNS infections, particularly those caused by protozoa. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is caused by a type of fungus, but it is not associated with ring-enhancing lesions on brain imaging. Neoplasms can also present with ring-enhancing lesions, but in this case, the patient's history of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia suggests an infectious etiology. Bacteria and viruses are less commonly associated with ring-enhancing lesions in the brain."
