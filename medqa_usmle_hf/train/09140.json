One effective way to decrease intracranial pressure is to increase the respiratory rate to decrease carbon dioxide levels in the blood. This will cause vasoconstriction of cerebral vessels and decrease cerebral blood volume, leading to a decrease in intracranial pressure. Increasing the fraction of inhaled oxygen or positive end-expiratory pressure may help with ventilation and oxygenation but will not specifically target intracranial pressure. Decreasing the heart rate is not a recommended method for decreasing intracranial pressure."
