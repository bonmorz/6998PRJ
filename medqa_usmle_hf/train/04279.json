IV tPA should be administered within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, but since the patient had a similar episode 2 months ago, the time period for administering IV tPA has already passed. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent used for secondary stroke prevention, but it is not effective for treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Mannitol is used to decrease intracranial pressure in cases of cerebral edema, but it is not indicated for treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Mechanical thrombectomy is the best course of treatment in this patient, as it is effective up to 24 hours after symptom onset and has been shown to improve outcomes in large vessel occlusions."

The exhibit shows a large left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarct, which suggests an occlusion of the M1 branch of the MCA. The best course of treatment in this patient is mechanical thrombectomy, which can remove the clot and restore blood flow to the affected area, reducing the risk of further brain damage. IV tPA can also be used in eligible patients but is less effective in large vessel occlusions like this one. Aspirin is useful for the prevention of stroke but is not effective in treating acute stroke. Mannitol is a diuretic that can reduce brain swelling but is not indicated in this patient."
