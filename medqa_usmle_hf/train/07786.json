The patient history and symptoms suggest tuberculosis, which is confirmed by the acid-fast bacilli found in the sputum. The appropriate next step in management is to immediately begin treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months. Option A is incorrect because treatment cannot be delayed while awaiting culture results, especially in a patient with symptoms of active tuberculosis. Option B is incorrect because the diagnosis has already been confirmed with the presence of acid-fast bacilli. Option C may be useful for further evaluation but is not necessary for initiating treatment."

Treatment with a combination of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months followed by isoniazid and rifampin for an additional 4 months is the standard regimen for active pulmonary TB. Awaiting culture results or performing the interferon-\u03b3 release assay, which can take several days, would delay treatment and increase the risk of transmission to others. A CT scan of the chest may be useful for evaluating complications of TB, but treatment should not be delayed while waiting for imaging results."

Option B is not necessary because the diagnosis has already been confirmed. Option C may be helpful to assess the progression of the disease, but it is not the most urgent step at this time. Option D is the correct answer because the standard treatment for TB involves a combination of four drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin alone for an additional 4 months."
