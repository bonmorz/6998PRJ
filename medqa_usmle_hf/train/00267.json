The patient's symptoms are consistent with opioid overdose, and the treatment being administered is likely naloxone, which is an opioid antagonist that acts on \u03bc-receptors. It rapidly reverses the effects of opioids, including respiratory depression and sedation. Ryanodine receptors are involved in muscle contraction, GABAA receptors are involved in the CNS, and 5-HT2A receptors are involved in serotonin signaling. None of these would be the primary target for naloxone in this scenario."
