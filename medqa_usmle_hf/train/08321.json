This means that the same mutation can have different effects on different individuals. Compound heterozygosity refers to the presence of two different mutant alleles at a particular gene locus, frameshift mutation refers to a genetic mutation caused by insertions or deletions of a number of nucleotides in a DNA sequence that is not divisible by three, and chromosomal instability refers to an increased tendency of chromosomes to break or exchange genetic material during cell division. None of these principles explain the observed differences in this pair of siblings."

This means that the severity and range of symptoms can vary between individuals, even within the same family. The sister may have a milder form of the syndrome, which does not include lens subluxation or an arched palate. Compound heterozygosity, frameshift mutation, and chromosomal instability are not relevant to Marfan syndrome."
