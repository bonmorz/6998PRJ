Carbidopa-levodopa is used to treat Parkinson's disease, which the patient does not have symptoms of.

The patient appears healthy and there are no significant findings on examination except for decreased pedal pulses and absent ankle jerk and patellar reflexes. These are likely due to peripheral vascular disease. The patient also has mild dementia, which may be related to his family history of Parkinson's disease and age. The finding that he can only recall one of three words after 5 minutes suggests some mild cognitive impairment, but it is not clear if this is due to a reversible cause such as thiamine deficiency. Given that the patient is otherwise asymptomatic and his hypertension is well-controlled with lisinopril, no further workup is required at this time."

The patient is an elderly patient with a history of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease who appears healthy but has decreased pedal pulses and absent ankle jerk and patellar reflexes. His normal muscle strength suggests that there is no upper motor neuron involvement. The intact sensation to light touch, pinprick, and proprioception also rules out a sensory neuropathy. The patient has mild dementia and difficulty with recall, suggesting some cognitive impairment, but no signs of confusion or disorientation. The most appropriate next step in management for these findings is optional, as it depends on the physician's decision. However, no further workup may be necessary as the patient's symptoms may be attributed to his known medical history and age."
