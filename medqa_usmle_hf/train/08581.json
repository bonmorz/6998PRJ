Antagonism of muscarinic M3 receptors can relax the bladder muscle and reduce these contractions, therefore it is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient. Agonism of muscarinic M2 receptors can reduce heart rate and blood pressure, which is not relevant to this patient\u2019s condition. Antagonism of beta-3 adrenergic receptors and agonism of beta-2 adrenergic receptors can increase bladder capacity, but they are not as effective as muscarinic antagonists for urge incontinence."
