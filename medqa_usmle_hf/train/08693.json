The patient\u2019s elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels, in combination with her family history, suggest a hereditary condition like Crigler-Najjar syndrome or Gilbert syndrome. Phototherapy is the first-line treatment for hyperbilirubinemia, but in severe cases like this, a plasma exchange transfusion is necessary to decrease bilirubin levels. Option C is incorrect since the patient has severe hyperbilirubinemia and needs treatment. Furosemide is a diuretic and has no effect on bilirubin levels."
