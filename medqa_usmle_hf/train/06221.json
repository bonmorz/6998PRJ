The bleeding from the nipple is most likely caused by an intraductal papilloma, which is a benign tumor that grows within the milk ducts. It is the most common cause of nipple discharge in women who are not pregnant or breastfeeding. The fact that there is no palpable mass and that the ultrasound shows a solitary mass enclosed within a dilated duct further supports this diagnosis. Invasive ductal carcinoma and papillary carcinoma are both types of breast cancer, but they typically present with a palpable mass and are not usually associated with nipple bleeding. Paget disease of the breast is a rare form of breast cancer that presents with eczematous changes around the nipple and is often associated with underlying ductal carcinoma."
