The symptoms of blurring of vision and distortion in the center when looking at an Amsler grid, along with the fundoscopic image showing drusen and pigmentary changes, suggest the most likely diagnosis is age-related macular degeneration. Hypertensive and diabetic retinopathy typically present with hemorrhages, exudates, and cotton-wool spots. Cystoid macular edema presents with a cystic lesion on fundoscopy."
