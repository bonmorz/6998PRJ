Measurement bias is the most relevant type of bias in this scenario, as the accuracy and precision of the two tests may differ and affect the results of the study. Confounding bias occurs when an extraneous factor affects the relationship between the exposure and outcome, recall bias occurs when participants may remember or report information differently based on their knowledge or beliefs, and lead-time bias occurs when an earlier diagnosis of a disease may falsely appear to lead to better outcomes due to the earlier detection, rather than actual treatment effectiveness."

Measurement bias, also known as ascertainment bias, refers to a systematic error in measurement that distorts the true association between the exposure and outcome variables. In this case, the bias may occur if the accuracy or sensitivity of the blood test or PET exam varies between the two groups of patients, leading to differential misclassification of AD status. Confounding bias refers to an extraneous variable that is associated with both the exposure and the outcome, making it difficult to attribute causality. Recall bias refers to systematic differences in the accuracy or completeness of recall of past events or experiences between groups, and lead-time bias refers to the bias that results from detecting a disease earlier by screening, which appears to prolong survival without actually affecting the course of the disease."
