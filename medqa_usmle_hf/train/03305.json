The intrasellar mass suggests a pituitary adenoma, which can cause visual disturbances, headaches, and hypopituitarism. Among the options, erectile dysfunction is commonly associated with hypopituitarism. Galactorrhea is also associated with pituitary adenomas, but it is not specific to this type of mass. Coarse facial features and abdominal striae are associated with Cushing\u2019s syndrome, which is caused by excess cortisol secretion from an adrenal mass or by long-term use of glucocorticoids. There is no indication of Cushing's syndrome in this case."

Galactorrhea is also associated with pituitary adenoma, but it occurs when the adenoma produces prolactin, which does not seem likely in this case. Coarse facial features and abdominal striae are associated with Cushing\u2019s syndrome, which is caused by adrenal gland adenoma."
