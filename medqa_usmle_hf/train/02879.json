The enlarged cardiac silhouette and narrowed mediastinum suggest an increase in blood flow to the heart due to shunting. Among the options, the most likely is a ventricular septal defect, which is a hole in the wall separating the right and left ventricles, allowing oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle to mix with oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle. This mixing results in decreased oxygen saturation and cyanosis. The holosystolic murmur heard over the left lower sternal border is consistent with this diagnosis."

The X-ray shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette with a narrowed mediastinum, which suggests that the newborn has congestive heart failure. Among the options, only Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) is associated with a holosystolic murmur heard over the left lower sternal border. VSD is a congenital heart defect in which there is a hole in the wall separating the two lower chambers of the heart. This can cause blood to flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle instead of flowing to the body. This can result in a decrease in oxygenation of blood and lead to central cyanosis."
