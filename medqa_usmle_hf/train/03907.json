The presence of atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, along with the diagnosis of follicular lymphoma and overexpression of the BCL-2 gene, suggests that the most likely cytogenetic abnormality is t(14;18)(q32;q21). This translocation is a common finding in follicular lymphoma and leads to overexpression of the BCL-2 gene, which prevents apoptosis and promotes the survival of malignant lymphocytes. The other options are associated with different types of lymphomas."
