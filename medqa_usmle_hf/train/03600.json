The symptoms described suggest intermetatarsal plantar nerve neuroma, or Morton\u2019s neuroma, which causes pain in the plantar surface of the foot and can be aggravated by wearing tight shoes. The clicking sound is also a characteristic symptom. Inflammation and damage to the plantar fascia would cause pain in the heel, while compression of the tibial nerve would cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the entire foot. Damage to the trabeculae of the calcaneus would cause heel pain and tenderness."
