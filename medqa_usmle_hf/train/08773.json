Changing the cutoff to < 115 mEq/L would increase the number of patients classified as severe hyponatremia, which would increase the specificity (true negative rate) but decrease the sensitivity (true positive rate). The negative predictive value (proportion of true negatives among all negative results) would decrease, while the positive predictive value (proportion of true positives among all positive results) would remain unchanged. Therefore, the correct answer is (A): increased specificity and decreased negative predictive value."

The specificity of a test is the proportion of true negatives (those without the condition who test negative) among all those without the condition. The negative predictive value is the proportion of people who test negative and do not have the condition among all those who test negative. Decreasing the cutoff for severe hyponatremia will increase the specificity of the test because it will reduce the number of false positives (those with serum levels between 115 and 120 mEq/L who do not need treatment with hypertonic saline). However, it will decrease the negative predictive value because it will increase the number of false negatives (those with serum levels below 115 mEq/L who actually need treatment but are not identified by the new cutoff). Therefore, the correct answer is (A)."

Changing the cutoff for severe hyponatremia to < 115 mEq/L would increase the number of patients who qualify for treatment with hypertonic saline, which would increase the specificity of the test (i.e. fewer false positives). However, it would also decrease the negative predictive value (i.e. more false negatives), as some patients with sodium levels between 115-120 mEq/L may still be at risk for developing symptoms of severe hyponatremia.

The question is asking how changing the cutoff for severe hyponatremia to < 115 mEq/L would affect the validity of serum sodium in predicting severe hyponatremia requiring hypertonic saline. Lowering the cutoff will make it more specific, meaning that a lower level of serum sodium will more accurately predict severe hyponatremia. However, it will decrease the negative predictive value, meaning that a higher level of serum sodium will no longer accurately rule out severe hyponatremia. Therefore, the answer is (A), increased specificity and decreased negative predictive value."
