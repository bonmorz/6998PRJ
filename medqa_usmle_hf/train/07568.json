A drug that increases lipoprotein lipase activity is most likely a fibrate drug, which can decrease serum triglyceride levels in patients with familial hypertriglyceridemia by enhancing the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. However, fibrate drugs can increase the risk of gallstone disease by increasing the amount of cholesterol secreted into bile, which can trigger the formation of gallstones. Therefore, the expected beneficial effect of this drug is due to its ability to enhance triglyceride clearance, not its effect on bile acid sequestration or PPAR-gamma activity."

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) helps break down triglycerides in VLDL, leading to their clearance from the bloodstream. Therefore, a drug that increases LPL activity would be expected to decrease serum triglycerides. The drug increases the risk of gallstone disease by increasing the amount of cholesterol in the bile, not by affecting bile acid sequestration."
