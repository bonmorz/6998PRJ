Hence, a positive stool guaiac test would confirm this suspicion. Elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration, Elevated serum lead concentration and Decreased CD4+ T-lymphocyte count are less likely causes of her symptoms."

Elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration suggests thyroid dysfunction, and an elevated lead concentration suggests lead poisoning, but neither of these conditions are likely to cause the patient\u2019s symptoms.
