The fact that the patient has not received any immunizations since childhood suggests that she may be at risk of contracting tetanus. It is important to administer a tetanus booster if the last booster was more than 5 years ago. Additionally, amoxicillin-clavulanate is recommended for a cat bite wound to prevent infection from Pasteurella multocida, the most common organism associated with cat bites. Closing the wound surgically or with tissue adhesive is not recommended for puncture wounds due to the risk of trapping bacteria within the wound. A wound culture may be obtained if the patient develops signs of infection despite prophylactic antibiotics."
