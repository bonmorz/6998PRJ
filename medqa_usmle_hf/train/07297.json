Bilateral optic disc swelling suggests elevated intracranial pressure, which could be caused by hepatic mitochondrial injury. The recent history of fever, myalgias, and sore throat suggest a possible viral infection that could have led to the hepatic injury. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms is hepatic mitochondrial injury."

The fact that the patient had a recent viral illness suggests that this could be a case of viral-induced liver injury leading to hepatic encephalopathy.
