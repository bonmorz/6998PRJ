The wobble phenomenon describes the flexibility of pairing between the third base of the codon and the first base of the anticodon in tRNA. This flexibility allows a single tRNA with the UUU anticodon to bind to both AAA and AAG codons, resulting in a reduced number of tRNAs required to translate all codons. Option (B) is incorrect as there are fewer amino acids than possible codons. Option (C) is incorrect as the last nucleotide does not provide specificity for the given amino acid. Option (D) is incorrect as mutations can occur in the genetic code over time."

The wobble phenomenon is a specific pairing at the third base of the codon and the first base of the anticodon.

The wobble phenomenon in translation refers to the ability of a tRNA with a non-complementary third nucleotide in its anticodon to still correctly recognize and bind with certain codons. Specifically, a tRNA with the UUU anticodon can bind to either the AAA or AAG codons due to the wobbling of the third nucleotide in the anticodon. This allows for greater flexibility and accuracy in translating genetic information. The other options are not related to the wobble phenomenon."

The wobble phenomenon refers to the ability of certain tRNA molecules to recognize more than one codon for a specific amino acid due to differences in the third base of the codon. For example, a tRNA with the UUU anticodon can bind to both AAA and AAG codons, due to the wobble pairing between the third base of the codon and the first base of the anticodon. Therefore, option (A) is correct. Option (B) is incorrect as there are actually more codons than possible amino acids. Option (C) is incorrect as the specificity of the amino acid is usually determined by the first two bases of the codon, not the last base. Option (D) is incorrect as the genetic code can undergo mutations and changes over time."
