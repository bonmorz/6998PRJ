The patient presents with symptoms of abdominal cramps, fatigue, and increased urination, along with a tender abdomen and a firm mass in the lower abdomen. These symptoms, along with the early systolic murmur and the family history of polycystic ovary syndrome, suggest a possible pregnancy, and thus the most appropriate next step in management would be to check serum \u03b2-hCG levels to rule out pregnancy. Pelvic ultrasound may also be needed to further evaluate the mass in the lower abdomen. Fasting glucose and lipid panel and serum fT4 testing may be useful in other scenarios, but are not indicated in this particular case."

Pelvic ultrasound may also be useful in confirming or ruling out pregnancy, and to assess the mass felt in the lower abdomen. The other options (fasting glucose and lipid panel, serum fT4) are not likely to be helpful in this scenario."
