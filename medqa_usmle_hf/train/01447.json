The patient is presenting with symptoms suggestive of Horner's syndrome, which includes partial ptosis, miosis (pupil constriction), and decreased sweating on the affected side of the face. Therefore, the most likely additional clinical feature would be loss of hemifacial sweating, as sweating is controlled by sympathetic nerves that also innervate the pupil and eyelid. Facial asymmetry may indicate a stroke or Bell's palsy, tongue deviation to the left side may indicate a cranial nerve lesion, and urinary retention may indicate a lesion in the sacral spinal cord. None of these are consistent with the symptoms presented by the patient."

Facial asymmetry could be a symptom of a stroke or Bell's palsy, but those conditions are not suggested by the patient's symptoms or history. Tongue deviation to the left side could suggest a lesion in the hypoglossal nerve, but there is no evidence to support that in this scenario.
