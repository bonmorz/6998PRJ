Abnormally shaped red blood cells are associated with sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies, altered kappa to lambda ratio is a possible finding in multiple myeloma, and antibodies to phospholipase A2 receptor are associated with membranous nephropathy, but none of these conditions are suggested by the patient's symptoms and test results."
