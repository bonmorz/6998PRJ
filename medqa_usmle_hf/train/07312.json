Antiphospholipid syndrome and NSAIDs nephropathy are less likely causes as they do not typically present with hemolysis or thrombocytopenia. While sickle cell disease can cause hemolysis, it is not commonly associated with acute kidney injury and hypertension."

The laboratory test shows decreased hemoglobin and platelets, as well as the presence of schistocytes, which are fragmented red blood cells commonly seen in HUS. The use of acetaminophen is unlikely to cause HUS. Sickle cell disease can also cause hemolysis, but it is unlikely to present with sudden onset of symptoms in a previously healthy patient. Antiphospholipid syndrome and NSAIDs nephropathy do not match the patient's symptoms."
