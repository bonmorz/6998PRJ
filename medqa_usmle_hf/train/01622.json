The patient\u2019s need for regular blood exchange and her uncle\u2019s need for the same treatment suggests that she likely has sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is caused by a point mutation resulting in an amino acid substitution in the beta chain of hemoglobin, which leads to sickling of red blood cells under certain conditions.

The patient's history, including regular blood exchanges, bone pain, and family history of the same condition, suggests sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell anemia is caused by an amino acid substitution (valine for glutamic acid) in the beta globin gene. This results in the formation of abnormal hemoglobin molecules (hemoglobin S) that can cause red blood cells to become misshapen and break down more easily, leading to complications such as anemia, pain, and organ damage."
