The symptoms, including fatigue, weight loss, double vision, and gritty sensation in the eyes, as well as painless swelling in fingers and lower legs suggest myasthenia gravis, which is caused by autoantibody stimulation of a receptor. Autoantibodies resulting in tissue destruction are more commonly seen in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Excessive exogenous hormone use is seen in conditions like Cushing's syndrome, and infiltration of tissue by neoplastic cells occurs in cancer."

The symptoms, especially the gritty sensation in the eyes, suggest that the most likely cause is Grave's disease, which is an autoimmune disorder that results in the production of antibodies that stimulate the thyroid gland. This stimulation can cause symptoms such as anxiety, fatigue, weight loss, double vision, and swelling in the fingers and lower legs. The autoantibodies in this condition stimulate a receptor, specifically the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor, leading to excessive production of thyroid hormone."
