The patient\u2019s symptoms point towards panic attacks and lorazepam is a medication used to treat anxiety and panic disorders. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine with sedative properties that can increase the sedative effects of lorazepam, so it should be avoided. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used to treat opioid overdose, and it is not typically contraindicated with lorazepam. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant that does not have direct interactions with lorazepam. Ondansetron is an antiemetic used to treat nausea and vomiting and is not typically contraindicated with lorazepam."
