Vertical tumor growth, or thickness, is the most important histologic predictor of metastasis in melanoma. Palisading nuclei and cellular atypia are also histologic features of melanoma, but they are not as strongly associated with a risk of metastasis. Increased production of melanosomes is a feature of melanoma cells, but it is not a histologic feature that predicts metastasis."
