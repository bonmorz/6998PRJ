The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a diagnosis of malignant otitis externa, which is usually caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Treatment options include broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, which can be given intravenously for severe cases. Topical antibiotics may be useful for mild cases. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment and surgical intervention may be considered in certain cases, but antibiotics are usually the first-line treatment."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including ear pain, otorrhea, facial droop, and granulation tissue in the ear, suggest a diagnosis of malignant otitis externa, which is commonly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Intravenous ciprofloxacin is an appropriate treatment for Pseudomonas infections, and a 6-week course is typically recommended for malignant otitis externa. Topical antibiotics are not as effective in treating this type of infection. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment may be considered in severe cases or as an adjunct to antibiotics, but it is not typically considered a first-line therapy. Surgical intervention may be considered in cases where there is severe necrosis or abscess formation, but it is not the initial recommended treatment."

The patient's symptoms and exam findings suggest malignant otitis externa, which is commonly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in diabetic patients. Treatment involves prolonged antibiotic therapy with coverage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Intravenous ciprofloxacin is a commonly used antibiotic for this purpose. Surgical intervention may be necessary if there is extensive tissue damage or bone involvement. Hyperbaric oxygen is an adjunctive therapy that may be used in severe cases, but it is not the first-line treatment. Topical antibiotics alone are unlikely to be effective for the type of infection that is likely present."
