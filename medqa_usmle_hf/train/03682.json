The best initial therapy would be to inhibit cholesterol synthesis, which is the mechanism of action of statins. This can help lower LDL-cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease for the patient. Option (A) is the mechanism of action of ezetimibe, which is used as an adjunct therapy with statins. Option (B) is the mechanism of action of bile acid sequestrants, which can also help lower LDL-cholesterol levels but are not the best initial therapy for this patient.

The best initial therapy for this patient is to inhibit cholesterol synthesis, which can be achieved with statins. This is because statins are the most potent and effective agents for reducing LDL-cholesterol levels. Option A, inhibition of cholesterol absorption, is achieved with ezetimibe, which may be used as an adjunct to statin therapy, but would not be the initial therapy for this patient. Option B, bile acid sequestration, is achieved with medications such as cholestyramine, but is less effective than statins and may have more adverse effects. Option D, activation of PPAR-alpha, is achieved with medications such as fibrates, which are effective in reducing triglycerides and increasing HDL-cholesterol, but would not be the initial therapy for this patient with high LDL-cholesterol."
