The laboratory test results suggest multiple myeloma, which is confirmed by the presence of an IgG kappa paraprotein and moderate osteopathy on CT scan. Acanthosis nigricans is a skin disorder associated with insulin resistance. Myeloblasts with azurophilic granules are seen in acute myeloid leukemia. Teardrop cells in blood smear are seen in myelodysplastic syndrome. None of these are associated with the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Osteoporosis is seen in multiple myeloma, as the cancer cells interfere with normal bone remodeling, leading to bone loss and increased risk of fractures."
