The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest bipolar disorder type I, as there is evidence of mania (irritability, mood swings, decreased need for sleep, flight of ideas, pressured speech) along with a history of major depressive disorder. Option B is incorrect as it refers to bipolar disorder type II, which is characterized by hypomania rather than full mania. Delusional disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder do not match the patient\u2019s symptoms."

Delusional disorder involves fixed false beliefs, which are not evident in this case, while bipolar disorder type II involves hypomanic (less severe than manic) episodes and major depressive episodes. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder can cause hyperactive behavior, but it does not include symptoms of grandiosity or reduced need for sleep."
