PCR for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhea are appropriate as well since the patient has a history of risky behavior and could also have other sexually transmitted infections. A lumbar puncture may be considered if there is a concern for neurosyphilis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. Blood cultures and CT angiography of the chest are not indicated based on the patient's presentation."

The symptoms and positive tests for rapid plasma reagin and fluorescent treponemal antibody suggest a diagnosis of syphilis. The papular rash, lymphadenopathy and patchy hair loss are consistent with secondary syphilis. The presence of flat, broad-based, wart-like papules suggests the possibility of genital warts, and PCR testing for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhea should be done to rule out co-infections. Lumbar puncture and CT angiography of the chest are not appropriate for this stage of syphilis. Blood cultures are not indicated unless there is evidence of sepsis or endocarditis."
