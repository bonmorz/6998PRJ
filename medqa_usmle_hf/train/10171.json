This is supported by the presence of proteinuria and fat globules in the urine, as well as the absence of other findings such as hyperlipidemia or loss of antithrombin III or globulin in the urine. Hypoalbuminemia can result from a variety of causes, including kidney disease, liver disease, malnutrition, and certain medications. Given the patient's history of diabetes mellitus, it is possible that he has developed kidney disease, which may be contributing to his hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria. Further evaluation, including additional laboratory tests and imaging studies, may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms."
