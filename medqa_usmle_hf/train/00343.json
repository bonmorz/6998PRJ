The decreased levels of potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus indicate a shift of electrolytes into cells, which can occur in response to insulin release after reintroduction of nutrition. Thiamine deficiency can also occur in patients with anorexia nervosa and contribute to cardiac complications, but it is less likely to explain the patient's current presentation. Rapid gastric emptying and euthyroid sick syndrome are not associated with the symptoms and laboratory findings in this case."

The patient's low BMI and anorexia nervosa suggest severe malnourishment, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and cardiac abnormalities. The low potassium and magnesium levels indicate electrolyte abnormalities, which can cause palpitations and paresthesias. The intermittent supraventricular tachycardia and QTc prolongation suggest the presence of a cardiac arrhythmia. Increased insulin release can cause hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia and can also cause cardiac arrhythmias. Thiamine deficiency can cause Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which can cause neurological symptoms but is unlikely to cause the cardiac abnormalities seen in this patient. Rapid gastric emptying can cause dumping syndrome, which can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting but is unlikely to cause the cardiac abnormalities seen in this patient. Euthyroid sick syndrome is a thyroid function abnormality that can occur with severe illness but is unlikely to cause the cardiac abnormalities seen in this patient. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is increased insulin release."

The low potassium and magnesium levels suggest that the patient has hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which can cause palpitations and paresthesias.

Thiamine deficiency can cause Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, but there is no evidence to suggest this in the patient. Rapid gastric emptying is not directly related to the patient's symptoms."

Of the options, increased insulin release is most likely to cause the electrolyte imbalances seen in this patient due to increased uptake and storage of electrolytes in cells.
