The patient's symptoms suggest myasthenic crisis, and the bluish discoloration of the lips and around the mouth with dilated nostrils suggest respiratory distress. Endotracheal intubation is the most appropriate next step to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and plasmapheresis are more appropriate for treating the underlying autoimmune disorder causing myasthenia gravis. Administration of edrophonium is a diagnostic test for myasthenia gravis but is not appropriate in this scenario because it can worsen the patient's respiratory distress."
