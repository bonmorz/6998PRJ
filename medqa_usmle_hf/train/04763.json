Transformation is the uptake and incorporation of foreign DNA by a bacterial cell.

The patient most likely has Clostridium difficile infection, which is caused by a toxin-producing strain of the bacteria.

Transformation and conjugation also involve transfer of genetic material, but they do not involve a bacteriophage. Transposition refers specifically to the movement of a transposable element (a piece of DNA that can move around within the genome) and is not directly relevant to the transmission of the toxin gene."
