In spinal cord injuries, numbness at the level of the lesion is a common finding in addition to the motor and sensory deficits. Intact voluntary anal contraction suggests that the injury is not at the level of S2-S5. Right-sided loss of proprioception and vibration sensation suggests that the injury is not confined to one side. Left-sided spastic paralysis below the lesion suggests that the injury is not complete and the patient may have some voluntary movement and muscle tone."

The symptoms described suggest that the patient has suffered a spinal cord injury, likely in the thoracic or lumbar region. Option A is the most likely finding as it corresponds to the level of the spinal cord lesion. Option B refers to the anal reflex, which may be preserved or absent after a spinal cord injury, but it is not the most likely finding. Option C relates to the dorsal columns in the spinal cord, which are not typically affected in acute spinal cord injuries. Option D describes spasticity, which may develop over time after a spinal cord injury but is not typically present at the time of injury."

A common symptom of spinal cord injury is numbness at the level of the lesion, which in this case would be on the left side. Other possible symptoms include loss of bowel and bladder control and spastic paralysis below the lesion. However, intact voluntary anal contraction suggests that the injury is not severe enough to affect this functionality. Right-sided loss of proprioception and vibration sensation is not likely, as the symptoms are mostly on the left side."

Right-sided loss of proprioception and vibration sensation suggests an injury at the dorsal column, which is not typical for this patient. Left-sided spastic paralysis below the lesion is more commonly seen in chronic spinal cord injuries."
