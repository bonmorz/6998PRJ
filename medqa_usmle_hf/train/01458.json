The symptoms suggest a femoral nerve injury, as the patient has decreased strength on hip flexion and knee extension and decreased sensation on the anteromedial thigh, which are all features of femoral nerve innervation. Sural nerve injury would result in loss of sensation on the lateral foot and fibular nerve injury would result in weakness and sensory loss on the dorsiflexed foot. S1 radiculopathy would affect the posterior thigh and the lateral foot, but not the anteromedial thigh. The fact that the symptoms occurred after hip arthroplasty suggest that the femoral nerve may have been compressed or injured during the surgery."

The femoral nerve supplies the muscles that flex the hip and extend the knee, which is consistent with the patient's left leg strength of 3/5 on hip flexion and 2/5 on knee extension. The patellar reflex is decreased on the left, which is also consistent with femoral nerve injury. The decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch on the anteromedial left thigh and medial lower leg suggest involvement of the femoral nerve distribution. Sural nerve injury and fibular nerve injury do not affect the femoral nerve distribution, while S1 radiculopathy involves a different nerve root."
