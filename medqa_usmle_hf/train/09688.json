Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies can help diagnose celiac disease, which is a common cause of malabsorption and may lead to osteoporosis. D-xylose test is used to evaluate absorptive capacity of the small intestine, but is not the best option in this case. ASCAs are associated with inflammatory bowel disease, which may cause diarrhea and weight loss, but not necessarily malabsorption. Hydrogen breath test is used to diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, which may cause diarrhea and flatulence, but not the other symptoms mentioned in the case."
