The symptoms described suggest facial nerve palsy, which can be caused by a number of factors, including viral infections (such as herpes simplex virus), trauma, and tumors. However, given the history of head injury and the timing of onset of symptoms, the most likely cause in this case is likely to be Bell's palsy. Steroid therapy is the treatment of choice for Bell's palsy, and should be initiated as soon as possible to improve outcomes. The other options are not appropriate for this condition: Acyclovir would only be useful if the cause was a herpes simplex infection, which is less likely given the history of head injury; surgical decompression is generally not recommended except in cases where there is evidence of compression of the facial nerve by a tumor or other lesion. Reassurance alone would not be sufficient given the potential for permanent damage to the facial nerve if left untreated."
