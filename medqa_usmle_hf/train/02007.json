The patient\u2019s history of skipping medications and the CD4 count of 75 cells/\u00b5L suggest HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). However, the imaging shows numerous lesions and brain biopsy reveals atypical astrocytes, which are seen in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by the JC virus. Option A, autoimmune demyelination, would show different imaging findings and biopsy results. Option D, PCNSL, would show enhancing lesions on imaging."

The patient\u2019s history of skipping antiretroviral medications puts her at high risk for opportunistic infections, including JC virus infection, which can cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a demyelinating disease. The MRI findings and brain biopsy both support this diagnosis. Autoimmune demyelination would not be expected in a patient with HIV, and PCNSL typically presents as a mass lesion. HAND may be a concern, but the MRI findings and brain biopsy suggest a more specific diagnosis."
