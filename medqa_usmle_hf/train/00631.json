The symptoms and presentation suggest that the most likely diagnosis is Roseola infantum (also known as exanthem subitum). It is characterized by a high fever followed by a rash that spreads to the trunk and extremities. The rash is maculopapular and blanches on pressure, and posterior auricular lymphadenopathy is present. Kawasaki disease presents with fever and a different type of rash. Impetigo presents with a localized rash with crusting and discharge. Rubella presents with a rash starting on the face and spreading to the trunk and extremities."

The symptoms suggest that the most likely cause is Roseola infantum, which is a viral illness that causes a high fever followed by a rash. The rash is maculopapular and blanches on pressure. Posterior auricular lymphadenopathy is also a common feature of Roseola infantum. Kawasaki disease is characterized by fever, conjunctivitis, rash, lymphadenopathy, and involvement of the coronary arteries, but the rash does not blanch on pressure. Impetigo is a bacterial skin infection that presents with vesicles and honey-colored crusts, not a maculopapular rash. Rubella presents with a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the trunk and extremities, but there is no history of vaccination and the timing doesn't fit as the rash started on the trunk."
