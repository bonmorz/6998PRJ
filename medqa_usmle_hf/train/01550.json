The hormone released by ventricular cardiomyocytes in response to increased wall stress is likely to be atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). ANP acts via the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which has a similar intracellular mechanism to nitric oxide, making it the most similar option among the given substances. Human chorionic gonadotropin and platelet-derived growth factor have different mechanisms of action, while aldosterone primarily acts through the mineralocorticoid receptor."

The hormone released by ventricular cardiomyocytes in response to increased wall stress is likely to be B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), which has a mechanism of action similar to nitric oxide in vasodilation and inhibition of aldosterone secretion. Nitric oxide also acts on smooth muscle cells to promote vasodilation. Human chorionic gonadotropin is a hormone secreted by the placenta during pregnancy, not related to heart failure. Aldosterone promotes sodium retention and potassium excretion and has a different mechanism of action. Platelet-derived growth factor is involved in cell growth and division, not related to heart failure."
