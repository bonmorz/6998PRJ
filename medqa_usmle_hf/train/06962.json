The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest peripheral arterial disease, with an ankle-brachial index below 0.9 indicating moderate disease.

Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent that can improve peripheral blood flow and decrease the risk of cardiovascular events, and is an appropriate choice for this patient. Angioplasty or surgery may be considered if symptoms are refractory to medical management. Bed rest and electromyography are not appropriate for the management of peripheral arterial disease."
