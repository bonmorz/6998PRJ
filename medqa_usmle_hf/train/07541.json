The patient\u2019s history and symptoms suggest gout, which is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joint. These crystals are negatively birefringent, which means they appear yellow when parallel to the polarizing filter and blue when perpendicular. Fractures, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation are not typically seen with gout. Positively birefringent crystals are seen in calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD), which can cause joint pain but is less likely than gout in this case."
