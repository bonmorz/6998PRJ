The patient\u2019s symptoms and physical exam findings suggest musculoskeletal inflammation, which can be caused by strain or overuse from playing soccer or carrying luggage during her trans-Atlantic flight. There are no significant findings suggestive of a clot in the pulmonary arteries or ischemia of the myocardium. The lack of neurologic deficits suggests a non-neurologic etiology and the absence of psychiatric symptoms makes a psychogenic etiology less likely."

Ischemia of the myocardium (heart attack) would likely have additional symptoms such as radiation of pain to the left arm or neck, and possibly diaphoresis or nausea. Psychogenic etiology would require a more thorough psychological evaluation to confirm."

Clots in the pulmonary arteries can cause pulmonary embolism, which presents with similar symptoms but would show abnormal findings in cardiac and pulmonary exams. Ischemia of the myocardium would present with different symptoms, such as chest pressure or tightness, and would likely show abnormal findings in cardiac exams.
