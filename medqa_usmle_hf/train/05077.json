It is contraindicated in patients with anorexia or bulimia as it may exacerbate these conditions. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are also a contraindication for bupropion, but this information is not given in the question. Option (B) is not relevant as age alone is not a contraindication for this drug. Option (D) is also a valid contraindication as bupropion has not been studied enough in pregnant women to determine its safety."

Option (B) is not a contraindication, but caution should be taken in elderly patients due to an increased risk of seizures.
