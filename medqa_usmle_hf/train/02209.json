Although the limited abdominal ultrasound did not support cholecystitis, the incidental finding of adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder might explain the patient's symptoms. Since the patient has no clinical features suspicious for malignancy, no further treatment is required. Option (B) and (C) would only be considered if there is suspicion of obstructive jaundice. Option (A) is not indicated in this case as the symptoms are suggesting a gallbladder issue, not esophageal."
