It is based on five criteria: Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration. Each criterion is scored on a scale of 0 to 2, with a total score of 10 indicating the best possible condition. In this case, the baby's cry and pink appearance suggest a score of 2 for appearance, and the pulse rate suggests a score of 2 for pulse. The fact that the baby's extremities are flexed suggests a score of 1 for activity, and inducing discomfort may indicate a slight grimace, suggesting a score of 1 for grimace. The score for respiration cannot be determined from the given information. Therefore, the most likely APGAR score for this newborn at this time is 7 (2+2+1+1+0)."

The score is based on 5 factors: Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration. The maximum score is 10, and a score of 7-10 is normal. In this case, the baby appears pink, has a pulse of 128 beats per minute, and is crying vigorously, which suggests good appearance, pulse, and activity. However, the fact that the extremities are blue and flexed indicates some respiratory distress or lack of oxygenation, resulting in a score of 7."

In this case, the newborn is crying vigorously, indicating a heart rate of at least 100, reflex irritability is present, and color is pink with blue extremities.
