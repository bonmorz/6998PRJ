The patient\u2019s belief about the celebrity actor loving her and wanting to marry her is a fixed, false belief that is not consistent with cultural norms, and there are no other signs of a more severe disorder like schizophrenia. This is consistent with a diagnosis of Delusional disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder would show odd or eccentric behavior and speech, and Schizoid personality disorder would show a lack of interest or desire for close relationships. Schizophreniform disorder would have more severe symptoms like hallucinations and disorganized speech."
