Subcutaneous insulin may be needed if the patient's glucose levels remain elevated, but the question only asks for what should be administered during labor, not necessarily postpartum. Therefore, 5% dextrose (option A) should be administered during labor to prevent hypoglycemia in the fetus, especially if the patient is receiving insulin to control her gestational diabetes."
