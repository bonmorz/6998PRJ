Impairment of the median nerve will affect the movement of the anterior forearm muscles that it innervates, leading to weakness in extension of the wrist and fingers. Option (B) is incorrect because opposition of the thumb is controlled by the radial nerve. Option (C) is incorrect because flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints is controlled by the ulnar nerve. Option (D) is incorrect because abduction of the shoulder above 100 degrees is controlled by the suprascapular nerve."
