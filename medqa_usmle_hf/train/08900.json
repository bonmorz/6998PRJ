Each category is scored from 0-2 and the scores are totaled for a maximum score of 10. Based on the given information, the baby's initial appearance (pale throughout) would be scored a 0, pulse (120/min) would be scored a 1, grimace (flexion of extremities when stimulated) would be scored a 1, activity (arms and legs flexed without active motion) would be scored a 1, and respiration (irregular) would be scored a 2.
