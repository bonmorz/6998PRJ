The picture shows positive birefringent rods consistent with calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD), also known as pseudogout, which can cause episodes of sudden pain and swelling in joints. Mechanical stress and trauma can also result in joint pain, but CPPD is the most likely underlying mechanism in this patient. Immune complex-mediated cartilage destruction is seen in rheumatoid arthritis, while monosodium urate deposition is seen in gout."

Immune complex-mediated cartilage destruction and monosodium urate deposition are characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis and gout, respectively, and are not likely to be the cause of this patient's knee pain."
