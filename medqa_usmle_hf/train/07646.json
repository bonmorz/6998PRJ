Infundibular pulmonary stenosis, overriding aorta, and ventricular septal defect can cause right to left shunting of blood, resulting in cyanosis. However, the absence of cyanosis suggests that the degree of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction is not severe enough to cause significant shunting at this time. The size of the ventricular septal defect and concentration of pulmonary surfactant are not directly related to the presence or absence of cyanosis in this case."
