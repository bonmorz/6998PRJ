The patient\u2019s back pain is worse in the morning and improves with exercise, which suggests Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). The tenderness over the sacroiliac joints and erosion and sclerosis of the sacroiliac joints on spine x-ray is consistent with AS. Examination of the Achilles tendon is commonly used in the diagnosis of AS, as patients with AS may show tenderness at the site of insertion of the Achilles tendon, so the correct answer is (C). Nail pitting and separation of the nail from the nailbed is a common finding in psoriasis, not AS. Paresthesia over the anterolateral part of the thigh is indicative of meralgia paresthetica, a condition that occurs due to compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve in the thigh. Ulnar deviation of the fingers bilaterally is seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis."
