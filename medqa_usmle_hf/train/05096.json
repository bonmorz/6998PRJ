The lack of elevation with inner thigh stroking is called the Prehn sign, which makes epididymitis less likely. The next step in the management is surgical exploration to detorse the affected testis and evaluate for viability. CT scan or IV antibiotics are not appropriate for this suspected diagnosis. Observation with pain management may lead to testicular loss."

The patient presents with severe lower abdominal pain that radiates to his left thigh, along with vomiting and an elevated left testicle that is diffusely tender. These are suggestive of testicular torsion, a surgical emergency. The lack of tenderness in all 4 quadrants suggests it is not a gastrointestinal issue, so a CT scan is not necessary. IV antibiotics may be necessary if there is an infection, but it is not the first-line treatment for testicular torsion. Observation and morphine will not address the underlying issue and can lead to delay in treatment. Therefore, surgical exploration is the next step in the management of this patient."

The symptoms, including severe lower abdominal pain that wakes the patient from sleep and radiates to the left thigh, and an elevated, diffusely tender left testicle suggest testicular torsion. Surgical exploration is necessary as it is a urologic emergency that requires immediate intervention to restore blood flow to the affected testis. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis and IV antibiotics are not indicated for testicular torsion. Observation and morphine may alleviate pain but do not address the underlying issue."
