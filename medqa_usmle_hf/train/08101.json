Gram-positive cocci in clusters are commonly associated with Staphylococcus aureus, which is often seen in healthcare-associated (nosocomial) infections. Therefore, the most commonly associated clinical scenario is a hospitalized adult with development of pneumonia symptoms 2 weeks following a viral illness. HIV positive patients with a low CD4 count are more susceptible to fungal and atypical bacterial infections. An otherwise healthy young adult with mild symptoms is more likely to have a viral respiratory infection. Empyema and \"currant jelly sputum\" are associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is a common cause of pneumonia in alcoholics."
