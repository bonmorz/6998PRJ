Spirometry indicates an obstructive pattern, meaning that air is trapped in the lungs. The most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy would be a combination inhaler with both a corticosteroid (such as budesonide) and a long-acting bronchodilator (such as formoterol). This combination can help reduce inflammation in the airways and relax the muscles surrounding them. Fluticasone alone (option B) may not be enough to address the underlying inflammation. Oral montelukast (option C) is a leukotriene receptor antagonist and may not be as effective as the combination inhaler. Option D suggests using two different medications, but a combination inhaler would be a simpler and more effective option initially."
