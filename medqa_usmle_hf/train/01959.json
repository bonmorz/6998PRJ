In this case, the karyotype will be 46,XX of paternal origin only, meaning that all chromosomes were contributed by the father and there is no maternal contribution."

Complete moles result from fertilization of an egg without genetic material or fertilization by two sperm. In this case, there is likely fertilization of an egg by two sperm resulting in 46,XX of paternal origin only. Option A is incorrect because there is no maternal genetic material present in the mole. Option B is incorrect because 69,XXY is a triploid karyotype, and complete moles are diploid. Option D is incorrect because 69,XYY is also a triploid karyotype."

The karyotype of a complete mole is typically 46,XX, but it is of paternal origin only as the egg\u2019s chromosomes have been lost or inactivated. Therefore, option (C) is the most likely karyotype."

The ultrasound findings suggest a molar pregnancy, which is caused by the fertilization of an empty egg by a haploid sperm or by the fertilization of an egg by two sperm. This leads to a paternal genetic contribution only, resulting in the karyotype of 46,XX of paternal origin. Option A is impossible because it would require a maternal genetic contribution. Option B is unlikely and not correlated because it would result in a completely different karyotype. Option D is also not correlated because it would involve a different set of chromosomes."
