Nitrites are not typically present in the urine in cases of urinary stones, and proteinuria is not associated with kidney stones. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) urinary pH: 4.7."

Positive nitrites test and largely positive urinary protein are indicative of urinary tract infection and nephrotic syndrome, respectively, which are not likely causes of the patient's symptoms."
