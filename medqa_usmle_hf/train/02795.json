The symptoms, including waddling gait, calf enlargement, and absent reflexes, are suggestive of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The best next step to confirm the diagnosis is genetic testing, which can identify mutations in the DMD gene that cause this disease. Electromyogram, muscle biopsy, and serum creatine kinase level can also support the diagnosis, but genetic testing is more specific and definitive."
