The patient's presentation suggests that she may have a liver hematoma due to the right-sided chest pain, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and right shoulder pain.

The patient fell down the stairs and has tenderness over the right upper quadrant and right chest wall along with shortness of breath and hypotension. These findings are suggestive of a liver hematoma, which can cause intra-abdominal bleeding and hypovolemic shock. Splenic laceration and pneumothorax can also cause similar symptoms but are less likely given the location of the tenderness.
