The patient presents with amenorrhea and fine hair over the trunk, which suggests anorexia nervosa, a type of nutritional deficiency. The serum studies show low levels of estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone, which support this diagnosis. Exogenous steroid use would elevate levels of both estradiol and androgens. Defective androgen receptors would cause masculinization and would not explain the amenorrhea. Gonadal dysgenesis would result in primary amenorrhea, not secondary amenorrhea as seen in this patient."

Exogenous steroid use and defective androgen receptors are unlikely to cause these findings."
