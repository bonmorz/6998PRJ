Option (B), pancreatic islet hyperplasia and hypertrophy, is a benign condition that can cause hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia, but not the symptoms described. Option (C), the patient's weight, is not a likely cause of the symptoms, especially considering his normal BMI. Option (D), insensitivity to insulin, is a possible cause of diabetes mellitus, but not the most likely cause in this patient given the classic triad of symptoms."
