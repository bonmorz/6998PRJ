Option (D) is a finding in a hydrosalpinx, but TOA is more likely to show decreased blood flow on doppler due to the inflammatory process."

Since the urine pregnancy test is negative, ectopic pregnancy is less likely. The severe tenderness on the right lower quadrant and adnexal tenderness suggest inflammation of the right ovary, fallopian tube, or both. Decreased ovarian blood flow on doppler is indicative of ovarian torsion, which is a potential complication of PID. A and D are incorrect because they describe findings of a tubal pregnancy, while C describes a uterine mass which is not supported by the patient\u2019s history and examination."
