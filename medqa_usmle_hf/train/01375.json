The bacteria produce tetanospasmin which binds to nerve endings, leading to muscle spasms. The most effective prevention method is through administering a toxoid vaccine to the mother during pregnancy, which provides passive immunity to the infant through placental transfer of immunoglobulin G. The conjugated polysaccharide vaccine is used for Haemophilus influenzae type b, not for tetanus. Improving maternal nutrition and genetic counseling may be important for overall health but would not prevent neonatal tetanus."

The figure shows a child with tetanus, which can be prevented by administering toxoid vaccine to the mother before giving birth to the child.
