The sudden and severe pain, vomiting, absence of the cremasteric reflex, and a transverse lie of the left testis suggest testicular torsion. Epididymitis would be associated with dysuria and frequency, mumps orchitis would have a prodromal viral illness, and germ cell tumor would be asymptomatic or present with a painless mass. Ultrasonographic examination may confirm the diagnosis of testicular torsion. Emergency surgery is needed to detorse the testis and if necessary, surgical fixation of the testis to prevent future occurrences."

Germ cell tumor would not present with sudden onset of pain. Ultrasonographic examination would confirm the diagnosis and assess for testicular blood flow."
