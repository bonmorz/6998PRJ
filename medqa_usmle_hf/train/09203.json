The patient exhibits symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction, including skin rash, swelling, itching, and respiratory distress. These are classic symptoms of a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, which is an IgE-mediated response to an allergen. The family history of peanut allergy further supports this diagnosis, as peanuts are a common allergen associated with type 1 hypersensitivity reactions. Type 3 and type 4 hypersensitivity reactions do not typically involve respiratory distress or anaphylaxis. Mixed type 1 and type 3 hypersensitivity reactions are possible but less likely given the severity of the symptoms and the rapid onset after exposure to the allergen."

The rapid onset and distribution of symptoms, including skin rash, swelling, itching, and inspiratory stridor, are characteristic of this type of reaction. Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by IgE antibodies, which bind to allergens and trigger mast cells in tissues to release histamine and other inflammatory mediators.\n\nType 3 hypersensitivity reactions involve the formation of immune complexes that deposit in tissues and lead to inflammation and tissue damage. Type 4 hypersensitivity reactions are delayed hypersensitivity reactions that occur when T cells react to a specific antigen. Mixed type 1 and type 3 hypersensitivity reactions are possible but would require a more complex immune response."
