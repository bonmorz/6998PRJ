Administering antibiotics is necessary to treat the positive result of nucleic acid amplification testing, and obtaining parental consent may delay the treatment process. Performing urethral swab culture for antibiotic sensitivities and discussing results with patient's primary care physician may also be important but not as urgent as administering antibiotics. The patient's request for confidentiality should be respected, while also ensuring that appropriate treatment is provided."
