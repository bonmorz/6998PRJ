The patient has a resting tremor that is worse on one side, along with reduced facial expressions and resistance to manipulation of the upper extremities, which are all indicative of parkinson disease. The patient's age also fits the usual onset age of onset for this disease. Essential tremor is typically bilateral and occurs during movement, not at rest. Progressive supranuclear palsy may have some similar symptoms, but usually involves eye movement abnormalities as well. Tardive dyskinesia is usually a drug-induced movement disorder, and the patient's medications do not usually cause this condition."
