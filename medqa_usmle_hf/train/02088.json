In this case, the mother has type O+ blood, which means she does not have any antigens on her blood cells, while the father has type A+ blood, which means he has A antigens on his blood cells. This can lead to fetomaternal incompatibility, but it is a rare cause of newborn hemolytic disease. Prenatal detection is important, but there is no mention of severe fetal anemia or a strongly positive direct Coombs test. It is also important to note that hemolytic disease of the newborn is more common in subsequent pregnancies if the mother has already been sensitized to the Rh factor."

In this case, the mother has type O+ blood, which means she doesn't have any A or B antigens on her red blood cells, but does have the Rh factor. The father has type A+ blood, which means he has A antigens on his red blood cells and the Rh factor. If the fetus inherits the A antigen from the father, there won't be any issues related to blood type incompatibility. Only if the fetus inherits the B antigen from the father, and is Rh positive, it will be at risk of hemolytic disease of the newborn, which is rare. A direct Coombs test may be positive in hemolytic disease, but it is not strongly positive in fetomaternal incompatibility. Detecting the incompatibility early in pregnancy is still important even if the risk is low, and proper follow-up and treatment can prevent severe fetal anemia. It is also not true that fetomaternal incompatibility cannot affect first borns, as the risk increases with subsequent pregnancies."

If the baby has A blood type, there is a risk of hemolytic disease of the newborn due to ABO incompatibility. However, ABO incompatibility is a less severe form of hemolytic disease compared to Rh incompatibility, which occurs when the mother is Rh-negative and the baby is Rh-positive. Prenatal detection is still important to monitor for any signs of anemia, but ABO incompatibility is not associated with severe fetal anemia. A direct Coombs test is not necessary for ABO incompatibility."

Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) occurs when there is an incompatibility between the blood types of the mother and fetus, leading to maternal antibodies attacking fetal red blood cells. In this case, the mother has type O+ blood and the father has type A+ blood. This can lead to ABO incompatibility, which is rare and usually mild. First-born children are usually not affected as the mother usually does not produce antibodies until after the first pregnancy. Prenatal detection is important but not as crucial as in Rh incompatibility, and a direct Coombs test is usually negative in ABO incompatibility. Therefore, option (D) is correct."
