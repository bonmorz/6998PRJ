The patient is experiencing decreased libido as a side effect of paroxetine, which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Therefore, a different medication with a different mechanism of action is being considered. Buspirone is a partial agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor and is commonly used to treat anxiety disorders. Amitriptyline and Duloxetine are both antidepressants with different mechanisms of action and are not commonly used to treat anxiety disorders. Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that may be used to treat anxiety disorders that are refractory to other treatments, but it is not a partial agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor."
