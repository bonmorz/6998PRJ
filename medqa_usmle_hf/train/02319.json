The patient has symptoms consistent with pericarditis, which is characterized by chest pain that worsens with inspiration and is relieved by leaning forward. Dressler syndrome is a post-MI complication and would not explain the diffuse ST elevations on ECG. Acute myocardial infarction would present with similar symptoms, but ECG changes would be localized rather than diffuse. Systemic lupus erythematosus is not typically associated with pericarditis, and the cardiac findings on physical exam and ECG are not consistent with this condition. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms is an acute viral infection."

Among the given options, Dressler syndrome is a subtype of pericarditis that occurs post-myocardial infarction, so it is less likely in this case. Acute myocardial infarction would show elevated ST segments, not depressed PR intervals. Systemic lupus erythematosus can cause pericarditis, but other symptoms and medical history would likely be present. Acute viral infection can cause pericarditis, and the symptoms and examination findings support this as the most likely cause."

The symptoms of sharp chest pain, relieved with leaning forward, and myalgias suggest acute viral infection, especially if the patient also has a fever. Dressler syndrome usually occurs weeks to months after a myocardial infarction and is associated with pericardial friction rub and ECG changes. Systemic lupus erythematosus can cause pericarditis but not usually accompanied by ECG changes like ST elevations. While acute myocardial infarction could cause chest pain and ECG changes, the high-pitched rubbing sound suggests pericarditis rather than myocardial infarction."

The symptoms, especially the sharp chest pain that worsens with inspiration and is relieved by leaning forward, are classic symptoms of pericarditis.

Acute myocardial infarction and systemic lupus erythematosus are less likely causes of pericarditis. Acute viral infection is a common cause of pericarditis, such as a viral respiratory infection, which is consistent with the patient\u2019s myalgias and father\u2019s coronary artery disease does not suggest a familial cardiomyopathy."
