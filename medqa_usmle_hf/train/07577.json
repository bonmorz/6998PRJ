For a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the values fall within one standard deviation of the mean and approximately 95% of the values fall within two standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, option (B) is the correct statement as it falls within 99.7% of the range of heights for women. Option (A) cannot be determined as the distribution of weight is not normal. Option (C) and (D) are close, but option (C) is more accurate as it falls within 99.7% of the range of heights for men."

Using this formula, we can determine that option (B) is correct. For women, the mean height is 64 inches with a standard deviation of 0.1, so two standard deviations below and above the mean would be 64 - (2 x 0.1) = 63.8 inches and 64 + (2 x 0.1) = 64.2 inches, respectively. Thus, 99.7% of heights in women are likely to fall between 63.7 and 64.3 inches. Option (C) is close, but not exact, as the correct range for men's heights would be between 68.8 and 69.2 inches. Option (A) and option (D) are incorrect as they do not accurately reflect the distribution of weights or heights."

For a normal distribution, we know that approximately 68% of values fall within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% of values fall within two standard deviations of the mean, and 99.7% of values fall within three standard deviations of the mean. \n\nFor the heights of women, the mean is 64 inches and the standard deviation is 0.1. Therefore, we can say with 99.7% confidence that heights in women are likely to fall between 64 - (3 x 0.1) = 63.7 inches and 64 + (3 x 0.1) = 64.3 inches. So option (B) is the correct answer. \n\nFor the weights of women, the mean is 154 pounds, but we do not know the standard deviation or the shape of the distribution, so we cannot estimate the percentage of weights that fall between any specific range. Option (A) is incorrect for this reason. \n\nFor the heights of men, the mean is 69 inches and the standard deviation is 0.1. Therefore, we can say with 99.7% confidence that heights in men are likely to fall between 69 - (3 x 0.1) = 68.8 inches and 69 + (3 x 0.1) = 69.2 inches. So option (C) is partially correct (but we cannot accurately estimate a 95% confidence interval from this information). \n\nOption (D) is incorrect because it creates a range based on a specific mean and standard deviation that are not provided in the question."

Using the mean and SD values given, we can calculate the range of heights that are likely to fall within two SDs of the mean for each sex:\n- Men: mean +/- (2 x SD) = 69 +/- (2 x 0.1) = 68.8 - 69.2 inches\n- Women: mean +/- (2 x SD) = 64 +/- (2 x 0.1) = 63.8 - 64.2 inches\nTherefore, answer choice (B) is correct, stating that 99.7% of heights in women are likely to fall between 63.7 and 64.3 inches, which is within two SDs of the mean for women. Answer choice (C) is also correct, stating that 99.7% of heights in men are likely to fall between 68.8 and 69.2 inches, which is within two SDs of the mean for men. Answer choice (D) is incorrect because it narrows the range to 95%, which is within one SD of the mean for men, but the question specifically asks for the range within two SDs. Answer choice (A) is incorrect because it assumes a normal distribution for weight, which is not the case, and it also narrows the range to 68%, which is within one SD of the mean for women."

For option A, we use the mean weight of 154 pounds and a standard deviation of 1.0 pound to calculate the 68% confidence interval, which would be \u00b11 standard deviation from the mean. This results in a range of 153 to 155 pounds, making option A correct.

This results in a range of 68.85 to 69.15 inches, making option D correct as well.
