Identification is a defense mechanism in which an individual adopts the characteristics or behavior of another person or group, often as a means of coping with feelings of inadequacy or anxiety. In this case, the man may be identifying with his abusive father as a way of coping with his own childhood trauma. Projection involves attributing one's own unacceptable thoughts or feelings onto someone else, while distortion involves misinterpreting or altering reality to fit one's own beliefs or desires. Splitting involves perceiving people or situations in black or white terms, rather than recognizing shades of gray. None of the other defense mechanisms are particularly applicable to this scenario."

Identification is the process by which an individual unconsciously takes on characteristics, behaviors, or qualities of another person, and this man may be unconsciously identifying with his abusive father.
