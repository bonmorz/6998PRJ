This leads to the loss of expression of certain genes, resulting in symptoms such as poor muscle tone, feeding difficulties, and delayed development. Heteroplasmy is a mitochondrial phenomenon where cells contain a mixture of normal and mutated mitochondria. Anticipation refers to genetic disorders where the symptoms worsen with each generation. Incomplete penetrance refers to genetic disorders where some individuals with the gene mutation do not exhibit any symptoms."

Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by genetic changes on chromosome 15, specifically a lack of expression of genes on the paternal copy of chromosome 15. This is due to a phenomenon called imprinting, where certain genes are only expressed from one parent. In most cases of Prader-Willi syndrome, the paternal copy of chromosome 15 is deleted or otherwise silenced in the imprinting region. Therefore, the correct answer is (B), silencing in imprinting region."

This silencing of imprinted genes is the most common mechanism for the development of this condition. Heteroplasmy refers to the presence of two or more genetically distinct mitochondrial DNA types in the same individual. Anticipation describes a genetic phenomenon in which the severity or age of onset of a disease increases in successive generations. Incomplete penetrance refers to the situation in which not all individuals carrying a disease-associated genotype express the disease phenotype. None of these mechanisms are applicable to the development of Prader-Willi syndrome."
