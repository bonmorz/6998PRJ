The symptoms and laboratory test result suggest that the patient has type 1 diabetes, which can cause frequent falling and difficulty walking. Expansion of GAA trinucleotide repeats is associated with Friedrich's ataxia, which can also cause difficulty walking but typically presents earlier in childhood with other symptoms such as scoliosis and muscle weakness. Absence of dystrophin protein is seen in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which typically presents with delayed motor milestones and muscle weakness. Duplication of PMP22 gene is seen in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which causes peripheral neuropathy and foot deformities but typically presents later in the teenage or early adult years with gradually worsening symptoms. Defect of ATM protein is associated with ataxia-telangiectasia, which presents early in childhood with neurologic abnormalities, immune deficiency, and increased risk of cancer."
