The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of vasculitis, and the previous episodes suggest it may be a systemic condition. The presence of nodules and a cord-like structure suggest the possibility of thrombosis, possibly in the abdomen. CT scan of the abdomen would be the most appropriate next step in diagnosis to evaluate for potential underlying conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease or malignancy. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level is often used in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, which is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. Coagulation studies and ankle brachial index are not as relevant in the evaluation of this patient's symptoms."
