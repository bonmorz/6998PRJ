The medication most likely prescribed is pilocarpine, which is a cholinergic agonist that contracts the ciliary muscle and opens the canal of Schlemm, increasing the outflow of aqueous humor and decreasing IOP. Answer (C) is correct. Answer (A) is incorrect, as it describes the mechanism of action of a different class of glaucoma medication, such as timolol. Answer (B) is also incorrect, as it describes the mechanism of action of a different class of glaucoma medication, such as latanoprost. Answer (D) is incorrect, as there is no glaucoma medication that increases the permeability of sclera to aqueous humor."

Inhibiting the production of aqueous humor and closing the trabecular mesh by relaxing the ciliary muscles are mechanisms of action for other glaucoma medications. Increasing the permeability of sclera to aqueous humor is not a proven mechanism of action for any glaucoma medication."
