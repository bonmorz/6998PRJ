The patient's symptoms suggest systemic candidiasis, which is more likely to occur in patients with underlying immunodeficiency. Among the options, Myeloperoxidase deficiency is associated with an increased susceptibility to candidiasis. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 and Chediak-Hegashi syndrome are associated with recurrent bacterial infections, and X-linked agammaglobulinemia is associated with recurrent viral and bacterial infections. The normal nitroblue tetrazolium test also supports the diagnosis of Myeloperoxidase deficiency because this test measures the ability of neutrophils to produce reactive oxygen species, which is defective in this disorder."

Myeloperoxidase deficiency and Chediak-Hegashi syndrome affect neutrophil function and can cause severe infections but do not necessarily lead to candidiasis. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 affects leukocyte function and can cause recurrent infections and impaired wound healing but does not necessarily lead to candidiasis.
