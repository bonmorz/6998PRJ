The sudden onset of dyspnea and chest pain with decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance on the affected side suggest a pneumothorax.

Compression of a main bronchus due to neoplasia or formation of an intimal flap in the aorta are unlikely causes of this presentation.

The decreased tactile fremitus and breath sounds on the right with hyperresonance on percussion suggest a tension pneumothorax caused by the rupture of an apical alveolar bleb. This is further supported by the patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which increases the risk of developing a pneumothorax. Compression of a main bronchus due to neoplasia would cause slow onset symptoms and hyperresonance only if the affected lung has collapsed completely. Formation of an intimal flap in the aorta would cause symptoms related to aortic dissection, such as severe chest or back pain with a tearing or ripping sensation. Increased myocardial oxygen demand would cause symptoms related to myocardial infarction, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and sweating."
