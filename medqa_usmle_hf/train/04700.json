The presence of vesicular skin lesions on the abdomen but not on the face, palms or soles indicate that this is likely a case of PUPPP (pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy), which is a benign condition that is usually self-limited. Treatment with topical steroids can provide symptomatic relief. Biopsy is not necessary since the diagnosis can be made clinically. Antepartum testing is not indicated since there is no evidence of fetal distress. Systemic oral corticosteroids are not recommended during pregnancy due to potential adverse effects on the fetus."
