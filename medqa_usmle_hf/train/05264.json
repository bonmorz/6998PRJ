Lithium toxicity can cause hypercalcemia but is less likely given the patient's history of bipolar disorder and normal lithium levels. Parathyroid adenoma can also cause hypercalcemia, but the combination of high PTH levels and abnormal calcium sensing receptors makes it less likely."

The patient\u2019s elevated serum calcium and PTH levels, along with a family history of parathyroidectomy, suggest an abnormality in calcium metabolism. Lithium can cause hypercalcemia, but the 24-hour urine calcium level is not elevated. Excess calcium intake would not cause such a high PTH level. The most likely cause is an abnormality in calcium sensing receptors, which are responsible for regulating PTH secretion. Parathyroid adenoma is another possible cause, but the abnormal calcium sensing receptors are more strongly supported by the patient\u2019s history and laboratory findings."
