Systemic corticosteroid administration is contraindicated in COVID-19."

The patient may have COVID-19, as she has recently returned from China and has symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

The most appropriate next step at this stage is to provide supportive therapy and monitoring. Treatment with Lopinavir-ritonavir may be considered in severe cases, and RT-PCR testing can confirm the diagnosis. Systemic corticosteroids are not recommended for initial treatment of COVID-19."
