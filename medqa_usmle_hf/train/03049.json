When nitrous oxide is discontinued, its diffusion out of the body replaces nitrogen with oxygen in the alveoli, resulting in hypoxia. In this case, the patient most likely received nitrous oxide during the procedure and experienced diffusion hypoxia when the anesthesia was stopped. The other options are less likely causes given the circumstances described."

When the nitrous oxide is turned off, the concentration gradient reverses, causing nitrogen to diffuse out of the blood and into the alveoli, leading to hypoxia. This is a common complication that can be prevented by administering 100% oxygen for several minutes before ending anesthesia. The other options may cause hypoxia but are less likely in this scenario."
