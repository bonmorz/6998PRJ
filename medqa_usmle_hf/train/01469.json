The patient is exhibiting a classic symptom of hemiballismus, which is caused by damage to the contralateral subthalamic nucleus. Option A is incorrect because damage to the internal capsule causes contralateral hemiplegia, not hemiballismus. Option B is incorrect because damage to the subthalamic nucleus on the same side as the movements would cause hypokinesia, not hyperkinetic movements. Option D is incorrect because damage to the ventral posterior thalamic nucleus can cause sensory deficits, but not hyperkinetic movements."
