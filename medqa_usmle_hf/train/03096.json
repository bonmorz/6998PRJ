Option A is correct as panic attacks often involve elevated autonomic activity. Option B and C are incorrect as panic attacks can occur at irregular intervals and there is no fixed number of attacks needed for diagnosis. Option D is partially correct as symptoms must be present for at least 1 month, not 3 months."
