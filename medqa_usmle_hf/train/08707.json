This helps to associate the bedroom with sleep and reduce the amount of time spent awake in bed. Relaxation techniques involve specific exercises designed to promote relaxation and reduce anxiety, and improved sleep hygiene involves improving sleep habits and routines. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a broader approach that may include stimulus control therapy, relaxation techniques, and other techniques to address cognitive factors that may be contributing to insomnia."
