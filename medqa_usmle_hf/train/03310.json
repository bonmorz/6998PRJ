Bladder training is a behavioral approach to help manage urinary incontinence and is typically the first-line treatment before considering medication or surgery. Administering antimuscarinics or posterior tibial nerve stimulation may be considered if behavioral therapies fail. Surgery is typically reserved for severe cases or when all other options have failed."
