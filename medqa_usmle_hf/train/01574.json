The patient\u2019s history of smoking and symptoms of shortness of breath and cough suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Bluish discoloration of the tongue and lips is known as cyanosis, which suggests hypoxia, a common complication of COPD. Increased serum hematocrit is a compensatory response to hypoxia, which helps to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure occurs in congestive heart failure, not COPD. Normal FEV1 and increased FEV1/FVC ratio are not typical findings in COPD."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, smoking history, and physical examination findings suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The bluish discoloration of the tongue and lips suggests cyanosis, which is a common finding in patients with COPD. Oxygen levels may be decreased and lead to an increased serum hematocrit as the body compensates by producing more red blood cells. Increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure suggests heart failure, which is less likely. Normal FEV1 and increased FEV1/FVC ratio suggest normal or obstructive lung disease, which is not consistent with the patient\u2019s symptoms of coughing and shortness of breath."

The patient\u2019s smoking history and symptoms suggest chronic bronchitis, a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In COPD, the lungs have difficulty getting enough oxygen and patients often develop polycythemia, a condition in which the body produces too many red blood cells to make up for the lack of oxygen. Increased serum hematocrit is therefore the most likely finding. Increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and decreased FEV1/FVC ratio are more common in other types of COPD, such as emphysema. Normal FEV1 is unlikely in a patient with chronic bronchitis."
