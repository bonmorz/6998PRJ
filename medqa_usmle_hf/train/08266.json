Anorexia nervosa is characterized by a BMI less than 17, so option (C) is the correct answer. The other options are not expected findings in this patient. Iron deficiency anemia is common in anorexia but the serum iron levels may be low. Anorexia can cause dry and brittle skin. Hemoglobin levels can be decreased due to malnutrition."
