The patient presents with symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is a genetic disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness.

Early contractures at multiple joints are also a common finding, but not present in this patient based on the given information. Inability to release grasp after handshake is a sign of myotonic dystrophy, not Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
