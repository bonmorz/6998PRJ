The continuous 'machine-like' murmur, bounding pulses, and indomethacin treatment suggest a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The PDA is formed from the embryonic sixth aortic arch. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). The first branchial cleft contributes to the development of the external auditory meatus and tympanic membrane. The fourth branchial pouch contributes to the development of the parathyroid glands. The sixth branchial pouch contributes to the development of the thymus."
