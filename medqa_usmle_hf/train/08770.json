A CT scan confirms the presence of a collection contiguous with the pancreas. CT-guided percutaneous drainage would be the most appropriate next step in management, as it can help drain the pseudocyst and relieve symptoms. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography may be helpful in identifying the cause of recurrent pancreatitis, but it is not necessary at this moment. Surgical resection of the pancreas may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the first-line treatment for pancreatic pseudocysts."
