Option (C) is correct. Option (A) is incorrect because it only provides the absolute risk of developing PAH in healthy nonsmoking women, but not in the studied population. Option (B) is incorrect because there is no information about the risk of developing PAH in those who quit smoking in the study. Option (D) is incorrect because it only provides the absolute risk of developing PAH in healthy nonsmoking women, which is already stated in option (A)."

Absolute risk is the likelihood of an event occurring in a specific population, while relative risk is the ratio of the incidence of an event in an exposed group to that of a non-exposed group. From the table, we can calculate the incidence of PAH in each group: \n- Smokers: 35/500 = 7% \n- Controls: 20/500 = 4% \nTo calculate the absolute risk increase, we subtract the incidence in controls from that in smokers: 7% - 4% = 3%. Therefore, option (C) is correct. Option (A) is incorrect as it refers to the lifetime absolute risk of developing PAH in healthy nonsmoking women, but the study did not specifically look at that population. Option (B) is incorrect as there is no information provided on the risk reduction from quitting smoking. Option (D) is incorrect as it contradicts the data presented in the table."

To calculate the absolute risk increase of developing PAH in female smokers, we subtract the number of smokers who developed PAH (35) divided by the total number of smokers (500) from the number of controls who developed PAH (20) divided by the total number of controls (500), which gives us 0.03, or 3%.
