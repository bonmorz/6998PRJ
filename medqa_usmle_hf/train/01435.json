The figures show bilateral pitting edema of the lower extremities, which could indicate fluid overload and metabolic alkalosis. The high blood pressure also suggests fluid overload. Hypokalemia is also commonly seen in fluid overload, which is why option C is the correct answer. Hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis would not be expected in this case."

Also, the patient's blood pressure is high, which suggests that he has hypertension. Hypertension and fluid overload can cause the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Therefore, the answer is (C), hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis."

The patient\u2019s skin and nail findings are consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which can be seen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Hypertension can also be a complication of the disease. Hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis can be seen as a side effect of the standard treatment for granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which includes glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide or rituximab."

The physical examination findings are suggestive of Conn's syndrome, which is caused by excess aldosterone production from the adrenal glands.

Hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis are not typically seen in patients with Conn's syndrome."

Serum laboratory studies would be helpful to confirm this suspicion."
