Among the options, the most likely mechanism for repairing apurinic/apyrimidinic sites is base excision repair, which is specifically designed for the repair of damaged or missing nitrogenous bases. Nucleotide excision repair is usually used to repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation, while mismatch repair is used to repair errors during DNA replication. Nonhomologous end joining repair is used to repair double-strand breaks in DNA."

The resulting gap is then filled with a new nucleotide. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) repairs bulky lesions, such as those caused by UV radiation.
