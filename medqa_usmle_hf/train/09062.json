The patient is experiencing pain in the groin and buttocks with no swelling or erythema, which is consistent with avascular necrosis. The past history of hospitalization for abdominal, back, and chest pain may suggest sickle cell anemia, which can cause avascular necrosis as a complication.

Septic arthritis would present with swelling, warmth, and erythema, while proximal femoral osteosarcoma would present with a mass or bony enlargement. Transient synovitis is a possible diagnosis but less likely given the duration of symptoms."
