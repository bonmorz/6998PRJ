The symptoms are suggestive of endometriosis, and the tender, uniformly enlarged boggy uterus is consistent with adenomyosis, which is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue within the uterine wall.

Option A refers to a leiomyoma, which can cause abnormal bleeding, but typically does not cause lower abdominal pain. Option C refers to endometrial hyperplasia, which can also cause abnormal bleeding, but typically does not cause lower abdominal pain. Option D refers to endometritis, which usually presents with fever, chills, and lower abdominal pain."

The passage of clots is consistent with the presence of endometrial tissue within the uterine wall. A previous history of endometrial cancer in the patient's mother increases the risk of endometrial tissue growth. Benign tumors of the myometrium can also cause an enlarged uterus, but they usually do not cause heavy bleeding or pain. Abnormal thickening of endometrial tissue can cause irregular bleeding, but it is not associated with an enlarged uterus or pain. Inflammation of the endometrium is usually associated with infection, which is not suggested by the patient\u2019s history and physical examination findings."
