The presence of grouped vesicles, excoriation marks, and deposits of immunoglobulin A at the tips of dermal papillae are characteristic of dermatitis herpetiformis, which is associated with gliadin-dependent hypersensitivity. Option A describes scabies, which typically presents with burrows and may cause generalized itching but not necessarily grouped vesicles at specific locations. Nail pitting is seen in psoriasis and isn't related to the skin findings described in the question stem. Positive Nikolsky sign is seen in pemphigus vulgaris and other blistering diseases caused by autoantibodies to desmosomal proteins, where rubbing or pressure on the skin causes further separation of the layers of the epidermis."

The description of the skin rash with grouped vesicles and microabscesses in the papillary dermis, along with deposits of immunoglobulin A at the tips of dermal papillae, is most consistent with dermatitis herpetiformis, which is strongly associated with gluten sensitivity and gliadin-dependent hypersensitivity.
