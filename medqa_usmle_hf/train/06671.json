The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of leptospirosis, which is common in tropical regions and can be contracted from contaminated water, such as that in Hawaii after heavy rain. The scleral icterus is suggestive of liver involvement, and the headache and leg pain may be due to meningitis or myalgias. The characteristic finding in leptospirosis is the presence of question mark-shaped bacteria on dark-field microscopy of blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Options A and C suggest ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, or rocky mountain spotted fever, which are tick-borne infections, while option B suggests syphilis."

The patient has been surfing in Hawaii and has symptoms of fever, headache, and photophobia with scleral icterus, which suggests he may have contracted Leptospirosis. The correct answer is Option (D), which describes the diagnostic findings for Leptospirosis, caused by the spirochete bacteria Leptospira interrogans. Option (A) describes the diagnostic findings for Anaplasmosis, Option (B) describes the diagnostic findings for Syphilis, and Option (C) describes the diagnostic findings for Ehrlichiosis, all of which are not the most likely diagnosis for this patient's symptoms."
