The symptoms indicate achondroplasia, a genetic disorder characterized by short limbs and a normal-sized head and torso. Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation that results in overactivation of FGFR3 gene. Option A (underactivation of FGFR3) is associated with hypochondroplasia, a milder form of skeletal dysplasia. Option B (GAA repeat) is associated with Friedrich's ataxia, which involves deterioration of the nervous system and muscles. Option C (deletion of DMD) is associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a condition where the muscles become progressively weaker and damaged."
