Given the patient's recent history of an influenza-like infection and asthma exacerbations, as well as the absence of lymphadenopathy or sore throat, the most likely diagnosis is subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (also known as De Quervain's thyroiditis). This condition is typically self-limiting but causes pain and inflammation in the thyroid gland, leading to symptoms such as difficulty swallowing. Lymphoma is less likely given the absence of lymphadenopathy, and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and fibrous thyroiditis are possible but less likely based on the patient's symptoms and history."

Fibrous thyroiditis is a rare condition that presents with fibrous tissue replacement of thyroid tissue and is not commonly associated with difficulty swallowing."
