Option (B) is the best explanation as the obstruction of dermal lymphatic vessels leads to the characteristic symptoms of redness, swelling, and warmth in inflammatory breast cancer. The other options are incorrect as inflammatory breast cancer is a malignant lesion, does not express hormone receptors, and spreads through lymphatic vessels, but not predominantly."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest inflammatory breast cancer, which is known to cause breast swelling, erythema, and thickening of the skin. The absence of a palpable mass makes the condition less likely to be a benign lesion or a cancer with tumor cells. The warmness, redness, and edema are indicative of obstruction of dermal lymphatic vessels. There is no information to suggest receptors for estrogen and progesterone, so option C can be ruled out. Lymphatic spread is a characteristic of inflammatory breast cancer, but it is not the most likely explanation for the patient\u2019s condition."
