Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke due to the possibility of thrombus formation in the atria, which can then embolize to the brain and cause a stroke. In this case, the EKG finding is not directly related to the acute presentation, but is a risk factor for stroke in general. The acute presentation is likely due to a stroke, as evidenced by the sudden onset of focal neurological deficits. Treatment with tPA is appropriate in this setting, as long as there are no contraindications such as recent surgery or history of bleeding disorders."
