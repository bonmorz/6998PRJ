It involves Southern blotting (a technique used to detect specific DNA sequences) followed by incubation with a labeled oligonucleotide probe specific for the binding site of the protein of interest. Therefore, this technique would be the most appropriate to use in this experiment to identify the presence of the transcription factor motif in the tumor cells. Western blotting involves the detection of specific proteins in a sample, Northern blotting is used to detect specific RNA transcripts, and PCR is a technique used to amplify specific DNA sequences."
