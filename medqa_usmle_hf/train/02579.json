The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest diabetes insipidus (DI) which is caused by either deficient secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland (central DI) or renal insensitivity to ADH (nephrogenic DI). Since the patient has suffered from head injuries, it is most likely that the condition is caused by central DI, which is regulated by the hypothalamus. The supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus is responsible for the synthesis and secretion of ADH, so the most likely option is (A)."
