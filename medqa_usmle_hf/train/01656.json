Bilateral uncal herniation, subfalcine herniation, and tonsillar herniation can also cause similar symptoms, but they involve different structures within the brain."

Bilateral uncal herniation and subfalcine herniation are less likely to affect the sixth cranial nerve, and tonsillar herniation would present with additional symptoms such as respiratory distress."
