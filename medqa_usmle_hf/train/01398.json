The newborn has signs of respiratory distress, including cyanosis, dyspnea, and tachypnea, and an x-ray shows left-sided diaphragmatic hernia, which requires prompt treatment. Intubation and mechanical ventilation are the most appropriate initial steps to stabilize the patient and improve oxygenation. Other options may be necessary later depending on the severity of the diaphragmatic hernia. Extracorporeal life support may be necessary if the patient does not respond to initial treatment, surfactant administration may be indicated for respiratory distress syndrome rather than diaphragmatic hernia, and surgical repair may be necessary but is not the initial step in management."

The most appropriate initial step in management is to intubate and provide mechanical ventilation to correct the hypoxemia and prevent further lung collapse until a chest tube can be inserted to treat the pneumothorax. Extracorporeal life support is a last resort option after failed conventional respiratory support. Surfactant administration is used for newborns with respiratory distress syndrome but it\u2019s not the most appropriate option for a newborn with a pneumothorax. Surgical repair is required for a chronic pneumothorax but not for an acute one that can be managed with chest tube insertion."
