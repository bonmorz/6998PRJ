The patient has not had a menstrual period for the past 4 months with irregular periods over the past year, which together suggest premature ovarian failure. The lab results of low estradiol and high FSH and LH support this diagnosis. Pregnancy can be ruled out as the patient is sexually active and not using condoms. Polycystic ovary syndrome would have elevated LH and normal FSH levels. Primary hypothyroidism can also cause irregular periods, but the lab results do not support this diagnosis."
