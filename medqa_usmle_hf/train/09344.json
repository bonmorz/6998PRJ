The symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency (BH4 deficiency), specifically dihydropteridine reductase deficiency, which affects the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase. This results in elevated phenylalanine levels and neurotransmitter deficiencies, leading to the clinical symptoms. Dopamine hydroxylase deficiency and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase deficiency both affect the synthesis of norepinephrine and epinephrine, which are not related to the symptoms. Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency would also result in elevated phenylalanine levels but would not cause neurotransmitter deficiencies."
