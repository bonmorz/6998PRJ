The patient\u2019s cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing suggest a respiratory problem, and among the options, the most likely cause is progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow, which is commonly seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient\u2019s history of smoking for 40 years also increases the likelihood of COPD. Local accumulation of kinins is associated with hereditary angioedema and allergic reactions, while chronic decrease in pulmonary compliance and incremental loss of functional residual capacity are seen in conditions like pulmonary fibrosis and aging, but they do not fit the patient\u2019s presentation as well as option C."
