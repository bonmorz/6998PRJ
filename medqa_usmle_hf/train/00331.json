The white lace-like lines on the buccal mucosa suggest lichen planus, and the rash on the legs is likely to be cutaneous lichen planus. Cutaneous lichen planus is characterized by lymphocytes at the dermoepidermal junction, which makes option B the correct answer. Decreased thickness of the stratum granulosum is a characteristic of psoriasis, proliferation of vascular endothelium is seen in pyogenic granuloma, and deposition of antibodies around epidermal cells is seen in pemphigus vulgaris."

The photograph of the rash also shows flat-topped, polygonal, violaceous papules with scale, which is a classic presentation of lichen planus. Option (A) is incorrect because lichen planus does not involve the stratum granulosum. Option (C) is incorrect because vascular proliferation is not a characteristic feature of lichen planus. Option (D) is incorrect because deposition of antibodies is not characteristic of lichen planus."

In lichen planus, lymphocytes infiltrate at the dermoepidermal junction, causing thickening of the papillary dermis and basal vacuolization. Therefore, a biopsy specimen of the skin lesion is most likely to show lymphocytes at the dermoepidermal junction. Option A is incorrect because lichen planus doesn't affect the thickness of the stratum granulosum. Option C is incorrect because proliferation of vascular endothelium typically appears in conditions like Kaposi sarcoma, not lichen planus. Option D is incorrect because deposition of antibodies around epidermal cells is characteristic of pemphigus vulgaris, not lichen planus."
