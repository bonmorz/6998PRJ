The patient\u2019s inability to completely void and fullness in the suprapubic region, along with a bladder scan showing 450cc, suggest urinary retention. The next appropriate step in management is catheterization. Oral bethanechol chloride is used to treat urinary retention caused by poor bladder muscle function. Intravenous neostigmine methylsulfate is used for the same purpose, but it also carries potential side effects. Intravenous furosemide is used to treat fluid overload and has no role in treating urinary retention."
