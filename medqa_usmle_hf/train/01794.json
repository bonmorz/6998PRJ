The patient complains of frequent urination, weak urinary stream, and waking up at night to urinate, all of which are common symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). The patient's medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephrolithiasis may increase the risk of developing BPH. The prostate exam indicates a slightly enlarged but nontender prostate, which is also consistent with BPH. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia."

The patient has a weak urinary stream, frequent urination, and nocturia, which are all symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Neurogenic bladder typically presents with difficulty urinating or urinary retention, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Prostate cancer and urethral stricture can also cause urinary symptoms, but the lack of blood in the urine and normal prostate exam make them less likely. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is BPH."

The patient has a 1-year history of frequent urination with a weak stream, waking up at night to urinate, and no pain or blood in the urine. He also has an enlarged prostate on rectal exam. These symptoms suggest a diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Neurogenic bladder would have more neurological symptoms or a history of spinal cord injury. Prostate cancer would have elevated levels of PSA or abnormal prostate exam findings. Urethral stricture would have a history of injury or instrumentation."

The patient has a 1-year history of frequent urination with waking up at least 3 times a night to urinate and a weak urinary stream. Past medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus and essential tremor. Medications include metformin, canagliflozin, and propranolol. Physical examination shows an enlarged prostate. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Neurogenic bladder presents with urinary incontinence and often has an underlying neurological condition. Prostate cancer typically presents with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels or abnormal findings on digital rectal exam. Urethral stricture often presents with difficulty urinating and weak urinary stream. None of these findings were present in this patient."

The patient has a 1-year history of frequent urination, a weak urinary stream, and wakes up at least 3 times at night to urinate, suggesting a urological problem. The slightly enlarged but smooth, nontender prostate on rectal examination is consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is a common cause of lower urinary tract symptoms in men. Neurogenic bladder, prostate cancer, and urethral stricture are less likely given the absence of relevant historical and physical exam findings."
