Von Willebrand disease is the most likely cause, as it is a common bleeding disorder characterized by mucocutaneous bleeding and menorrhagia, and has a normal platelet count and prolonged bleeding time. PT is usually normal in this condition."

The normal platelet count and prolonged PTT rule out Hemophilia A and Lupus anticoagulant, which would show abnormal coagulation parameters. Protein C deficiency would also show abnormal coagulation parameters, but it is less likely given the patient's unremarkable physical examination."
