The patient was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision and has shortness of breath, severe pain, absent breath sounds on the left and diffuse crepitus at the left shoulder level. These symptoms indicate that the most likely cause is a flail chest, which occurs when three or more adjacent ribs are fractured in two or more places, causing a segment of the chest wall to move paradoxically during inspiration and expiration. It can cause respiratory distress and may require mechanical ventilation. Phrenic nerve paralysis can cause breathing difficulties but does not cause absent breath sounds. Cardiac tamponade and sternal fracture often present with other specific symptoms such as chest pain and dyspnea."
