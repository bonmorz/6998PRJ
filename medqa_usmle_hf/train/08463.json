Based on the symptoms, the medication is most likely a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which is frequently used as a first-line treatment for major depressive disorder. The most frequently encountered side effects of SSRIs include anorgasmia (difficulty reaching orgasm), insomnia, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Hypomania and suicidal thoughts are potential side effects of antidepressant medications, but they are not specific to SSRIs and are more commonly associated with tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors."

While hypomania and suicidal thoughts are possible side effects of antidepressants, they are not the most frequently encountered ones for SSRIs. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants are also used to treat depression but are considered second- or third-line options due to their more significant side effect profiles."
