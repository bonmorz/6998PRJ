The symptoms suggest that the baby may have a congenital anomaly called tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia, which means that the fourth and sixth branchial arches, which normally give rise to the trachea and esophagus, respectively, have failed to separate properly during fetal development. This results in a single opening that connects the trachea and esophagus, making intubation difficult and increasing the risk of aspiration."
