The patient is presenting with signs of hyperprolactinemia, which can be caused by various conditions including pregnancy. However, the urine pregnancy test came back negative, so other causes should be investigated. Thyroid dysfunction is a common cause of hyperprolactinemia and a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level test can help rule it out. Mammogram and MRI of the head are not indicated at this point, and the serum follicle-stimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone ratio is not helpful in this scenario."

Mammogram and magnetic resonance imaging of the head are not indicated at this time, and serum follicle-stimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone ratio may be checked if the initial testing is inconclusive."
