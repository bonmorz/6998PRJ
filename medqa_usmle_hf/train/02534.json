The inferior mesenteric nodes drain the distal colon, while the superficial inguinal nodes drain the lower extremities and genitals. The left supraclavicular nodes are the location of Virchow's node, which is often indicative of metastatic disease from abdominal organs, but is not the primary drainage site for cervical cancer."
