The patient is showing signs of hypercortisolism, such as weight gain, hirsutism, ecchymotic patches, and muscle weakness. The high blood pressure and hypokalemia support the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome. Primary hyperaldosteronism also causes hypertension and hypokalemia, but it does not typically present with the other symptoms. Polycystic ovarian syndrome can cause irregular menses, but it is not associated with hypercortisolism. Hypothyroidism does not typically cause these symptoms."

Primary hyperaldosteronism would present with hypertension and hypokalemia but without the other symptoms present in this case.

Hypothyroidism may cause fatigue and irregular menses but would not explain the other physical findings or abnormal lab values."
