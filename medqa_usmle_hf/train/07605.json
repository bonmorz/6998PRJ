The presentation suggests a possible knee joint infection, and the growth of gram-negative diplococci indicates a high likelihood of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The treatment of choice for uncomplicated gonococcal arthritis is ceftriaxone monotherapy, with joint aspiration for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Therefore, the correct answer is (D). Nafcillin and oxacillin are not effective against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and vancomycin is not the preferred treatment for joint infections."
