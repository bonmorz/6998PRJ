This patient likely has Rh incompatibility, which occurs when the mother\u2019s blood is Rh-negative and the baby is Rh-positive. The mother\u2019s body makes antibodies against the Rh factor and these antibodies can cross the placenta and cause hemolysis of the baby\u2019s red blood cells, leading to increased bilirubin levels and jaundice in the baby. The correct answer is transfer of Anti-A antibodies, as the patient\u2019s mother is Rh-negative and the baby\u2019s blood group is A, which does not match the mother\u2019s blood group. The other options are not relevant to this patient\u2019s presentation."

The newborn\u2019s jaundice is most likely caused by hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) which is caused by the transfer of maternal antibodies that attack fetal red blood cells. In this case, the mother is Rh-negative and the baby is Rh-negative, but the mother has developed antibodies against the baby\u2019s A antigen, causing hemolysis and resulting in high levels of bilirubin. Viral infiltration of bone marrow and bilary tract atresia are not consistent with the presentation. Polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin is not a cause of the baby\u2019s jaundice."
