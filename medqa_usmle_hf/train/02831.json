Meat is a stimulus for the release of secretin, a hormone that promotes the secretion of bicarbonate by the pancreas and inhibits secretion of acid by the stomach. Therefore, the most likely answer is (C): increased release of secretin. Increased gastrin release (A) would lead to an increase in proton secretion, not a decrease. Cholecystokinin (B) is released in response to fatty meals and stimulates the gallbladder to release bile, so decreased release is not expected with a meaty meal. Ach release (D) from the vagus nerve stimulates gastric acid secretion, so decreased release is not expected with a meaty meal."

Meat consumption stimulates the release of secretin, which inhibits gastric hormone secretion and increases bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Increased release of secretin from S cells of the duodenum. Option (A) is incorrect because increased gastrin release leads to an increase in proton secretion. Option (B) is incorrect because Cholecystokinin release is increased after a meal rich in protein and fat. Option (D) is incorrect because Ach release from the vagus nerve is actually increased after the ingestion of food, leading to increased activity in the digestive tract."

Gastrin stimulates acid secretion, and histamine stimulates H2 receptors, which also stimulate acid secretion. Therefore, option A is not correct. Cholecystokinin is released in response to the presence of fat and protein in the small intestine and stimulates the release of bile from the gallbladder. Therefore, option B is not correct. Secretin is released in response to acid in the duodenum and stimulates the pancreas to release bicarbonate to neutralize the acid. Therefore, option C is correct. Ach, or acetylcholine, is the main neurotransmitter responsible for gastric motility and acid secretion, so its decrease would not be expected in this situation. Therefore, option D is not correct."

Meat consumption stimulates the release of secretin from S cells of the duodenum, which regulates the pH of the small intestine by promoting bicarbonate-rich pancreatic juice secretion. Therefore, (C) is the most likely answer. The other options are not consistent with the hormonal changes that occur during digestion. Increased gastrin release generally leads to an increase in proton secretion, decreased cholecystokinin release impacts gallbladder function, and decreased Ach release from the vagus nerve can impact digestion in the stomach."

Secretin is released from the S cells of the duodenum in response to the acidic chyme entering the small intestine, which then stimulates the pancreatic secretions of bicarbonate to neutralize the acid. Therefore, increased release of secretin from S cells is the most likely change to occur in this test subject after eating the platter of meat riblets and beef strips. Option A is incorrect because increased gastrin release would lead to an increase in proton secretion. Option B is incorrect because cholecystokinin is released in response to fat in the chyme and causes the release of bile and pancreatic enzymes. Option D is incorrect because Ach from the vagus nerve stimulates gastric acid secretion."

Cholecystokinin (CCK) is released in response to fats, and its release leads to increased secretion of digestive enzymes and inhibition of gastric emptying. Therefore, option (B) is also incorrect as the patient ate meat riblets and beef strips. Secretin, on the other hand, is released in response to the acid in the duodenum and stimulates secretion of bicarbonate from the pancreas to neutralize the acid. Thus, option (C) is the correct answer. Ach release from the vagus nerve is important in stimulating gastric acid secretion, and is not likely to decrease after a high protein meal."
