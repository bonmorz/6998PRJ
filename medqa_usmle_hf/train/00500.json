The patient also shows physical characteristics that are consistent with Down syndrome, which increases the likelihood of having congenital abnormalities such as duodenal atresia.

Hirschsprung\u2019s disease and meconium ileus may also present with feeding intolerance and abdominal distention, but they do not have the classic \u201cdouble bubble\u201d sign on an x-ray."
