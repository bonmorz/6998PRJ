Atrial septal defects and coarctation of the aorta can also cause left-to-right shunts, but they usually do not present with a continuous murmur. Tetralogy of Fallot presents with cyanosis and clubbing, but it is not a left-to-right shunt."

The patient's symptoms of exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and occasional respiratory infections suggest a congenital heart disease, and the continuous machine-like murmur suggests Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). PDA causes blood to flow from the aorta to the pulmonary artery, creating pulmonary over circulation and leading to the patient's symptoms. Toe cyanosis and clubbing are common signs in PDA patients, but not specific to this condition. Atrial septal defect and coarctation of the aorta do not typically present with a continuous machine-like murmur. Tetralogy of Fallot has a systolic ejection murmur and does not typically present with toe cyanosis and clubbing."

Coarctation of the aorta would typically present with arm-leg blood pressure differences, absent or weak femoral pulses, and a late-peaking systolic murmur. Tetralogy of Fallot could present with cyanosis, but it would be maximal at the lips and not just in toes, and there would be a single second heart sound instead of a continuous murmur."
