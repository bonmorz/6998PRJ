The gray membrane is a characteristic feature of the illness. The bacterial toxin responsible for this condition is an A/B toxin that ADP ribosylates EF-2, blocking protein synthesis in the host cell. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). Options A and B are incorrect because they describe the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and tetanus toxin, respectively, which are not associated with diphtheria. Option D is incorrect because muscle cell necrosis is not a feature of diphtheria."

The culture also reveals black colonies, which are characteristic of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the organism responsible for diphtheria. From here, we can deduce that the mechanism of action of the bacterial toxin responsible for this condition is ADP-ribosylation of EF-2, which inhibits protein synthesis and causes tissue damage. This is the mechanism of action for the diphtheria toxin produced by C. diphtheriae. Option A refers to botulinum toxin, option B refers to tetanus toxin, and option D refers to the alpha toxin produced by Clostridium perfringens."
