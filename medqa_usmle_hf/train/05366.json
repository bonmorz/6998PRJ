The specificity of the test, however, should remain relatively unaffected by prevalence. Therefore, option A is the correct answer, as only the sensitivity would be affected."

In an area with a low prevalence of the disease, there will be more false positives, which will decrease the specificity of the test. Sensitivity, however, is not affected by disease prevalence.
