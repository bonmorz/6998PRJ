The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with superficial thrombophlebitis, including pain, swelling, redness, and a cordlike feel to the affected vein. Duplex ultrasound findings further support this diagnosis. Erythema nodosum is a rash that presents in a bilateral and symmetrical manner on the lower legs, which is not consistent with the patient\u2019s findings. Deep vein thrombosis can also present with pain and swelling, but the location of the cordlike feel is different. Varicose veins typically appear as bulging, twisting veins that can cause discomfort but do not usually present with a palpable cord."

Deep vein thrombosis would present with similar symptoms but would occur in larger veins and have a higher risk of embolism. Erythema nodosum is a skin condition that presents with tender red nodules on the shins or other parts of the body, but it doesn't involve the veins. Varicose veins would present with larger protruding veins, but not necessarily the symptoms described here."
