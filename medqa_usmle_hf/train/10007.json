Chronic bronchitis and rales suggest a pulmonary problem but do not give any indications towards reproductive system abnormalities such as an ovarian mass. In stress urinary incontinence, the bladder neck and urethra are weakened and can lead to a cystocele, which is the protrusion of the bladder into the vaginal wall. Therefore, option D is most likely to be revealed by the gynecologic examination."
