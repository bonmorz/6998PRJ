The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that he has glycogen storage disease type II (Pompe disease). The enlarged cheeks are likely due to glycogen accumulation in the lysosomes of muscle cells, resulting in hypertrophy of the heart and tongue. The low blood glucose level indicates hypoglycemia, and the fasting-state glucagon stimulation test is used to diagnose glycogen storage diseases. In glycogen storage disease type II, there is no change in plasma glucose levels because there is a deficiency of alpha-1,4-glucosidase (acid maltase), which is needed for glycogen breakdown."

The patient's symptoms and the abnormally enlarged cheeks suggest a diagnosis of Pompe disease, which is caused by a deficiency in alpha-1,4-glucosidase. The patient's low blood glucose level indicates hypoglycemia, which is a common symptom in Pompe disease. In a fasting state, the patient's response to glucagon stimulation would be no change in plasma glucose. This is because the body is unable to break down glycogen and release glucose into the bloodstream, due to the deficient enzyme."
