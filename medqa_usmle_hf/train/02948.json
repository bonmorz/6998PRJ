The harsh-sounding, holosystolic murmur best appreciated at the left sternal border is indicative of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The increase in intensity with fist-clenching is known as the grip test, and is consistent with VSD. Aortic stenosis typically causes a systolic ejection murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border. Tricuspid atresia is characterized by a lack of a tricuspid valve and is usually associated with a single S2 heart sound. Left ventricular hypertrophy can cause a variety of findings on cardiac examination, but typically does not cause a holosystolic murmur."
