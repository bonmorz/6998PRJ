The most appropriate initial step in the treatment of this patient is to start doxycycline, which is effective against Borrelia burgdorferi. Ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin are not recommended as first-line treatment for Lyme disease. Rifampin may be used in certain situations, but not as initial treatment for Lyme disease."
