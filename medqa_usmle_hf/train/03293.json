The postpartum hemorrhage and difficulty with lactation suggest Sheehan's syndrome, which is caused by pituitary gland damage due to severe blood loss during childbirth. Prolactin is produced by the pituitary gland, so a decreased prolactin level is expected in this case. Thyroid releasing hormone (TRH) stimulates the release of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland, which then stimulates the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormone. A decreased TRH level would result in decreased TSH and thyroid hormone levels, but this is not expected in Sheehan's syndrome. Increased FSH and LH levels would indicate primary ovarian failure, which is not associated with Sheehan's syndrome."
