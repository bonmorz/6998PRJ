Ipratropium is an anticholinergic medication that blocks the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, thus interfering with the pathway that leads to increased airway resistance. Epinephrine is a bronchodilator that acts on beta-2 adrenergic receptors to promote relaxation of smooth muscles. Theophylline acts as a bronchodilator by inhibiting the breakdown of cyclic AMP. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that also acts on beta-receptors but would not directly interfere with the muscarinic acetylcholine pathway described."
