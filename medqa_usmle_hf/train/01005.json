The pedigree chart shows that the condition affecting the child's vision runs in the family and is more common in males. This suggests that the mode of inheritance is X-linked recessive, as females have two X chromosomes and would need two copies of the gene to be affected. The child's mother may be a carrier of the gene and has a 50% chance of passing it on to her male children. Mitochondrial inheritance and Y-linked dominant inheritance are rare and unlikely explanations in this case. Autosomal recessive inheritance would require the child to inherit a copy of the gene from both parents, which is not suggested by the pedigree chart."

Autosomal recessive inheritance would require both parents to be unaffected carriers, which is not shown in the pedigree. Y-linked dominant inheritance would only affect males in the family, but there are affected females as well. X-linked recessive inheritance is consistent with the pattern seen in the pedigree, with affected males and carrier females. Therefore, the most likely cause of the changes in the patient's vision involves X-linked recessive inheritance."

Females are carriers because they have two X chromosomes and will only be affected if both chromosomes carry the mutation.
