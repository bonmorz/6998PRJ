The patient's history of prolonged mechanical ventilation, need for high fraction of inspired oxygen, and significant respiratory distress and wheezing suggest the most likely diagnosis is Bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Bronchiolitis obliterans is less likely given the patient's history."

The patient has a history of intubation and mechanical ventilation, which are risk factors for bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The symptoms, including labored breathing, crackles, and x-ray findings, also support this diagnosis. Atelectasis and hyperinflation are common findings in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Bronchiolitis obliterans typically presents with wheezing and obstructive symptoms, but without crackles or x-ray findings. Meconium aspiration syndrome can present with respiratory distress and crackles, but typically occurs at birth or shortly after. Pulmonary hypoplasia is rare and typically presents with severe respiratory distress and hypoxia at birth."

Atelectasis is a frequent finding, and hyperinflation and wheezing may also be present. Meconium aspiration syndrome can cause respiratory distress but it usually occurs around birth. Pulmonary hypoplasia is a rare condition that occurs when the lungs don't develop properly, and it would have been diagnosed earlier in life. Bronchiolitis obliterans affects the small airways of the lungs and is less common in infants."
