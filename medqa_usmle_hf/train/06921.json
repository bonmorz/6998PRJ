The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest patellofemoral pain syndrome, which is characterized by pain in the anterior area of the knee during activities such as running, squatting, and walking up and down stairs. Testing for pain upon compression of the patella while the patient performs flexion and extension of the leg is a common maneuver to diagnose the condition. Excessive anterior or posterior displacement of the tibia is seen in other conditions such as ACL injuries, while pain upon pressure on the medial aspect of the knee suggests a meniscal injury."

Excessive anterior displacement of the tibia (option A) suggests patellar instability, excessive posterior displacement of the tibia (option B) suggests posterior cruciate ligament injury, and pain upon pressure placed on the medial aspect of the knee (option D) suggests medial collateral ligament injury, but none of these match the patient's symptoms."
