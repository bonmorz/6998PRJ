The symptoms of hoarseness and difficulty swallowing, along with a hard nontender anterior neck swelling that does not move with swallowing, suggest thyroid cancer. The physical examination findings of decreased peripheral pulses suggest a possible complication of tumor invasion in the blood vessels. Collagen deposition and decreased follicles are more commonly seen with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Spindle cells and areas of focal necrosis are more common with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Giant cells and noncaseating granulomas are seen with granulomatous thyroiditis. Lymphocytic infiltrate and germinal center formation are seen with Hashimoto's thyroiditis."

The dry skin and swelling of the lower extremities suggest hypothyroidism, and the most likely finding on biopsy of the thyroid mass is collagen deposition and decreased follicles, which are characteristic features of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease that causes hypothyroidism. Spindle cells and focal necrosis are seen in some types of sarcomas, giant cells and noncaseating granulomas are seen in granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis, and lymphocytic infiltrate and germinal center formation are seen in lymphomas and other lymphoid disorders. However, based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most likely diagnosis."
