The patient\u2019s history of rheumatoid arthritis and the presence of multiple joint deformities, along with the presence of nodules, suggests Felty syndrome. The laboratory findings also support this diagnosis, as patients with Felty syndrome typically have a low white blood cell count and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma and T cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia would be less likely due to the absence of lymphadenopathy and a normal leukocyte count, while sarcoidosis is less likely given the absence of other typical symptoms such as pulmonary involvement."
