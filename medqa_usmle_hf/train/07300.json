The drug is increasing the amount of iminodiacetic acid in the intestines, which suggests the drug is stimulating the secretion of bile. Bile is produced by hepatocytes in the liver and stored in the gallbladder, but it is released into the duodenum when food arrives in the small intestine. Bile secretion is regulated by hormones such as cholecystokinin and secretin, which are produced by the intestinal mucosa. Jejunal I cells are responsible for secreting cholecystokinin, which stimulates the release of bile from the gallbladder and pancreatic enzymes. Therefore, the effect of the novel drug is most similar to the effect of cholecystokinin, which is secreted by jejunal I cells."
