The presentation of limping and pain in the knee with passive hip motion and the X-ray findings of a flattened femoral head suggest Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease. Rickets can cause bone deformities and pain but does not typically present with hip symptoms. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may present with a limp and pain in the hip or knee, but X-rays would show a slip of the femoral head rather than a flattened appearance. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis typically presents with joint swelling and stiffness, and X-rays would show joint changes rather than specific hip findings."
