The other options are not involved in the lumbar puncture procedure. The denticulate ligament helps to anchor the spinal cord to the dura mater. The pia layer is the layer that directly covers the spinal cord. The anterior longitudinal ligament is located in the front part of the vertebral column and helps to support it."
