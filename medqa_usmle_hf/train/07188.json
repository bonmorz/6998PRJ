The leukocyte count is high, and abdominal tenderness and distension are present. The most likely finding in an abdominal x-ray is the dilation of the colon with loss of haustration, which is a sign of toxic megacolon, a potentially life-threatening complication of severe colitis. Options B, C, and D do not fit the clinical picture of the patient."

The patient presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which are suggestive of acute gastroenteritis. The leukocyte count suggests infection or inflammation. The dilated abdomen with tenderness in lower quadrants, and hypoactive bowel sounds are indicative of colonic distension. The positive stool test for occult blood and the laboratory findings including low potassium and increased leukocyte count suggest gastrointestinal bleeding. Together, these findings are consistent with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease. An abdominal X-ray would most likely show dilation of the colon with loss of haustration, which is a common finding in colitis or inflammatory bowel disease. Options (B), (C), and (D) are less likely to be seen on an abdominal X-ray in this situation."
