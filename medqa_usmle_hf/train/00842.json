The patient has symptoms of orbital cellulitis, which is a potentially serious infection of the eye and surrounding tissues. The fact that eye movements are restricted and painful in all directions indicates involvement of the extraocular muscles and suggests that the infection is spreading rapidly. Pain with eye movements provides the strongest indication for administering intravenous antibiotics to prevent further spread of the infection to the brain. The other options (worsening of ocular pain, leukocytosis, purulent nasal discharge and right cheek tenderness) are also important indications for antibiotic therapy, but they are not as urgent as pain with eye movements."

Worsening of ocular pain also supports the diagnosis of orbital cellulitis but is not as strong an indication as pain with eye movements."
