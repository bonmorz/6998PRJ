The symptoms suggest the patient may be experiencing acute mountain sickness, which can lead to respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation. Hyperventilation is caused by low partial pressure of alveolar oxygen, which stimulates the respiratory center to increase breathing rate to compensate for low oxygen levels at high altitude. This leads to decreased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide and subsequently respiratory alkalosis. None of the other answer choices are related to the initial stimulus for acid-base disorder in this scenario."
