When the body recognizes a pathogen, it increases the activity of warm-sensitive neurons in the anterior hypothalamus, leading to vasoconstriction and shivering, and thus raising the body temperature to create an inhospitable environment for the pathogen. Once the pathogen is eradicated, feedback mechanisms return the body to the normal temperature set point, facilitated by the anterior hypothalamus."
