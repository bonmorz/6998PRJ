The hoarse voice and frequent throat clearing indicate possible acid reflux. Adding a proton pump inhibitor can help alleviate the GERD symptoms and possibly improve asthma symptoms as well. Oral prednisone may be necessary for an asthma exacerbation or flare-up, but that is not indicated in this case as the pulmonary function test result is not suggestive of a severe asthma exacerbation. Salmeterol inhaler can be considered if the patient's symptoms are not adequately controlled with the current inhaler regimen, but GERD should still be addressed first. Total serum IgE levels are not necessary at this point as the patient's diagnosis of asthma has already been established, and the symptoms suggest another issue causing exacerbation."
