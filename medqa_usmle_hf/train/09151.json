The arrow is pointing to the Fc region of the immunoglobulin, which is responsible for fixing complement and initiating the complement cascade. This event is important for enhancing the immune response against pathogens in the fetus. The other options are not primarily associated with the Fc region. Formation of dimer is mediated by covalent disulfide bonds between two separate immunoglobulin molecules. Attachment to antigen is primarily mediated by the Fab region of the immunoglobulin, and determination of idiotype is mediated by the unique variable region of the immunoglobulin."
