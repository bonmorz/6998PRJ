The symptoms suggest the patient may have ankylosing spondylitis, and the reduced lumbar flexion and tenderness over the sacroiliac joints confirm the diagnosis. The most appropriate next step in management would be to perform a PPD skin test to evaluate for tuberculosis prior to initiating biologic therapy. This is because biologic therapy is associated with an increased risk of TB reactivation, and a PPD skin test is required before initiation of therapy.
