Systemic sclerosis can cause pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is characterized by elevated pulmonary artery pressure. Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor that enhances nitric oxide signaling, leading to vasodilation and improved blood flow. Thus, the expected beneficial effect of tadalafil is due to enhanced activity of nitric oxide."
