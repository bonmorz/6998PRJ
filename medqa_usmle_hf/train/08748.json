The symptoms and laboratory findings suggest Microscopic polyangiitis, which is characterized by pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis, lung capillaritis, and systemic vasculitis involving small vessels. C-ANCA is typically negative, and anti-MPO/PR3 levels are usually elevated. Churg-Strauss syndrome involves eosinophilic inflammation and PAN is a necrotizing vasculitis which affects medium-sized arteries. Disseminated tuberculosis can present with respiratory symptoms and systemic symptoms, but it does not typically involve glomerulonephritis."
