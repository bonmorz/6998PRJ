Urinalysis is a simple and non-invasive test that can help rule out renal disease as a cause of her hypertension. Cortisol levels can be checked if Cushing's syndrome is suspected, but there are no indications for it at this point. Renal artery doppler ultrasonography is indicated if renovascular hypertension is suspected, but again, there are no indications for it at this point. Thyroid-stimulating hormone is indicated if hypothyroidism is suspected but is unlikely given the patient's presentation."

The patient presents with multiple risk factors for chronic kidney disease such as morbid obesity, hypertension, and a family history of kidney failure. The palpable pulses in distal extremities suggest no significant peripheral artery disease. The droopy eyelids, thick neck, and large tongue suggest a possible obstructive sleep apnea, which can lead to hypertension and chronic kidney disease. A urinalysis can help detect any early markers of kidney disease. Cortisol levels and thyroid-stimulating hormone are less relevant in this case.

A urinalysis can help identify any underlying kidney disease, which would require further evaluation and management.

However, given the patient\u2019s history of a family member with kidney failure, a urinalysis to check for proteinuria should be done first to rule out any kidney disease.
