The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest postpartum hemorrhage, which can occur due to uterine atony or cervical or vaginal lacerations. However, the uterine fundus is firm, so uterine atony is unlikely. Observation and close monitoring is the appropriate next step, especially since the bleeding is bright red and the patient\u2019s vitals are stable. Pelvic ultrasound or administration of antibiotics would not be indicated at this time. Hysterectomy would only be considered in severe cases of postpartum hemorrhage that cannot be managed with conservative measures."

Pelvic ultrasound may be considered if there is concern for retained products of conception or abscess formation. Hysterectomy is not indicated for postpartum endometritis.
