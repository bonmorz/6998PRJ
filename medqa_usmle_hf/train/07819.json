The patient is presenting with symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left popliteal vein, and a hyperechoic mass is visible on the ultrasound. The most appropriate next step in management would be to perform a chest X-ray to check for pulmonary embolism, as that is a potential complication of DVT. Colonoscopy is not relevant to this case. An inferior vena cava filter may be considered if anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated or ineffective, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Streptokinase therapy is not commonly used for DVT management and has been largely replaced by other anticoagulants."
