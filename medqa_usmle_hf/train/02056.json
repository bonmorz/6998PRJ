These IgE antibodies bind to mast cells and basophils. When the allergen re-enters the body, it binds to the IgE on the mast cells and basophils, triggering the release of histamine and other chemicals that cause allergic symptoms. IL-4 plays a key role in the production of IgE antibodies and is therefore the most involved in generating the antibodies necessary for mast cell Fc-receptor cross-linking and degranulation."
