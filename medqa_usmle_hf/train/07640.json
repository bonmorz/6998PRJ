Antibiotics are not indicated for viral infections like the common cold, and prescribing them unnecessarily can lead to antibiotic resistance.

Prescribing antibiotics or referring the mother to another physician who will prescribe antibiotics is not an appropriate response. Prescribing a placebo would also not be ethical.
