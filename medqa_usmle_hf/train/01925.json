Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred treatment for this condition, as it involves opening up the blocked coronary artery to restore blood flow to the heart muscle. Beta blockers and clopidogrel may also be used in the treatment of ACS, but PCI is the most effective intervention in reducing mortality and morbidity. Thrombolytics may also be used in the event that PCI is not available within a timely manner, but this carries a higher risk of bleeding complications."

The patient presents with symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction, evidenced by the severe chest pain, additional S4 sound on cardiac auscultation, and ST elevation on ECG. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the mainstay of treatment for acute myocardial infarction and has been shown to improve outcomes compared to thrombolytics. Beta blockers are given after PCI to reduce the risk of further cardiac events. Clopidogrel can be used in conjunction with PCI. Thrombolytics are no longer the preferred treatment for acute myocardial infarction unless PCI is not available."
