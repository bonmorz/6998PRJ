The medication mentioned is most likely azathioprine, which is converted to 6-mercaptopurine in the body and is used to suppress the immune system to prevent organ rejection. A potential side effect of azathioprine is bone marrow suppression, which can manifest as pancytopenia. Therefore, the patient should be monitored for possible development of pancytopenia. Hyperlipidemia and osteoporosis are not associated with azathioprine use. Cytokine storm is a severe immune reaction that is not related to azathioprine use."
