Interleukin-1 is a cytokine that stimulates the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells, allowing leukocytes to adhere and migrate to the site of injury.

Interleukin-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that inhibits the expression of adhesion molecules. Interleukin-6 is a cytokine involved in the inflammatory response, but not specifically in the expression of adhesion molecules.
