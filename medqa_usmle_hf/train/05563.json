The patient\u2019s symptoms and risk factors suggest lung cancer, and the low potassium level in the blood indicates possible adrenal gland involvement. Kulchitsky cells are neuroendocrine cells found in the lungs and are associated with small cell lung carcinoma, which is the most common type of lung cancer associated with adrenal gland involvement. Therefore, the nodule is most likely to exhibit Kulchitsky cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. Glandular cells with mucin are more common in adenocarcinoma, squamous cells with keratin pearls are more common in squamous cell carcinoma, and pleomorphic giant cells are more commonly found in sarcoma."
