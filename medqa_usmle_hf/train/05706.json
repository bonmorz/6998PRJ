The patient has been receiving EPO to treat his anemia, but his continued fatigue suggests that the treatment is not working as expected. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, which is still low. In order to determine the cause of the patient's persistent anemia, we would look at the MCV, RDW, ferritin, and transferrin saturation. The correct answer is (B), which describes a pattern of low MCV and increased RDW, indicating a mix of small and large red blood cells. Both ferritin and transferrin saturation are low, indicating a decreased amount of iron available for red blood cell production. This pattern suggests iron deficiency anemia, which may be caused by factors such as chronic blood loss from dialysis or more acute gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient may need further evaluation and treatment for iron deficiency, in addition to continued EPO therapy."
