The clinical presentation of red lesions with slight pain and a low-grade fever, along with the presence of multinucleated epithelial giant cells on Tzanck smear, suggests a herpes simplex infection. The patient\u2019s observation of a small vesicular eruption on his finger that merged with other eruptions and became cloudy is also consistent with a herpes simplex infection. Herpangina would present with small blisters and ulcers in the mouth and throat, but not on the lips. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease would present with blisters and ulcers on the hands, feet, and mouth, but not on the lips. Measles presents with a rash and fever, but not with localized lesions on the lips and fingers."
