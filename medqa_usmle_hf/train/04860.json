The symptoms suggest myasthenia gravis, which is caused by autoantibodies that block acetylcholine release from nerve terminals. This is further supported by the ptosis of both eyelids and dry oral mucosa, common symptoms in myasthenia gravis. The absence of reflexes suggests a neuromuscular junction disorder rather than a demyelinating disorder, CD8+ T cell infiltration, or vasculitis."

The presence of ptosis of both eyelids, dry oral mucosa, and weakness in all four proximal extremities with absent patellar and biceps reflexes are indicative of myasthenia gravis. The most likely underlying mechanism for this patient\u2019s weakness is autoantibody-impaired acetylcholine release from nerve terminals."

The weakness worsening after inactivity but improving with exercise suggests myasthenia gravis, especially with the notable ptosis of both eyelids and absence of reflexes. The dry oral mucosa may also be a symptom due to involvement of the salivary glands.
