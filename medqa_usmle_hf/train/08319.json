The fact that only one of the five PCR reactions yielded a product could be due to a variety of factors, such as incorrect primers, insufficient template material or PCR conditions that were not optimal. It is important to note that PCR is a highly sensitive and specific technique that can detect even minute amounts of viral DNA or RNA, but it is also prone to false negatives and false positives. Therefore, the results of a PCR experiment should always be interpreted with caution and confirmed by additional tests or sequencing."
