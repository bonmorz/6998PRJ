The symptoms of vaginal bleeding and crampy lower abdominal pain with passage of blood clots suggest a complete abortion, which means that all products of conception have already passed through the vagina. The closed cervical os and absence of a gestational sac on ultrasound also support this diagnosis. Missed abortion would show an empty gestational sac without fetal development, while threatened abortion indicates ongoing bleeding but a viable pregnancy. Incomplete abortion means that only some products of conception have passed through the cervix."

These findings are consistent with a complete abortion, which means that the fetus and all products of conception have been expelled from the uterus. A missed abortion is when the fetus has died but has not yet been expelled, while a threatened abortion is when there is vaginal bleeding but the cervix remains closed and the pregnancy is ongoing. An incomplete abortion is when some but not all of the products of conception have been expelled."
