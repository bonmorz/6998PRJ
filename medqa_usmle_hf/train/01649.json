The treatment should focus on correcting the acidosis and glucose levels, as well as addressing any underlying electrolyte imbalances (such as the high potassium level). The appropriate endpoint of treatment for this patient is achieving a normal anion gap, indicating correction of the acidosis. Clinically asymptomatic, normal glucose, and stable vitals are all important, but achieving a normal anion gap is the most specific and important endpoint for DKA treatment."
