Option D is the most appropriate next step as it respects the religious beliefs of the family but also provides necessary medical treatment to the son. The father, being a conscious adult, can make his own decision about blood transfusions. Option A and C are not necessary at this stage and option B may not be safe considering the extent of the son's injuries."

However, the physician also has a duty to provide the best possible medical care for the son. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to transfuse packed red blood cells to the son, but not to the father. This is in line with the concept of substituted judgment, which allows for the use of blood products in life-threatening situations even when it conflicts with a patient's religious beliefs. Seeking a court order or proceeding to surgery without transfusion are both potential options but may not be the best course of action in this specific case. Consulting the ethics committee for medical treatment of the son is a possible option but would likely take too long in a life-threatening situation."

Option (A) may take a lot of time, and Option (C) may not be feasible in the immediate setting. Therefore, option (D) is the most appropriate next step."
