Hydroxylation is the process of adding a hydroxyl group to collagen, which is important for maintaining the integrity of periodontal tissues. Deficiency in vitamin C results in impaired hydroxylation and collagen synthesis, leading to bleeding gums and tooth loss. Cross-linking and glycosylation are also important processes for collagen formation, but they are not immediately affected by vitamin C deficiency. Translation is the process of protein synthesis and is not directly related to the patient\u2019s symptoms."
