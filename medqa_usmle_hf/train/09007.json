The patient\u2019s symptoms and travel history suggest tuberculosis, which is best diagnosed through culturing sputum samples. Option B is correct as tuberculosis bacteria grow slowly and require selective agar media to be incubated for a prolonged period of time before they can be detected. Staining of gastric washing and urine has low diagnostic yield, and Ziehl-Neelsen staining is less sensitive than the fluorescence microscopy with auramine-rhodamine stain. A positive tuberculin test indicates only latent tuberculosis infection, not active infection."
