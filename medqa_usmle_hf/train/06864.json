However, the most pressing concern is the patient's hypertension and distress. Administering labetalol, a beta-blocker, will help to lower the blood pressure and relieve the patient's symptoms. Heparin therapy and aspirin may be indicated later for the pulmonary embolism, but first, the patient's hypertension and distress must be addressed. Tissue plasminogen activator is contraindicated in the presence of a pulmonary embolism."

The patient's history of hypertension and smoking, along with the symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath, raise suspicion for a possible heart attack. The ECG and CT scan provide additional evidence of cardiovascular disease. Labetalol, a beta blocker, is the most appropriate next step in management to decrease blood pressure and heart rate, stabilize the patient, and reduce the risk of further cardiac events. Heparin therapy, tissue plasminogen activator, and aspirin are other potential treatments for acute coronary syndrome, but they should be used in conjunction with beta blockers and other interventions depending on the specific situation."
