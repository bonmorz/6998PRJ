The patient\u2019s elevated glucose levels despite metformin and lifestyle modifications suggest the need for insulin therapy. Basal-bolus insulin involves the use of long-acting basal insulin and rapid-acting bolus insulin before meals to provide both basal and prandial glucose control. Adding basal insulin to metformin may not provide adequate glucose control for this patient. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors can cause diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with elevated glucose levels, making it a poor choice for this patient. Thiazolidinediones have a delayed onset of action and may not provide rapid glucose control."

The patient\u2019s HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control, which means metformin alone is not sufficient.

Basal-bolus insulin is the optimal therapy for this patient as it provides both basal and prandial insulin coverage, allowing for better glycemic control. Basal insulin added to metformin or the addition of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor may not provide sufficient glycemic control, while thiazolidinediones are associated with weight gain and increased risk of heart failure, making them a less desirable option for this patient."
