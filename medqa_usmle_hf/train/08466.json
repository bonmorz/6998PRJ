The patient has left lower abdominal discomfort, which is worsened after meals, and a history of chronic constipation but no episodes of bloody stools, suggests a possible colon or rectal mass that needs to be ruled out. An abdominal CT is the most appropriate study at this stage to evaluate the colon or rectum. Abdominal ultrasound is used to evaluate the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. Colonoscopy is more invasive and not recommended as the first-line investigation. A barium study is not as sensitive as a CT scan or colonoscopy for detecting polyps or masses."
