The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a mild case of viral upper respiratory tract infection, which commonly leads to bronchitis. Supportive treatment is usually enough for mild cases, and administering antibiotics inappropriately can lead to resistance. Performing Bordetella pertussis PCR or conducting a high-resolution chest CT is not necessary unless the patient\u2019s symptoms worsen or she develops complications."

The absence of fevers, chills, and rales make pneumonia unlikely. The wheezes suggest bronchospasm, which may be treated with bronchodilators or corticosteroids if the symptoms persist. Supportive treatment is the most appropriate course of action at this time. Performing Bordetella pertussis PCR would not be appropriate as the patient\u2019s symptoms are not consistent with whooping cough. Conducting a high-resolution chest CT is unnecessary given the absence of other concerning clinical findings. Administering clarithromycin would not be appropriate as the patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a viral rather than bacterial infection."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a viral respiratory infection, and the presence of wheezes suggests bronchitis or reactive airway disease. Treatment for viral respiratory infections is supportive, and antibiotics are not indicated unless there is evidence of bacterial infection, which is not present here. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is supportive treatment only. Option B is incorrect because there is no suggestion of pertussis in the patient or her son. Option C is excessive because the patient\u2019s symptoms are not severe enough to warrant a high-resolution chest CT. Option D is incorrect because antibiotics are not indicated for viral respiratory infections."

The patient presents with symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection and mild shortness of breath, as well as a productive cough. While the cough could be due to pertussis, the lack of fever and the mild nature of the symptoms make this less likely. A chest CT is not necessary at this point, as the patient only has mild symptoms and there are no signs of a lower respiratory tract infection. Antibiotics are not indicated at this point either, as the patient likely has a viral illness. Therefore, supportive treatment only (option A) is the most appropriate next step in management. This may include rest, fluids, and symptomatic relief with over-the-counter medications."
