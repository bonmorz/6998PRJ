The enzyme in question is glucokinase, which is responsible for the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate in the liver and pancreatic beta cells. In MODY type 2, a genetic defect leads to a reduced activity of glucokinase, resulting in mild hyperglycemia. This hyperglycemia can be exacerbated during pregnancy due to increased insulin resistance. Option (A) describes the correct pathway for the function of glucokinase. Option (B) describes the pathway for the enzymatic action of hexokinase, which is not affected in MODY type 2. Option (C) describes the pathway for the enzymatic action of aldolase, which is not affected in MODY type 2. Option (D) describes the pathway for the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, which is not affected in MODY type 2."
