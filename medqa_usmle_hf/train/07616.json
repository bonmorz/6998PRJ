The tenderness between the tendons of extensor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis indicates de Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis, which can lead to osteoarthritis of the radiocarpal joint as a complication. Paralysis of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle is not associated with this condition. Avascular necrosis of the lunate bone is associated with Kienbock\u2019s disease, which is not related to this condition. Contracture of the palmar aponeurosis is associated with Dupuytren's contracture, which is also not related to this condition."

The tenderness between the tendons of extensor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis suggests De Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis, which is a type of repetitive strain injury. Repetitive strain injuries are associated with osteoarthritis of the joint involved in the injury, in this case, the radiocarpal joint. Therefore, the patient is at increased risk of developing osteoarthritis of the radiocarpal joint. Paralysis of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle is associated with carpal tunnel syndrome. Avascular necrosis of the lunate bone is associated with Kienbock\u2019s disease, which is caused by a disruption of blood supply to the bone. Contracture of the palmar aponeurosis is associated with Dupuytren\u2019s contracture, which is a slowly progressive thickening and shortening of the palmar fascia causing the fingers to flex."
