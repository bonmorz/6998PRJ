The patient was prescribed propranolol and propylthiouracil, indicating her symptoms are likely due to hyperthyroidism. The subsequent laboratory values reveal an increase in TSH, indicating that her thyroid function is normalizing. The best next step in management would be to discontinue current medications as they may no longer be necessary and potentially contributing to the patient\u2019s fatigue. Adding ibuprofen or T3 would not be appropriate given the patient\u2019s current presentation. Decreasing the dose of current medications may also not be necessary if discontinuation is deemed appropriate."
