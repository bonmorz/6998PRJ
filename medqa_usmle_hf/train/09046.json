The 3+ glucose in the urine dipstick test also suggests possible GDM. The triple test, which includes glucose screening, should be highly recommended for this patient to diagnose or rule out GDM. Chorionic villus sampling is not indicated in this scenario as it is typically done to detect genetic disorders. Serum creatinine may be ordered to assess kidney function but is not the most appropriate test for this patient at this time."
