Option A is a prevention measure for Toxoplasmosis, which can also cause congenital abnormalities, but this is not the most likely cause given the travel history.

The use of mosquito repellent during the pregnancy could have helped prevent Zika virus infection. Prenatal vitamins are important for fetal development but would not prevent toxoplasmosis or Zika virus. Discontinuation of the mood stabilizer could lead to risks for both the mother and the fetus."
