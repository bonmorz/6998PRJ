The caramel-like odor of the diapers, along with positive urine studies for ketone bodies, suggests maple syrup urine disease.

Thiamine supplementation can help improve the patient's condition by activating the enzyme transketolase, which can help divert the accumulation of toxic metabolites. Leucine and tyrosine should be avoided in the patient's diet, and tetrahydrobiopterin does not have a known role in maple syrup urine disease."
