The physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Down syndrome, which is most commonly caused by meiotic non-disjunction, where there is an error in the separation of chromosomes during cell division. Uniparental disomy is when an individual has two copies of a chromosome, or part of a chromosome, from one parent and none from the other. Genomic imprinting is a process where one of the parent's genes is silenced, and partial deletion is when a segment of the genetic material is missing. None of these scenarios directly lead to the physical findings described in the question."
