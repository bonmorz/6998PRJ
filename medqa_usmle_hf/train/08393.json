The patient had a history of cervical cancer, and now presents with postmenopausal bleeding and an irregular mass protruding from the vaginal wall, which suggests metastasis of cervical cancer via direct extension to the vagina. Atrophy of vaginal tissues and primary malignancy of vaginal squamous cells are less likely given the patient\u2019s history. Hematogenous spread is less likely because the mass is directly related to the site of the original cancer."

The patient has a past medical history of cervical cancer that was treated with surgical resection and radiation, which puts her at a high risk for metastasis of cervical cancer via direct extension. The irregular mass protruding from the vaginal wall suggests a possible tumor. Atrophy of vaginal tissues is more common in older women but would not cause postcoital bleeding and an irregular mass. Metastasis of cervical cancer via hematogenous spread is less likely because her symptoms suggest local extension. Primary malignancy of vaginal squamous cells is possible but less likely given her history of cervical cancer."
