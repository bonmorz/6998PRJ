Treatment with pharmacotherapy usually involves levothyroxine, which increases T4 and T3 levels. However, in some cases, an increase in reverse T3 (rT3) may occur, which is an inactive form of T3. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."

The appropriate pharmacotherapy for this is typically levothyroxine. However, after several weeks of therapy with levothyroxine, increased levels of reverse T3 (rT3) are expected due to the conversion of T4 to rT3 instead of T3. This is due to the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis resetting and the body's attempt to maintain a balance between T3 and rT3 levels."

The appropriate pharmacotherapy for hypothyroidism is levothyroxine, which can increase the production of reverse T3. This is because levothyroxine can increase the conversion of T4 to both T3 and reverse T3, and the increased production of T3 can lead to feedback inhibition of the conversion of T4 to T3, resulting in increased reverse T3 production."
