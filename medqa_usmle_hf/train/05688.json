This is indicative of a psychotic disorder, and may be associated with a poor prognosis. The fact that he lacks insight into his condition is also suggestive of a psychotic disorder. As such, confrontational psychoeducation would not be beneficial in this case."

Option A is incorrect as the prognosis for schizophrenia varies and is not necessarily better or worse based on specific symptoms."

The fact that he did not comply with other physicians\u2019 treatment and has poor communication with his family also suggests poor functioning. Patients with disorganized thinking have poorer outcomes compared to those with other types of schizophrenia. The answer choices (A) and (B) are not relevant to the description of the patient, and confrontational psychoeducation is not recommended for patients with disorganized thinking."
