The patient\u2019s symptoms including scleral icterus and dark urine staining her diaper, and laboratory results showing elevated direct bilirubin suggest the most likely diagnosis is obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary tree. Increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin would result in elevated indirect bilirubin. Increased production of bilirubin would result in elevated total bilirubin without elevation of direct bilirubin. Obstruction of the intrahepatic biliary tree would not produce the same symptoms and laboratory values. The patient's family history of hepatitis B in the maternal uncle also supports a diagnosis of obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary tree."

The patient has scleral icterus, dark urine staining her diaper, and elevated direct bilirubin levels, suggesting conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The elevated alkaline phosphatase suggests obstruction of the biliary tract. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary tree. Option A is incorrect because increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin would result in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Option B is incorrect because while increased production of bilirubin could cause jaundice, it would generally not result in elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Option D is incorrect because obstruction of the intrahepatic biliary tree would not likely result in scleral icterus or dark urine staining."
