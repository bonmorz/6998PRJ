The patient has a history of painful episodes and a recent trip to Kenya, which suggest possible sickle cell disease or malaria. A hematocrit of 25% and pale conjunctivae suggest anemia, which is common in sickle cell disease. Howell-Jolly bodies are remnants of DNA that are typically removed by a healthy spleen. In sickle cell disease, the spleen is often dysfunctional, leading to increased Howell-Jolly bodies in the peripheral blood smear. The other options are not associated with sickle cell disease or malaria."

Decreased number of thrombocytes is seen in thrombocytopenia, which is not typically associated with sickle cell disease.
