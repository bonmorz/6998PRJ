The patient's presentation is most consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which is characterized by microthrombi formation leading to hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and organ dysfunction. The presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear supports this diagnosis. Bacteremia and infection with an RNA picornavirus are possible causes of the initial abdominal symptoms but do not explain the current presentation. IgA immune complex-mediated vasculitis is unlikely given the absence of purpuric rash and joint involvement."

(A) and (D) are possible causes of bacterial infections, but they do not explain the symptoms and laboratory findings in this patient. (B) is incorrect because IgA immune complex-mediated vasculitis is not characteristic of HUS."
