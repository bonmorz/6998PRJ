The patient\u2019s symptoms, including lower abdominal pain, fevers, and pelvic tenderness, suggest Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), which is commonly caused by sexually transmitted infections. The cervical inflammation and discharge on speculum examination also support this diagnosis. Vaginitis may cause similar symptoms but usually presents with vaginal discharge, itching or burning, and does not typically cause significant abdominal pain. Cervicitis would not explain the abdominal pain and fevers. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy is unlikely given the negative pregnancy test and the fact that the patient is on oral contraception."
