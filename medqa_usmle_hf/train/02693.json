The cream containing a chemotherapeutic agent that is an antimetabolite and an S-phase-specific anticancer drug suggests that the mechanism of action is the inhibition of thymidylate synthase. Thymidylate synthase is an enzyme that plays an essential role in DNA synthesis, and by inhibiting it, the cream prevents cancer cells from replicating and growing. This type of treatment is known as topical chemotherapy."

The cream that is FDA-approved for the treatment of small superficial basal cell carcinomas in low-risk areas is likely to be imiquimod cream, which stimulates the immune system to attack cancer cells. However, the question specifically asks about a cream containing a chemotherapeutic agent that is an antimetabolite, which suggests fluorouracil cream. Fluorouracil inhibits thymidylate synthase, which is necessary for the synthesis of DNA. Inhibition of thymidylate synthase leads to DNA damage and cell death, which can be effective against cancer cells."

The cream contains the drug imiquimod, which works by enhancing the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate cancer cells, as well as by inhibiting the enzyme thymidylate synthase, an essential enzyme needed for DNA synthesis. This inhibition leads to a decrease in tumor cell proliferation and increased cell death. Option (C) is the correct answer. Inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase (option A) and de novo purine nucleotide synthesis (option D) are alternative mechanisms for anticancer drugs that work on DNA synthesis. Option B, inhibition of DNA repair, is not the primary mechanism of imiquimod."

Option (D) is incorrect as it refers to a different enzyme in the process of nucleotide synthesis."
