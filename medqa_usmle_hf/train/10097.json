The patient's symptoms suggest renal artery stenosis, and the presence of a bruit and small right kidney on ultrasound support this diagnosis. Among the options, fibromuscular dysplasia is a known cause of renal artery stenosis, especially in younger patients with no prior history of hypertension. Atherosclerotic plaques are more common in older patients and those with a history of hypertension. Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis that can cause renal artery stenosis, but it is less likely to present with tinnitus and headaches. Congenital renal hypoplasia is not related to the patient's symptoms."

The patient's age, gender, and smoking history are risk factors for fibromuscular dysplasia. The CT angiography showed stenosis of the distal right renal artery, which is a common location for fibromuscular dysplasia. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition is fibromuscular dysplasia. Polyarteritis nodosa and atherosclerotic plaques can also cause renal artery stenosis, but the patient's age and risk factors make fibromuscular dysplasia the more likely cause. Congenital renal hypoplasia is not related to the patient's symptoms."
