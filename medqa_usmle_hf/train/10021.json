The laboratory values indicate mild dehydration and acute kidney injury, but there are no significant electrolyte imbalances that would cause laryngospasm or paresthesias. The normal calcium levels and absence of any ECG changes make QT prolongation unlikely. Therefore, the patient is most likely asymptomatic despite his laboratory abnormalities.
