The symptoms and signs suggest the most likely diagnosis is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can cause lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and cervical motion tenderness. The patient\u2019s sexual history and purulent cervical discharge are also suggestive of PID. Pyelonephritis may cause fever and flank pain, but not cervical motion tenderness or purulent discharge. Ectopic pregnancy usually presents with vaginal bleeding and may have severe abdominal pain, but not cervical motion tenderness or purulent discharge. Appendicitis typically causes right lower quadrant pain and fever, but not cervical motion tenderness or purulent discharge."

The symptoms suggest a pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is often caused by sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia and gonorrhea. The cervical motion tenderness and purulent discharge on pelvic exam are also typical findings. The leukocytosis and elevated ESR are also consistent with an inflammatory process. Pyelonephritis would typically present with fever, flank pain, and urinary symptoms, which are not present here. Ectopic pregnancy would typically have vaginal bleeding and may present with abdominal pain, but the presence of cervical motion tenderness and purulent discharge make PID more likely.
