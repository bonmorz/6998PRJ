Option (B) is less likely as hypotonia, or decreased muscle tone, is not commonly associated with hallucinogen use. Option (C) is also less likely as hallucinogens often decrease sensitivity to pain. Option (D) is unlikely as excessive perspiration is not a common physical exam finding during hallucinogen use."
