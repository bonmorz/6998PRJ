The patient's symptoms are most consistent with carotid hypersensitivity syndrome, which is characterized by syncope or near-syncope during neck movements such as shaving or tying a tie. The fact that the patient experiences these symptoms only in the morning also supports this diagnosis, as baroreflex sensitivity is increased in the morning. All other options are less likely based on the patient's history and physical exam findings."
