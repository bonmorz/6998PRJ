Gardos channel blocking agents prevent RBC dehydration by inhibiting K+ efflux, thereby reducing the frequency of pain crises in sickle cell disease patients. Option B is incorrect because Gardos channel blocking agents do not increase production of hemoglobin F. Option C is incorrect because it refers to dehydration prevention through inhibiting Ca2+ efflux, which is not the mechanism of action of Gardos channel blocking agents. Option D is incorrect because it refers to alkalinization of the blood which is not the intended effect of Gardos channel blocking agents."
