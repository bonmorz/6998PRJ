The patient\u2019s laboratory findings are within normal ranges, except for the prolonged partial thromboplastin time, suggesting a clotting factor deficiency. The most common cause of clotting factor deficiency in children is hemophilia, which typically presents with bleeding into joints or deep tissues (hemarthrosis) rather than systemic bleeding. Purpura fulminans and intracranial hemorrhage are more severe bleeding disorders than what is described in the patient. Epistaxis, or nosebleed, is a common symptom associated with bleeding disorders and is consistent with the patient\u2019s presentation of persistent bleeding following tooth extraction. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Epistaxis."
