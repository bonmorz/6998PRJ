The congenital heart defect described is consistent with a form of tricuspid atresia, with the pulmonary outflow tract obstruction leading to a reversal of blood flow from right to left. This could manifest as bluish discoloration of the lips due to decreased oxygenation. Hepatomegaly could occur due to congestion, but this would likely be a later finding. Diaphoresis while sucking and clubbing of finger nails are not specific to this condition."

The congenital heart defect mentioned in the scenario is known as tricuspid atresia, a condition where blood cannot flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. As a result, blood is shunted from the left atrium to the right atrium and then to the left ventricle, leading to oxygenated blood mixing with deoxygenated blood. This can result in cyanosis, or bluish discoloration of the lips and other areas of the body, as the infant\u2019s body struggles to get enough oxygen. Hepatomegaly and clubbing of the finger nails may develop later as a consequence of the cyanosis, while diaphoresis while sucking may be a sign of heart failure or other complications."
