The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest an autoimmune reaction against retinal antigens, as the redness, pain, and decreased vision can all be symptoms of this condition. The fact that the patient has had surgery on his left eye in the past and uses contact lenses daily may increase the likelihood of autoimmune reaction. The other options do not fit the patient\u2019s symptoms or medical history."

The symptoms and physical examination suggest a condition called uveitis, which is inflammation of the uvea in the eye. Since the patient had surgery on his left eye 6 months ago, there could be an autoimmune reaction against retinal antigens that is causing the uveitis. Reactivation of herpes zoster virus can cause a condition called herpes zoster ophthalmicus, but this usually affects one eye and causes a characteristic rash. Impaired drainage of aqueous humor can cause a condition called glaucoma, but this usually presents with increased eye pressure. Age-related denaturation of lens proteins can cause cataracts, but this does not present with pain, redness, and decreased visual acuity."
