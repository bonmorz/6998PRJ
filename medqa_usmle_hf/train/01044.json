A transmural tear of the lower esophagus or Boerhaave syndrome would present with more severe symptoms and signs of shock. Inflammation of the esophageal wall or esophagitis would not typically cause the patient to vomit blood.

Transmural tear of the lower esophagus (Boerhaave syndrome) is often associated with forceful vomiting and typically presents with chest pain and signs of mediastinitis. Inflammation of the esophageal wall (esophagitis) is a less likely cause in this patient since he has not reported any symptoms consistent with reflux or heartburn. Neoplastic growth at the gastroesophageal junction (esophageal cancer) is unlikely to present acutely with symptoms of vomiting and hematemesis."
