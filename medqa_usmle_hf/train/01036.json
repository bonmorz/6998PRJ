The history of falling on the right outstretched hand may have contributed to this. The other options involve different joints and structures, and are therefore less likely."

The patient\u2019s symptoms include pain in the thumb and radiates to the elbow, which is consistent with De Quervain tenosynovitis. The tenderness over the radial styloid with swelling and pain indicating pathological friction between tendons and their coverings, as well as tenderness with longitudinal traction on the thumb which is the Finkelstein test, supports this diagnosis. Swan neck deformity involves hyperextension of the proximal interphalangeal joint and flexion of the distal interphalangeal joint. Mallet finger presents with forced flexion of the distal phalanx. Carpal tunnel syndrome presents with numbness or tingling in the median nerve distribution in the hand, and the Tinel test is positive."

The symptoms suggest De Quervain tenosynovitis, which is inflammation of the tendons and tendon sheaths on the thumb side of the wrist. This is often caused by repetitive motions involving gripping or pinching, which is consistent with the patient holding her infant son. The tenderness over the radial styloid and pain elicited by longitudinal traction towards the ulnar side are classic signs of De Quervain tenosynovitis. The other options are unlikely given the location of symptoms and lack of other joint involvement."
