The sharp, stabbing pain in the chest upon coughing and inhalation indicates pleurisy. Pleurisy in SLE patients is often accompanied by pericarditis, which can cause a friction rub at the cardiac apex that does not vary with respiration, as noted in the patient. Displaced apical impulse and mid-systolic click are not typically present in pericarditis or pleurisy. Pain improvement with inspiration is typical of pleurisy, but it is not present in all cases. Breakthrough pain that improves with leaning forward, however, is a classic sign of pericarditis."
