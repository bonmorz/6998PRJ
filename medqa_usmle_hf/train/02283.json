The symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory findings suggest acute pyelonephritis secondary to an obstructing ureteral stone. The presence of hydronephrosis on CT scan makes percutaneous nephrostomy necessary for drainage of the affected kidney and intravenous antibiotics necessary to treat the infection. Therefore, the best course of treatment for this patient is to admit to the hospital for percutaneous nephrostomy and IV antibiotics. Discharging home with oral antibiotics is not appropriate for this level of infection, and administering potassium citrate does not address the immediate need to drain the affected kidney."

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a urinary tract infection caused by an obstructing kidney stone. The presence of hydronephrosis indicates that the obstruction is significant. Therefore, the best course of treatment would be to admit the patient to the hospital for percutaneous nephrostomy and IV antibiotics. This will allow for drainage of infected urine and relieve the obstruction caused by the stone. Discharge home with oral antibiotics is not appropriate given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the presence of an obstructing stone. Administering potassium citrate may help prevent the formation of new stones, but it will not treat the current infection or obstruction. Admitting the patient to the hospital for IV antibiotics alone may not be sufficient to relieve the obstruction and prevent complications."
