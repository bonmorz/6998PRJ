The platelet count of the patient is low, which is often found in cirrhosis because of splenomegaly and platelet sequestration. The liver cirrhosis, jaundice, and firm liver also indicate cirrhosis, which can cause portal vein hypertension, leading to increased splenic sequestration of platelets. Bone-marrow-based disorders usually cause pancytopenia, but only the platelet count is low in this patient. Increased platelet clearance is common in thrombocytopenia, but the main cause in this patient is platelet sequestration due to cirrhosis. There is no information to suggest a genetic disorder as a cause of thrombocytopenia in this patient."
