Specifically, the patient leans further to the right when standing on his right leg, suggesting weakness in the right gluteus medius muscle. The superior gluteal nerve supplies the gluteus medius muscle and is therefore the most likely nerve to be damaged. The femoral nerve supplies the quadriceps muscles, the inferior gluteal nerve supplies the gluteus maximus muscle, and the tibial nerve supplies the posterior compartment of the leg."

Damage to the inferior gluteal nerve would result in weakness in hip extension. Damage to the tibial nerve would result in weakness in plantar flexion and inversion of the foot."
