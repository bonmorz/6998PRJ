The girl has a cystic swelling in the midline of the neck that moves upwards on protrusion of the tongue, which is indicative of a thyroglossal duct cyst. Ultrasonography of the neck is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and plan management. Excision of the cyst with track and hyoid bone may be necessary, but a diagnosis with ultrasonography is required first. CT scan of the neck is not the first-line diagnostic test for thyroglossal duct cyst. Excision of the cyst without a confirmed diagnosis may lead to unnecessary surgery."

The description of the cystic, midline swelling that moves upwards on protrusion of the tongue suggests a thyroglossal duct cyst.

Excision of the cyst, track and hyoid bone is not necessary unless the cyst is large or symptomatic. Excision of the cyst alone may not address the underlying thyroglossal duct abnormality, which may lead to recurrence."

Based on the presented case history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is thyroglossal duct cyst. Ultrasonography of the neck is the most appropriate next step in management as it will help to confirm the diagnosis and assess the size, location, and relationship of the cyst to surrounding structures. Excision of the cyst is the definitive treatment, but it should only be performed after confirmation of the diagnosis and proper evaluation of the surrounding structures. Excision of the cyst, track and hyoid bone is an outdated and unnecessary procedure. CT scan of the neck may provide additional information but is not the initial test of choice."

The presentation suggests a thyroglossal duct cyst, which is usually located in the midline of the neck and moves upwards on protrusion of the tongue. Ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step in management to further evaluate the cyst before surgical intervention. Excision of the cyst is the ultimate treatment, but an imaging study should be done first. Option A (excision of the cyst, track, and hyoid bone) is only appropriate in cases of recurrent thyroglossal duct cysts or when cancer is suspected. CT scan of the neck is not necessary for the diagnosis of a thyroglossal duct cyst."
