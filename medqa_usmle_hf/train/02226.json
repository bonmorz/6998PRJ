Long-term management can include discontinuing the ACE inhibitor and starting on an alternative medication, such as an angiotensin receptor blocker or danazol. Option A, fresh frozen plasma, is used for certain coagulation disorders. Option B, ecallantide, is used for hereditary angioedema, which is not the likely cause in this case. Option D, discontinuing metformin, is not necessary as it is not associated with angioedema."
