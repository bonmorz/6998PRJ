The presence of valvular vegetations and a pansystolic murmur in the mitral area also support this diagnosis. Among the options, Streptococcus viridans is most commonly associated with subacute infective endocarditis and valvular vegetations on the mitral valve."

Actinomyces israelii is an anaerobic organism that may cause chronic infections but is not commonly implicated in acute endocarditis. Group B streptococcus is more commonly associated with infections in neonates and pregnant women."

The patient has a history of recent dental work and presents with a fever, fatigue, weight loss, and bleeding spots on the feet, suggesting infective endocarditis. The presence of a pansystolic murmur in the mitral area with radiation to the right axilla and valvular vegetations on the mitral valve with mild regurgitation seen on the echocardiogram confirms the diagnosis. Streptococcus viridans is the most common organism responsible for infective endocarditis associated with dental procedures. Therefore, the likely organism that will grow in the blood cultures is Streptococcus viridans. Empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and vancomycin is appropriate until the results of the blood cultures are available."
