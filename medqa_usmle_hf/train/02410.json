The patient\u2019s symptoms, including sudden onset of weakness and slurred speech, suggest a transient ischemic attack (TIA). The carotid artery stenosis found on CT angiography is a risk factor for future TIAs or strokes. Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure that can help reduce the risk of future TIAs or strokes in patients with carotid artery stenosis. Other options, such as brain MRI or initiation of medications, may be considered for long-term management, but carotid endarterectomy is the most appropriate next step given the patient\u2019s current presentation."
