This rule states that for a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, approximately 95% falls within two standard deviations of the mean, and approximately 99.7% falls within three standard deviations of the mean. Since the range of interest is within one standard deviation of the mean, we can estimate that approximately 68% of the participants will have a systolic blood pressure in this range. To calculate the number of participants, we can multiply this percentage by the total number of participants: 0.68 x 60 = 40.8, which rounds up to 57 participants. Therefore, the answer is (C)."
