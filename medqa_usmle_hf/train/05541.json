Coagulation studies and blood typing/crossmatch should be initiated to identify any coagulopathies and ensure that blood products are readily available if needed. Imaging studies like CT or radiograph may be needed later, but the immediate concern is managing the bleeding and preventing further blood loss. Tourniquet use is generally reserved for severe bleeding that cannot be controlled by direct pressure or other means, and in this case, direct pressure is already controlling the bleeding adequately."
