The patient\u2019s symptoms and history suggest that the most likely diagnosis is primary dysmenorrhea, which is characterized by painful menstrual periods. The absence of adnexal masses or tenderness and cervical motion tenderness rules out ectopic pregnancy and appendicitis. Leiomyoma can cause pelvic pain, but typically presents with a palpable mass on pelvic exam, which is not present in this case."
