The medication mentioned is likely warfarin, an anticoagulant, which works by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Thus, monitoring the patient's prothrombin time (PT) is necessary to adjust the dose of warfarin. Dark-green, leafy vegetables contain high levels of vitamin K, which can interfere with the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. Anti-factor Xa activity is monitored when using heparin as an anticoagulant. Thrombin time (TT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are also tests used to evaluate clotting function but are not as specific to warfarin monitoring as PT."
