The location of the patient\u2019s pain and tenderness, and the fact that he is being prepared for laparoscopic abdominal surgery, suggest that the surgeons will be looking for the source of his pain and fever in the appendix, which is located in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. The teniae coli are longitudinal bands of smooth muscle in the large intestine that converge at the appendix, and can aid the surgeons in locating it during surgery. McBurney's point is a landmark for the appendix, but may not be as reliable in every patient. The transumbilical plane and linea semilunaris are not relevant to the location of the appendix."

Therefore, identifying the teniae coli can aid the surgeons in locating the appendix for removal.
