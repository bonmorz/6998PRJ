The patient's inability to produce pustulant fluid and recruit immune cells in the first few hours of inflammation indicates a defect in the early stages of neutrophil recruitment. The fact that the neutrophils are able to loosely attach to purified vessel tissues but not prefer one side over the other when pathogenic proteins are present suggests a defect in the complement-mediated chemotaxis. Therefore, the mediator involved in this step is C5a. Integrins, ICAM proteins, and selectins are involved in later stages of neutrophil recruitment."

The question describes a defect in the recruitment of immune cells and a specific step involving the movement and attachment of neutrophils to vessel walls. Among the options, C5a is a mediator that is involved in recruiting neutrophils to the site of inflammation and activating them. The fact that the neutrophils in this patient are able to loosely attach to vessel walls but not move towards pathogenic proteins suggests that the issue is in the activation and recruitment of the neutrophils, which is a function of C5a. Integrins and ICAM proteins are involved in the adhesion between cells, but not specifically in the recruitment of neutrophils to inflammation sites. Selectins are involved in the initial rolling and tethering of leukocytes to vessel walls, but not in the firm attachment and subsequent movement across the vessel walls."

The experiment shows that the neutrophils from the patients lose the ability to exhibit a preference between two sides of a purified vessel wall, suggesting a defect in chemotaxis. C5a is a chemotactic factor and its absence can lead to a defect in the first step of neutrophil recruitment.

The lack of recruitment of immune cells and inability to produce pustulant fluid suggests that the neutrophils are not able to move from the blood vessels to the site of inflammation, which is mediated by the process of extravasation that involves selectins, integrins, and ICAM proteins. However, the patient's neutrophils are able to attach loosely and tightly to the vessel walls, indicating that the defect is not within these steps. Instead, the fact that the neutrophils do not exhibit a preference between the two sides suggests that the defect lies within the signaling pathways that respond to chemotactic gradients, which are mediated by C5a. Therefore, the step of neutrophil recruitment that is most likely defective in this patient involves C5a."

The question describes a defect in the early stages of neutrophil recruitment, specifically in the step where the neutrophils loosely attach to vessel tissues before tightly attaching and crossing the vessel wall. This step is mediated by selectins. However, the last part of the question involving pathogenic proteins on two sides of a purified vessel wall suggests that the defect could also involve C5a, which is involved in chemotaxis and guides neutrophils to the site of infection. Based on the information given, the most likely answer is (D) selectins, but (A) C5a could also be a possible answer."

The question describes a defect in the early stages of neutrophil recruitment, specifically their ability to respond to local infections. The process of neutrophil recruitment involves three steps: rolling, activation, and adhesion. Selectins are responsible for the initial rolling step, integrins and ICAM proteins are involved in adhesion, and C5a is an activator of neutrophils. The fact that the neutrophils in this patient are able to attach loosely to vessel tissues but not exhibit a preference in the presence of pathogenic proteins suggests that the defect lies in the activation step, which involves C5a as a key mediator.

The description of the patient's inability to respond to local infections and lack of recruitment of immune cells suggest a problem with neutrophil recruitment. The statement that neutrophils can slow their movement in a flow chamber by loosely attaching to purified vessel tissues indicates that the initial step of rolling is functional, which involves selectins. The subsequent statement that neutrophils attach tightly to vessel walls and move across them indicates that integrins and ICAM proteins are functional. The final statement that neutrophils do not exhibit a preference between two sides of a purified vessel wall implicates a defect in chemotaxis, which is mediated by molecules such as C5a.

The patient's inability to produce pustulant fluid and recruit immune cells in the first several hours of inflammation suggest defective neutrophil recruitment. The process of neutrophil recruitment involves a series of steps, with the first step being rolling adhesion of neutrophils on the endothelial surface of the blood vessel mediated by selectins. The second step involves integrins binding to ICAM proteins, allowing the neutrophils to firmly adhere to the vessel wall and then move across it to the site of inflammation. The final step involves chemotaxis towards the source of the inflammatory stimulus, which is mediated by chemokines such as C5a. Since the patient's neutrophils are able to adhere loosely and firmly to the vessel walls, but are unable to exhibit a preference between two sides when different levels of pathogenic proteins are placed on them, it suggests a defect in the chemotaxis step mediated by C5a.

Integrins, ICAM proteins, and selectins all play important roles in neutrophil adhesion and transmigration, but without a chemoattractant, the neutrophils will not be able to get to the site in the first place."
