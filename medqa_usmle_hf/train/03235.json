The administration of isotonic fluid will affect the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume and osmolality, but not the ICF volume or body osmolality. Isotonic fluid has the same osmolality as the ECF, so it will not change the osmolality of the body. The ICF is protected by the cell membrane, so it will not be affected by the administration of isotonic fluid. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) no change in ICF volume, no change in body osmolality."
