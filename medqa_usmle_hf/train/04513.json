These cysts develop from remnants of the thyroglossal duct which is formed during embryonic development as a connection between the developing thyroid gland and the pharynx. The duct normally degenerates but remnants can persist and form cysts. The thyroglossal duct is derived from the midline endoderm of the pharynx, so the correct answer is (D).
