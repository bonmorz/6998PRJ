Given the patient's history of diffuse exertional chest pain that is successfully treated with sublingual nitroglycerin, it suggests that the chest pain is due to angina, which is caused by insufficient blood supply to the heart. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor that reduces blood pressure and cardiac workload. An improvement in chest pain is likely due to the reduction of end-diastolic pressure, which reduces the workload of the heart and improves blood supply to the heart. A decrease in peripheral arterial resistance or electrical conduction speed, or an increase in venous pooling, would not improve chest pain in this case."
