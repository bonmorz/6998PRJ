The patient had seizure-like activity followed by loss of consciousness after diving and now presents with altered mental status, mottled skin, and shallow breath sounds, which suggest decompression sickness. The next best step in management would be to secure the patient's airway and administer 100% oxygen and rapid transport for recompression in a hyperbaric chamber. Giving phenytoin or starting high volume fluid resuscitation would not address the underlying issue of decompression sickness, while obtaining a noncontrast head CT and administering tPA would not be appropriate in this case."

The mottled appearance of skin and shallow breath sounds are a sign of systemic hypoxia, and the altered mental status is likely due to cerebral embolization. Therefore, the next best step in managing this patient is to secure the airway and administer 100% oxygen while rapidly transporting the patient to a hyperbaric chamber for recompression therapy. Option (A) is not appropriate as phenytoin is an anticonvulsant and not indicated for decompression sickness. Option (B) may be used to stabilize the patient's blood pressure, but it will not address the underlying cause of the symptoms. Option (D) is not appropriate as tPA is used for acute ischemic stroke and can increase bleeding risk in patients with cerebral embolization."
