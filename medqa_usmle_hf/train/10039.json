The patient has symptoms of adrenal crisis, which may be caused by adrenal insufficiency due to long-term use of prednisone. The round face with prominent fat pads suggests Cushing's syndrome. Among the options, decreased corticotropin-releasing hormone is the most likely laboratory change because it is the hormone that regulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn activates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. If the corticotropin-releasing hormone is decreased, then the ACTH is also likely to be decreased, leading to decreased production of cortisol."

Prominent preauricular fat pads and the use of prednisone suggest Cushing's syndrome, which results from increased cortisol levels. However, the patient also presents with hypoglycemia, which is more consistent with Addison's disease caused by adrenal insufficiency. The best answer choice is decreased corticotropin-releasing hormone, which can cause decreased production of cortisol and other adrenal hormones. This can occur as a result of autoimmune destruction of the adrenal gland in conditions such as autoimmune adrenalitis, which can be associated with sarcoidosis."
