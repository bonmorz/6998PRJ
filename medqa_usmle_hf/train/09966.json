Using standard deviation rules, we know that approximately 95% of the population falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean. That means the student scored higher than 95% of the students in the sample. However, since we are looking for the percentage of students that he scored higher than, we subtract this from 100 and get 5%. Therefore, he scored higher than 97.5% of the students. The correct answer is (D)."

Scoring 2 standard deviations over the mean puts the subject at the 97.5th percentile, meaning they scored higher than 97.5% of the students in the study. This is calculated by finding the area under the normal distribution curve between the mean and 2 standard deviations above the mean, which is 0.475. Subtracting this from 1 gives 0.525, or 52.5%. Multiplying this by 2 gives 105%, but since this is not possible, we subtract 2.5% from 100% to get the final answer of 97.5%."

Since the subject scores 2 standard deviations above the mean, we have erf[(2)/(sqrt(2))] + 0.5 = 0.975, which corresponds to the 97.5th percentile.
