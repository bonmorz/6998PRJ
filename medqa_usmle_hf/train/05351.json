Hemiballismus is an involuntary movement disorder characterized by sudden, wild, flailing movements of the limbs on one side of the body, which would be the most likely finding on physical examination in this case. Cogwheel rigidity and dystonia are associated with Parkinson's disease, and vertical gaze palsy is associated with midbrain lesions."
