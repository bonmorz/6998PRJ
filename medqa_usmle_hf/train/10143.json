The photograph of the right eye shows a corneal infiltrate with surrounding edema and a hypopyon, which suggests a bacterial infection. Among the options given, Pseudomonas keratitis is the most likely because it commonly affects contact lens wearers and can quickly lead to corneal destruction. Staphylococcus aureus keratitis can also occur with contact lens use but usually takes longer to develop, and it typically presents with a central ulcer rather than a diffuse infiltrate. Angle-closure glaucoma and herpes zoster keratitis do not cause the same presentation seen in the photograph."

According to EyeWiki from the American Academy of Ophthalmology, \"Pseudomonas keratitis should be suspected in contact lens wearers with red eyes and symptoms of ocular pain, tearing, discharge, and photophobia. In early stages, the cornea shows superficial punctate epithelial erosions, followed by mid-stromal location of the Pseudomonas ulcer, which often manifests as a slough or an abscess with a surrounding dense infiltrate. The characteristic fluorescein staining pattern of a Pseudomonas ulcer with the presence of hypopyon and satellite lesions may be seen. The treatment usually involves combination therapy with topical fortified antibiotics and/or antipseudomonal antibiotics after corneal scraping and culturing.\""
