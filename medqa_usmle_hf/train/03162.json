The mutation in the ADAMTS13 gene results in a deficiency of the metalloprotease responsible for cleavage of vWF, leading to abnormally large vWF multimers. This can result in the formation of platelet clots and thrombi, which can cause the hemolysis of red blood cells and the fragmentation of erythrocytes. Therefore, fragmented erythrocytes (also known as schistocytes) are the most likely laboratory finding in these patients. Elevated haptoglobin levels and urinary red blood cell casts are associated with hemolytic anemias, but are not specific to this particular bleeding disorder. Elevated platelet count may be seen in response to bleeding or thrombotic events, but does not specifically relate to the ADAMTS13 gene mutation."
