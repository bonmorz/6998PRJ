Then, we calculate the probability of not getting a deep venous thrombosis: 1 \u2013 0.00008 = 0.99992. To find the probability of both events not happening, we multiply the two probabilities: 0.96 x 0.99992 = 0.95997312. Finally, we subtract this number from 1 to get the probability of at least one event happening: 1 \u2013 0.95997312 = 0.04002688. Therefore, the risk of developing a deep venous thrombosis following total knee replacement is 0.002, or 0.2%. Note that the assumption of independence between the two events may not be entirely accurate in reality, but is necessary for the purposes of this calculation."
