The patient had signed a living will, indicating her wishes not to receive life support on mechanical ventilation, and there was no indication of a change in her wishes. Therefore, it is important to respect the patient's autonomy and follow her wishes, regardless of the family member's objections. Referring decision-making to an ethics committee or the primary care physician may change the management of the patient, but these options do not address the patient's specific wishes. Hospice care may be appropriate at a later stage, but not in the acute setting of the emergency department. Option (A) is the most appropriate response to the son's wishes, as it respects and follows the patient's advance directives."

The hospital\u2019s ethics committee may be involved if there is a conflict or disagreement between the patient\u2019s wishes and the durable power-of-attorney. Hospice care may be appropriate if the patient is at the end-of-life stage, but this information is not provided in the scenario.
