The presence of bronze hyperpigmentation of the skin and significant hepatomegaly suggests hemochromatosis, a disorder where the body absorbs too much iron from the diet, leading to iron accumulation in the liver, pancreas, and joints. Therefore, option (A) is correct. Hemochromatosis is usually due to a genetic defect and not a hypersensitivity reaction to blood transfusions (option B). Increased ferritin activity can be seen in hemochromatosis, but it is not the cause of excess iron accumulation (option C). The triad of cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and skin pigmentation is characteristic of Wilson's disease, another genetic disorder of copper metabolism, and is not associated with hemochromatosis (option D)."
