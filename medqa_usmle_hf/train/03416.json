The laboratory studies and bone marrow smear suggest that the patient is experiencing hematologic toxicity from the drug, which is most likely isoniazid (INH). INH inhibits mycolic acid synthesis in the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, leading to its bactericidal effect. However, INH can also cause hematologic toxicity, particularly in patients with genetic variations in drug metabolism."
