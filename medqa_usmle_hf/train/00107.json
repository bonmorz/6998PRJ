One of the most common acute complications associated with this syndrome is hypocalcemia-induced neuromuscular irritability, which can result in seizures or tetany. Cerebral edema, hypoglycemia, and shortening of the QT interval are not commonly associated with this syndrome."

Cerebral edema and hypoglycemia are not typically associated with DiGeorge syndrome, and shortening of the QT interval may be seen in some patients but is not a critical acute complication that requires urgent evaluation."

The most likely acute complication would be hypocalcemic tetany or neuromuscular irritability. Cerebral edema and hypoglycemia are not expected acute complications in this case.
