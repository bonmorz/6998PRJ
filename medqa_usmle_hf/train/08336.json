Alcohol withdrawal would typically present with other symptoms such as tremors and anxiety."

The patient\u2019s symptoms of feeling tired during the day, dreamlike state before falling asleep and after waking up, and frequent nighttime awakenings suggest narcolepsy. This is further supported by the absence of snoring and alcohol/drug abuse, as well as a normal BMI and vital signs. Obstructive sleep apnea would typically involve snoring and episodes of apnea, but this is not seen in this patient. Delayed sleep phase syndrome would not explain the dreamlike state or inability to move upon awakening. Alcohol withdrawal is unlikely given the patient\u2019s denial of alcohol use."
