By blocking this interaction, the monoclonal antibody allows for increased T-cell activation and anti-tumor immunity. Option A is incorrect, as MHC class II presents antigens to CD4+ T cells, not CTLA-4. Option B is incorrect, as the T cell receptor interacts with the antigen presented on the MHC molecule. Option C is incorrect, as CD28 is a costimulatory molecule present on the surface of T cells, not antigen-presenting cells."

MHC class II molecules are involved in presenting antigens to CD4+ T-cells, and T-cell receptor (TCR) interacts with the antigen peptide-MHC complex.
