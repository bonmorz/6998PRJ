Histopathologic examination of seborrheic keratosis shows immature keratinocytes with small keratin-filled cysts. S100-positive epithelioid cells with fine granules in the cytoplasm are characteristic of melanoma. Koilocytes in the granular cell layer of the epidermis are seen in HPV infection. Fibroblast proliferation with small, benign dermal growth suggests a dermatofibroma."
