The presentation of respiratory distress in a premature newborn with reduced lung volume and reticulogranular densities on chest x-ray suggests respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is often the first-line treatment for RDS. Corticosteroids may be used in cases of severe RDS, but CPAP is typically tried first. Ampicillin and gentamicin therapy are not indicated for RDS. Surfactant therapy may be used in severe cases of RDS, but CPAP is often tried first."

Ampicillin and gentamicin therapy is used to treat bacterial infections but there is no evidence of infection in this case.

Corticosteroid therapy is used to accelerate lung maturation before birth and is not indicated after delivery. Ampicillin and gentamicin therapy is used to treat infections, but there is no indication of infection in this case.

Surfactant therapy is used for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) when there is a deficiency in surfactant in newborns born before 34 weeks of gestation.
