The committee is investigating the cause of the outbreak and trying to identify weaknesses in the system that led to the outbreak. This is consistent with the approach of root cause analysis, which aims to identify the underlying causes of an adverse event or problem and develop strategies to prevent it from happening in the future. Failure mode and effects analysis (A) and algorithmic analysis (C) are tools used to identify potential failures in a system and develop solutions to prevent them, but they are not specifically focused on investigating adverse events that have already occurred. Heuristic analysis (D) refers to a method of problem-solving that relies on trial and error, rather than a systematic approach like root cause analysis."
