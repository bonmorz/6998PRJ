TSS can occur from prolonged placement of nasal packing and can cause fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash. The macular rash involving palms and soles is also a characteristic feature of TSS. Disseminated gonococcal infection can cause joint pain and skin lesions, but there is no mention of these symptoms in the question stem. Stevens-Johnson syndrome can cause skin lesions, but there is no mention of epidermal detachment. Measles presents with a high fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, but there is no mention of these symptoms in the question stem."

The symptoms and physical exam findings suggest toxic shock syndrome, which can be caused by leaving a nasal pack in for too long. The rash involving the palms and soles is a common finding in toxic shock syndrome. The laboratory studies show leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia, which are also consistent with the diagnosis. Disseminated gonococcal infection and measles do not fit with the patient's history and physical exam. Stevens-Johnson syndrome typically presents with more severe skin involvement and mucosal erosions, which the patient does not have."

The patient presents with symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness, fever, chills, and muscle pain which are all consistent with toxic shock syndrome (TSS). The presence of a diffuse, erythematous, macular rash over the body that involves the palms and the soles and hyperemia with purulent discharge from the underlying mucosa after removal of the anterior nasal pack are also consistent with TSS. The laboratory studies show a total white blood cell count of 30,000/mm3 (30 x 109/L) which is elevated, and a platelet count of 95,000/mm3 (95 x 109/L) which is decreased, both of which can be seen in TSS. Disseminated gonococcal infection can cause arthritis, tenosynovitis, and skin lesions but it doesn't usually cause vomiting and diarrhea. Steven-Johnson syndrome is a severe skin reaction that can be caused by some medications but it wouldn't present with symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. Measles is a viral infection that can cause symptoms such as cough, fever, and a rash but it wouldn't present with hyperemia and purulent discharge from the nasal mucosa."

Laboratory results also show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase, which are consistent with toxic shock syndrome. Disseminated gonococcal infection is unlikely, given the absence of genital symptoms and sexual exposure in the patient's history. Stevens-Johnson syndrome typically exhibits involvement of mucosal surfaces such as the eyes and mouth, whereas the rash in toxic shock syndrome is more diffuse. Measles typically manifests with cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, which are not prominent in this patient."
