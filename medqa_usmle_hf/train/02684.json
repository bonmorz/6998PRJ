Aortic stenosis often causes the murmur to radiate to the carotid arteries bilaterally. The presence of S3 is associated with heart failure, but not specific to aortic stenosis. Murmur radiating to axilla can indicate other conditions such as mitral regurgitation. Asymmetric ventricular hypertrophy is a sign of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is not specific to aortic stenosis."
