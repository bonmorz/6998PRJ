The symptoms and exercise stress test suggest a possible diagnosis of stable angina, which is caused by inadequate blood flow to the heart muscle. During exercise, muscle cells need more energy and breakdown more glycogen. This is carried out by phosphorylase kinase, which activates glycogen phosphorylase to break down glycogen. Therefore, activation of phosphorylase kinase is the most likely explanation for the increased breakdown of glycogen during the exercise stress test. The other options are not related to glycogen metabolism."
