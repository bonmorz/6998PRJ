The patient is likely suffering from a tension pneumothorax, indicated by the decreased SpO2 and distended tender abdomen. The first step in management should be to relieve the pressure using a cricothyroidotomy, as it allows for quick, direct airway access and decompression of tension pneumothorax. Blood transfusion should not be the first step in management, as the patient needs urgent intervention to address the underlying emergency. A FAST scan can be done later, but immediate intervention is necessary. Type and screen for matched blood transfusion is not urgent at this time, and should be done after stabilizing the patient's airway and treating other injuries."
