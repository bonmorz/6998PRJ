The patient's presentation suggests breast cancer, and the significant findings from the biopsy indicate a positive ER/PR and HER-2/neu status. Axillary lymphadenopathy is the most important indicator of a poor prognosis, as it indicates that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and possibly beyond. Increased age, while a risk factor, is not as strong an indicator as lymphadenopathy. ER positivity is actually a good prognostic factor, as it indicates that the cancer is hormone sensitive and can be treated with hormone therapy. HER-2/neu positivity can also be associated with a poor prognosis, but it is not as strong an indicator as lymphadenopathy."
