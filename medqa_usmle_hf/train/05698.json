Cerebral salt wasting and diabetes mellitus do not present with these symptoms and laboratory findings, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus would have low urine osmolality despite water restriction."

The increased thirst and urinary frequency without weight changes or abnormal laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of primary polydipsia. The urine osmolality being higher than serum osmolality following water restriction supports this diagnosis, as it indicates the kidneys are able to concentrate urine normally. Cerebral salt wasting would have low serum sodium, and diabetes mellitus would have high serum glucose. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus would have a low urine osmolality even after water restriction."

The patient's symptoms suggest primary polydipsia, a condition where excessive water drinking leads to dilute urine and low serum sodium levels. This is confirmed by the water restriction test, where urine osmolality becomes concentrated after withholding water. Cerebral salt wasting typically occurs in patients with brain injury or surgery, and would be characterized by hyponatremia. Diabetes mellitus would have elevated blood glucose levels. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus would have dilute urine and low urine osmolality even after water restriction."

The urine's osmolality is low initially but increases significantly after water restriction, indicating the kidneys are responding appropriately to the water deprivation test. Cerebral salt wasting, diabetes mellitus, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus all have different symptoms and laboratory findings."
