Given the presentation of a frontal lobe abscess and paranasal swelling with headache, facial pain, and nasal discharge, the most likely causative agent is fungi, specifically Aspergillus species. Aspergillus is known to cause invasive fungal sinusitis, which can quickly spread to involve the orbital and intracranial structures. Microscopic examination of the infected tissue would show irregular non-septate hyphae, which is characteristic of Aspergillus. Option (A) is characteristic of Blastomyces dermatitidis, (B) is characteristic of Aspergillosis, and (D) is characteristic of Coccidioides immitis."
