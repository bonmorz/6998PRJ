The sudden onset of blindness without any physical findings suggests a functional or psychogenic cause, rather than a structural problem such as retinal detachment. The patient\u2019s stress and anxiety suggest a psychological cause, and the lack of abnormalities on MRI supports this. Malingering is unlikely given the lack of any obvious benefit from the reported symptoms. Somatic symptom disorder is a possibility, but given the sudden onset and lack of other physical symptoms, conversion disorder is the more likely diagnosis."
