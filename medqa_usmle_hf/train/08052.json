The patient has symptoms suggestive of Wallenberg syndrome, which is caused by occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The decreased sensation on the right side of the body and inability to touch nose with eyes closed suggest ipsilateral sensory loss and ataxia, respectively, which are common features of Wallenberg syndrome. The difficulty swallowing and oscillopsia suggest involvement of the vestibular and/or respiratory centers. The other options listed are not consistent with the patient's symptoms."
