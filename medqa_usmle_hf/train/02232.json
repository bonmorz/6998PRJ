The safest position for a thoracentesis is with the patient in the sitting position, below the tip of the scapula midway between the spine and the posterior axillary line on the superior margin of the eighth rib. This position allows for easy access to the pleural space without the risk of damaging adjacent structures like blood vessels or nerves. The other options listed are either not safe for accessing the pleural space or risk damaging adjacent structures."

The safest position is with the patient in a seated position, and the safest point of entry is below the tip of the scapula midway between the spine and the posterior axillary line on the superior margin of the eighth rib. Option A is the correct answer as it describes this safe position and point of entry. Option B is incorrect as it describes an anterior location, which can damage the internal mammary artery. Option C is incorrect as it is too high and can damage the lung apex or subclavian vessels. Option D is incorrect as it is too far anterior and can risk injury to the internal mammary artery or breast tissue."

This location avoids the neurovascular bundle in the lower intercostal spaces and minimizes the risk of pneumothorax. Option B is not correct as it is above the fifth rib, which may risk damaging the lung. Option C is not correct as it is too high for accessing the pleural space properly, and Option D is not correct as the patient should not be in the supine position during the procedure as it may increase the risk of complications such as pneumothorax."
