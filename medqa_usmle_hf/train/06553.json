The medial joint line tenderness, limited range of motion, and medial joint laxity suggest a medial collateral ligament injury. Valgus stress test assesses for medial collateral ligament injury, and this test was positive. Medial meniscus injury would show signs of clicking or giving way and tenderness at the joint line. Anterior cruciate ligament injury would present with effusion, a positive Lachman's test, and a positive pivot shift test. Lateral collateral ligament injury would have tenderness over the lateral tibial plateau and positive varus stress testing."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including tenderness along the medial joint line, suggest a medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury. The patient's hip is slightly flexed and abducted, and the knee is slightly flexed while the patient is in the supine position, which is indicative of MCL injury. Valgus stress test also confirms this diagnosis, as it elicits medial joint laxity, which is suggestive of MCL injury. Anterior cruciate ligament injury typically presents with the feeling of the knee giving way, while lateral collateral ligament injury typically results from varus stress, which is not present in this case. Medial meniscus injury may cause tenderness along the medial joint line, but it typically presents with locking or catching of the knee joint."
