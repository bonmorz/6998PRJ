Based on the patient\u2019s symptoms and examination, the most likely diagnosis is Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), which is often associated with small cell lung cancer. LEMS is an autoimmune disorder, indicated by the use of mouth rinses for dry mouth, and is caused by autoantibodies directed against voltage-gated calcium channels at the neuromuscular junction. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism responsible for this patient\u2019s symptoms is autoimmunity. Metastasis, Invasion, and Inflammation are not the primary mechanisms for LEMS."

The patient\u2019s symptoms and physical examination suggest a neuromuscular disorder, and the CT scan shows a suspicious mass in the right lung.

Metastasis or invasion may cause symptoms related to the affected organ, but are less likely to cause neuromuscular symptoms. Inflammation could be a contributing factor, but autoimmunity is more specific to the patient\u2019s symptoms."
