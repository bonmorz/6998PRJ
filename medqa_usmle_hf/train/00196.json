Assuming the patient's creatinine clearance is at the lower end of normal, and using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, we can estimate the serum creatinine concentration: Creatinine clearance (mL/min) = (140 - age) x weight (kg) / serum creatinine (micromol/L) x 72 (if male), so 92 = (140-62) x weight / serum creatinine x 72, which gives us a serum creatinine value of approximately 1.1 mg/dL."
