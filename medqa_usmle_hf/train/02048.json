The described changes in muscle tissue after denervation suggest apoptosis, which is initiated by the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c. Degradation of Bcl-2-associated X protein is related to the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, but it is not the best explanation for the described biopsy findings. Denaturation of cytoplasmic proteins is a general term that does not specifically explain the observed changes in muscle tissue. Inhibition of Fas/FasL interaction is related to the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis and is not the best explanation for the observed biopsy findings."
