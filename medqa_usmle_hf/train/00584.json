The global pandemic mentioned in the question indicates that the virus is undergoing significant genetic changes that allow it to infect people who have already had the disease or who have no immunity to it. Segmented genomic material is a property required for viral genetic change that can result in global pandemics, as it allows for reassortment of viral genetic material. This is seen in influenza viruses, which have segmented genomic material and can undergo reassortment between different strains, leading to new strains with pandemic potential. Options A, B, and C do not describe the property required for global pandemics in this case."

The property required for genetic change that permits global pandemics is the segmented genomic material, as this allows for reassortment of the genetic material with other strains of the virus, leading to the emergence of new, more virulent strains. Concurrent infection with 2 viruses or crossing over of homologous regions can also lead to genetic changes, but they are not specifically required for global pandemics of this virus. A virus that produces a non-functional protein would not necessarily lead to any genetic changes or global pandemics."
