The symptoms and physical examination findings suggest the patient has Pierre Robin sequence, a condition that may be associated with hypoparathyroidism. The labs show decreased calcium levels, which is consistent with hypoparathyroidism. The hormone that activates 1-alpha-hydroxylase is calcitriol, which is produced by activated vitamin D in the kidneys, and is important for maintaining calcium levels. Therefore, the patient is deficient in calcitriol."

The symptoms, specifically the cleft palate and dysmorphic facial features, suggest a possible diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome (also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome), which can lead to hypoparathyroidism. The hormone that activates 1-alpha-hydroxylase is parathyroid hormone, which is produced by the parathyroid glands and is responsible for regulating calcium and phosphate levels in the body. Hypoparathyroidism can lead to low levels of calcium in the blood, which can have numerous effects on the body including convulsions. Therefore, the hormone this patient is deficient in is parathyroid hormone, which activates 1-alpha-hydroxylase."

The patient has a cleft palate, periorbital fullness, hypoplastic nares, and dysmorphic ears which suggest a diagnosis of Pierre Robin syndrome. This syndrome is commonly associated with a deficiency in calcitriol due to abnormalities in vitamin D metabolism.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A)."
