The patient\u2019s symptoms, laboratory test results, and the presence of polychromasia on the blood smear indicate hemolytic anemia, and the presence of reticulocytes suggests that the bone marrow is trying to compensate for the loss of red blood cells. The low platelet count suggests that the patient is at risk for bleeding. The negative Coombs test indicates that the hemolysis is not caused by an immune response. The correct answer is (A) as eculizumab can be used to treat atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), which is a rare form of hemolytic anemia that can cause red or pink colored urine. The presence of hematuria, abdominal pain, and thrombocytopenia also support a diagnosis of aHUS. Urinary hemosiderin testing is not necessary in this case as the patient\u2019s symptoms and laboratory test results suggest hemolysis as the cause of the red/pink urine. Rituximab therapy is not typically used to treat aHUS."
