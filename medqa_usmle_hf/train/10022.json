The patient is presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis, which is characterized by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia. As the condition is treated, the anion gap should decrease and eventually fall below 10 as a resolution criterion. Other resolution criteria may include a normalization of the serum bicarbonate level, a decrease in blood glucose levels, and an absence of ketones in the urine. Disappearance of serum acetone is not a specific resolution criterion for diabetic ketoacidosis."

Bicarbonate < 10 mEq/L suggests acidosis, increased blood urea nitrogen suggests renal insufficiency, and disappearance of serum acetone suggests elimination of ketones, but these are not resolution criteria for DKA."
