The symptoms, risks factors, and medication history suggest the possibility of renal artery stenosis (RAS), which can result in hypertension and renal dysfunction. The presence of bilateral carotid bruits suggests systemic atherosclerosis, which can include RAS. Unilateral kidney atrophy can be a result of long-standing RAS. Bilateral kidney enlargement, pituitary mass, and diffuse thyroid enlargement are unlikely findings in this case."
