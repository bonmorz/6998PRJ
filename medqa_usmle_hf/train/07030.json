The patient\u2019s weight loss and history of dilation and curettage suggest the possibility of intrauterine adhesions, also known as Asherman syndrome, which can cause amenorrhea. Pregnancy is unlikely due to the negative urine pregnancy test and past history of an unviable pregnancy. Premature menopause is usually associated with other menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness, which the patient did not report. Extreme weight loss can affect menstrual cycles, but intrauterine adhesions are a more likely cause in this case."
