The patient most likely has pyloric stenosis, which is indicated by the palpable mass, visible peristaltic movements, and double channel appearance on barium-contrast studies. The initial step in management should be to correct any electrolyte imbalances, as the patient has been vomiting for the past 3 days and is likely dehydrated. Pyloromyotomy is the definitive treatment for pyloric stenosis but should be performed after fluid and electrolyte correction. Reassurance and observation are not appropriate given the severity of the patient's symptoms. Whipple procedure is not indicated in this case as it is a complex surgical procedure typically used for the treatment of pancreatic tumors."
