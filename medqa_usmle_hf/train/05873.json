The patient presents with severe back pain and tenderness over the thoracic and lumbar spine, along with fever and elevated CRP, which are suggestive of an inflammatory process. Imaging is pending but the history of IV drug abuse puts the patient at increased risk for spinal epidural abscess. Herniated nucleus pulposus and musculoskeletal strain may cause back pain but not with associated fever and elevated CRP. Malingering cannot be definitively diagnosed without further evaluation."
