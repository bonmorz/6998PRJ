The patient presents with fever and fatigue after a hiking trip in Alabama, and the laboratory results reveal leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.

Lyme disease typically presents with a characteristic rash and may have elevated levels of erythema migrans. Rocky Mountain spotted fever typically presents with a rash and fever, but also includes headache, myalgia, and arthralgia. Influenza typically presents with upper respiratory symptoms."
