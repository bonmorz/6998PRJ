The Sabin oral vaccine elicits a higher level of mucosal immunity, including the production of more secretory IgA antibodies in the gut, while the Salk intramuscular vaccine mainly induces a systemic immune response, including the production of more serum IgG antibodies. Therefore, the greatest difference between Patient A and Patient B six weeks after their initial vaccinations would be that Patient A has a higher level of duodenal IgA antibodies."
