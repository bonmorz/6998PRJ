The symptoms suggest hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), which is associated with certain infections and medications such as TMP-SMX. Hemophilia A is inherited as an X-linked recessive disorder, while Marfan syndrome and beta thalassemia are not related to the symptoms experienced by the child. Sickle cell anemia is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder, but it is not associated with the medications or infections mentioned in the case. Therefore, the most likely answer is (C) Hemophilia A, which is also inherited as an X-linked recessive disorder."

Hemophilia A is also an X-linked disorder, while Marfan syndrome and beta thalassemia have different inheritance patterns. Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder."

The symptoms, including fever, dark urine, and jaundice, suggest a possible diagnosis of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or sickle cell crisis. The infant was previously treated for hyperbilirubinemia and the mother was recently treated for UTI with TMP-SMX, which can cause HUS. Hemophilia A is a genetic disorder that affects blood clotting, while Marfan syndrome affects connective tissue and Beta thalassemia affects red blood cell production. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Hemophilia A, which is inherited through an X-linked recessive pattern, similar to the gene linked to G6PD deficiency, which can cause hemolytic anemia like in HUS."
