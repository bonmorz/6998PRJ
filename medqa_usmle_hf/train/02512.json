Crackles, fluffy infiltrates, and thickening of interlobar fissures suggest pulmonary edema, which can be caused by congestive heart failure. Decreased lung compliance is a characteristic feature of pulmonary edema as fluid and inflammation in the lungs make it more difficult for them to expand during inspiration. The other options are not typically seen in congestive heart failure."
