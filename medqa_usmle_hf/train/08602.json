The erythematous, tender nodules on the anterior aspect of both legs and the small draining lesion in the perianal region are indicative of extraintestinal manifestations of IBD. Transmural inflammation is a hallmark of Crohn's disease, and it is likely to be seen on further evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract.

Option B is incorrect because there is likely to be some structural abnormality in the GI tract if the patient has IBD."

The patient's symptoms, weight loss, and skin lesions suggest inflammatory bowel disease, with Crohn's disease being the most likely diagnosis. Crohn's disease often involves transmural inflammation throughout the gastrointestinal tract, leading to strictures and fistulas. Therefore, the most likely finding on further evaluation would be transmural inflammation, making option (D) the correct answer. Villous atrophy would suggest celiac disease, which is not likely based on the patient's symptoms. Melanosis coli is associated with chronic laxative use and not related to the patient's symptoms. No structural abnormalities would be an unlikely finding given the patient's symptoms."
