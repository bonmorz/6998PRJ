The patient presents symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder as well as somatic symptom disorder, which may be related to his persistent concerns about his health and job.

Buspirone and clonazepam are also used for anxiety disorders, but fluoxetine is the best initial step in management. Sumatriptan is used for acute treatment of migraines, but there is no current headache reported by the patient."
