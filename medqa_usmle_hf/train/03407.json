The symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and sudden death in a family member, together with the physical examination findings of a harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur and an early diastolic murmur, suggest hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The Valsalva maneuver causing a louder murmur is a known feature of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Aortic stenosis may also present with a systolic murmur, but the absence of a late-peaking crescendo murmur and the presence of an early diastolic murmur make this option less likely. First-degree heart block and third-degree heart block do not fit this clinical picture."

Aortic stenosis may present with symptoms similar to the patient but the murmur is heard best at the base of the heart, radiates to the neck, and is not affected by the Valsalva maneuver.

HCM is a genetic disease that causes thickening of the heart muscle, leading to restricted blood flow and increased risk of sudden death, which is in line with the patient's brother's sudden death. The murmur heard is consistent with HCM, and the Valsalva maneuver making the murmur louder is a characteristic finding. Aortic stenosis typically presents with a systolic murmur heard best over the right upper sternal border and does not radiate to the axilla. First-degree and third-degree heart block do not typically present with murmurs."

Aortic stenosis typically presents in older patients and would not cause an early diastolic murmur. First- and third-degree heart block are unlikely causes of the patient\u2019s symptoms."
