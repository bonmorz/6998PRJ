The patient\u2019s inability to extend his wrist or fingers suggests injury to the radial nerve, which is responsible for wrist and finger extension. The preserved motor and sensation in the elbow rules out lower trunk and main median nerve injury. The preservation of sensation on most of the volar surface, but not the first dorsal web space, suggests that the injury may be distal to the radial sensory nerve branch. The recurrent motor branch of the median nerve does not control wrist or finger extension."

The patient has preserved motor and sensation in his right elbow but is unable to extend his wrist or fingers, which suggests damage to the radial nerve that innervates these muscles. The preserved sensation on most of the volar surface excludes the main median nerve. The first dorsal web space is innervated by the radial nerve and the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve, but the fact that the patient has preserved sensation on most of the volar surface suggests that the main median nerve is not injured. The lower trunk does not innervate the muscles or sensory areas described in the question."
