The patient's symptoms are consistent with aplastic anemia, which is characterized by pancytopenia and bone marrow hypocellularity in the absence of an abnormal cell population. The patient's smoking history may be a contributing factor, as smoking has been associated with the development of aplastic anemia. Infectious mononucleosis can cause thrombocytopenia, but typically does not cause anemia or leukopenia. Acute lymphocytic leukemia would show abnormal cell population in the bone marrow biopsy. Drug-induced immune pancytopenia is a possibility, but a clear history of medication use is not provided in the question stem."
