Glucose clearance can be calculated using the formula: Clearance = Urine Flow x Urine Glucose Concentration / Serum Glucose Concentration. With absent glucose in the urine and a serum glucose level of 148 mg/dL, the glucose clearance would be 0 mL/min. Sodium and creatinine clearances are calculated similarly, using the formulas: Clearance = Urine Flow x Urine Concentration / Serum Concentration. With a urine flow rate of 1 mL/min, the sodium clearance would be 0.25 mL/min (35 x 1 / 140) and the creatinine clearance would be 100 mL/min (100 x 1 / 1), resulting in answer choice (A)."
