The patient has a significant hypokalemia and elevated BUN and creatinine levels, which suggests possible renal failure.

Option A is incorrect because electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained after correcting the hypokalemia, as ECG changes may worsen with administration of potassium. Option B is incorrect because the patient has significant hypokalemia, so the initial dose of potassium replacement should be given intravenously. Option D can be considered later to evaluate the cause of the hypokalemia, but it is not the immediate next best step in management."
