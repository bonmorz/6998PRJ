Hemoglobin affinity for oxygen is affected by several factors including pH, temperature, and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate concentration. A shift from graph A to B indicates decreased affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, which can be caused by an increase in body temperature. Option A is incorrect since decreased 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate concentration will increase affinity for oxygen. Option B is incorrect since increased pH also increases affinity for oxygen. Option D is incorrect since decreased pCO2 also increases affinity for oxygen."
