The severe periumbilical pain suggests intestinal ischemia, and the vomiting, nausea, and abdominal distention are indications of intestinal obstruction. The patient\u2019s past medical history of ventral hernia repair increases the likelihood of an intestinal obstruction diagnosis. Cholecystitis would cause right upper quadrant pain and tenderness. Diverticulitis would cause left lower quadrant pain and tenderness. Viral gastroenteritis would cause diarrhea and likely lower abdominal pain."
