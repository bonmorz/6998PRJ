The symptoms and laboratory findings suggest hepatic mitochondrial injury, which is caused by overdose of acetaminophen. The patient's mother gave him an analgesic drug, which may have contained acetaminophen. Infection with hepatitis A virus will cause elevated liver enzymes but there is no mention of jaundice. Antifreeze ingestion will cause metabolic acidosis, which is not shown in the arterial blood gas result. Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells will lead to diabetes, which is not suggested by the patient's laboratory findings."

The fact that the patient\u2019s mother gave him an analgesic drug points to the possibility of drug-induced liver injury. The abnormal arterial blood gas analysis suggests metabolic acidosis, which is consistent with hepatic mitochondrial injury. Thus, the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s symptoms is hepatic mitochondrial injury."

Antifreeze ingestion can cause metabolic acidosis, but the patient's acid-base status is not consistent with that diagnosis.

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including fever, headache, sore throat, optic disc swelling, and elevated liver enzymes, are consistent with hepatic mitochondrial injury, which can occur as a result of ingestion of drugs or toxins. The fact that the patient took a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis is consistent with this hypothesis. Hepatitis A virus infection can also cause elevated liver enzymes, but it is less likely given the patient's recent travel to Mexico rather than an area with higher prevalence of hepatitis A. Antifreeze ingestion can cause metabolic acidosis and elevated blood urea nitrogen, but it is not consistent with the patient's other symptoms. Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells is associated with type 1 diabetes, but it is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or laboratory findings."
