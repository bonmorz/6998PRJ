The patient has a history of a fall, normal range of motion, and diffuse tenderness at the L4/L5 region, which suggests mechanical low back pain. Exercise therapy with NSAIDs or acetaminophen is the recommended management for a patient with mechanical low back pain. Bed rest is not recommended for patients with low back pain as it can prolong recovery time. Morphine is not recommended as first-line treatment for low back pain. A radiograph of the lumbar spine is not necessary at this time as the patient does not have any red flag symptoms, such as neurologic deficits, that suggest an urgent need for imaging."

The patient\u2019s history of skiing and fall, along with the presenting symptoms, suggest that the most likely diagnosis is a lumbar strain/sprain or a herniated disc. Rest alone may not help alleviate the symptoms, and morphine is not recommended as a first-line treatment for chronic back pain. Radiograph of the lumbar spine may not show the herniated disc, and MRI may be a better option. Exercise therapy with NSAIDs/acetaminophen is the best option as it can help alleviate pain and improve mobility."

The patient experienced a fall and now presenting with back pain, which suggests that the most likely cause is musculoskeletal injury. Hot packs and Tylenol alleviate the pain somewhat, which supports this hypothesis. Radiograph of the lumbar spine may not capture soft tissue injury and is not likely to be helpful in this case. Best rest may lead to deconditioning and inhibition of functional recovery. Exercise therapy with NSAIDs/acetaminophen would be the best next step in managing this patient's pain and promoting recovery. Morphine as needed may be indicated if pain is severe, but it is not the first-line treatment option."

Resting for a week or taking morphine as needed may not address the underlying issue and may have negative side effects. A radiograph of the lumbar spine may be indicated if there is suspicion of underlying spinal pathology."
