The presence of a capsule is important for the bacteria to cause disease in mice, and a strain that is unable to cause disease in mice may have an altered capsule that would not show up in the Quellung reaction. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. Bile solubility, optochin sensitivity, and hemolytic reaction are all tests used to identify Streptococcus pneumoniae, but they do not necessarily relate to the strain's ability to cause disease in mice."
