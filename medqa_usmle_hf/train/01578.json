The inspiratory wheezing at the left lung base suggests that the tumor might be obstructing some air passages. Since the patient is otherwise healthy except for his hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, the most appropriate next step is to schedule lobectomy, which involves removing the entire lobe of the lung containing the tumor. Radiation therapy and wedge resection are considered for patients with early stage lung cancer, but lobectomy is the preferred treatment for stage II non-small cell lung cancer. Administering cisplatin and etoposide is not considered until further staging workup is completed."
