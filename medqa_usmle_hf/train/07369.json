The fact that liver function tests are normal, but bilirubin levels are elevated, suggests a prehepatic cause of jaundice. Among the options, Rotor syndrome is characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and normal liver function tests, and it is often triggered by illness or stress, which could explain the patient's recent \"stomach flu.\" Cholelithiasis is a posthepatic cause of jaundice, and it would be unlikely to present with normal liver function tests. Crigler-Najjar and Dubin-Johnson syndromes are genetic disorders that would have presented earlier in life, and they are not typically associated with high bilirubin levels."
