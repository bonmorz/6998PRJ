Therefore, the correct answer is (B) IL-4. IFN-gamma is secreted by TH1 cells and is involved in the immune response to viral and bacterial infections. IL-17 is secreted by TH17 cells and plays a role in the immune response to fungal and bacterial infections, as well as in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. TGF-beta is involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, and has a variety of roles in the immune system."
