The diagnosis of brain death is based on clinical criteria and ancillary tests, such as CT scans, cerebral angiography, and/or electroencephalography. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a CT scan. Pulse oximetry, lumbar puncture, and electromyography are not used to confirm brain death."

In order to confirm brain death, the patient must meet certain criteria such as absence of brainstem reflexes, apnea, and cortical activity as assessed by electroencephalogram (EEG) or cerebral blood flow study. However, CT scan can also show the absence of any significant intracranial blood flow, which can confirm brain death and legally remove the patient from the ventilator. Option (A) is incorrect as it does not directly confirm brain death. Options (B) and (C) are also incorrect as they do not provide information regarding brain death."
