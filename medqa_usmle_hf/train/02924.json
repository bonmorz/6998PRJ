The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest an infectious cause, and among the options, Coxsackie virus can cause symptoms of myopericarditis with fatigue, dyspnea, and chest pain on exertion. The jugular venous distention, edema, and S3 sound suggest that the patient has congestive heart failure, which can occur as a complication of Coxsackie virus myopericarditis. Acute rheumatic fever can also cause myopericarditis but would have other symptoms such as joint pain and a history of prior streptococcal infection, which are not mentioned in the question. Borrelia burgdorferi infection can cause Lyme carditis but would not cause a mild cardiac enlargement as seen on chest x-ray. Rhinovirus infection would not cause these specific cardiac symptoms."
