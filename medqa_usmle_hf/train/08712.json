These antibodies are larger and have multiple binding sites, allowing them to efficiently neutralize and clear the pathogen. Later in the infection, smaller dimeric IgG antibodies will be produced, which are more efficient at binding to and neutralizing the pathogen. Therefore, in this case, the antibodies circulating in the student's serum are likely pentamers."
