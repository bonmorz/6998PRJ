The patient is exhibiting symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), characterized by asymmetric septal hypertrophy and sudden loss of consciousness during physical activity. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that helps to decrease the pressure gradient between the aorta and the left ventricle in patients with HCM. High-dose diuretics can worsen the symptoms of HCM. Nitroglycerin is used to treat angina but has no effect on HCM. Forceful attempted exhalation against a closed airway (Valsalva maneuver) can worsen the symptoms of HCM."

The asymmetric septal hypertrophy causes obstruction of blood flow during systole, so decreasing the contractility of the left ventricle with a beta-blocker like metoprolol can decrease the pressure gradient between the aorta and the left ventricle. High-dose diuretics, nitroglycerin, and forceful attempted exhalation against a closed airway are not appropriate treatments for this condition."

The patient most likely has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), as indicated by the asymmetric septal hypertrophy and family history of sudden death. The systolic ejection murmur also supports this. Metoprolol is a beta blocker and is used to decrease heart rate and contractility, which will decrease the pressure gradient between the aorta and the left ventricle in HCM. High-dose diuretics and nitroglycerin are unlikely to have any significant effect on the pressure gradient. Forceful attempted exhalation against a closed airway (Valsalva maneuver) can briefly increase the pressure gradient and is contraindicated in HCM."
