The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest serum sickness, which is caused by immune complex deposition.\n\nQuestion: A 67-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease presents to the emergency department with chest pain that started 2 hours ago. She has been feeling nauseous since the onset of chest pain. Electrocardiogram shows ST-segment depression in leads V4-V6 and II, III, and aVF. Cardiac enzymes are elevated. What is the next best step in management?\n(A) Admit the patient to the hospital for observation (B) Administer fibrinolytics (C) Immediately perform coronary angiography (D) Repeat troponin levels in 12 hours\nAnswer: (C)\nExplanation: We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. The patient\u2019s electrocardiogram shows ST-segment depression and cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating an acute myocardial infarction. Immediate coronary angiography is needed to determine the extent and location of the occluded coronary artery to determine the need for further intervention such as percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery."
