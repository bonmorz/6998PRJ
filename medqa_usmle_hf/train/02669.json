The patient has weakness on one side of his body, specifically the left leg, indicating a contralateral motor pathway impairment which is characteristic of a stroke. The risk factors, such as hypertension, smoking history, and diabetes, are also common risk factors for stroke. The cingulate gyrus is supplied by the anterior cerebral artery, which can be affected in a stroke leading to motor weakness of the contralateral leg. The other options are not supplied by the anterior cerebral artery and do not cause contralateral motor weakness."
