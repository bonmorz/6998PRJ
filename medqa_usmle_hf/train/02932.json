The high CVP, low urine output, and abdominal distension suggests intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). The total urine output over the past 6 hours is significantly low, which can indicate oliguria from renal failure or decreased renal perfusion. The high BUN and creatinine are also signs of acute kidney injury. Reopening the abdomen can help relieve IAH while administration of intravenous antibiotics, angiographic embolization, and hemicolonic resection are not appropriate for the patient\u2019s condition."
