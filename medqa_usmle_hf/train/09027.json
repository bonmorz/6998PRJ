The symptoms suggest that ingestion of Phencyclidine (PCP) most likely explains the patient\u2019s symptoms, as it can cause impaired cognition, agitation, and violent behavior. Miosis and nystagmus are common with PCP use. Heroin and LSD typically do not cause violent behavior, and methamphetamine usually causes hyperactivity rather than cognitive impairment."
