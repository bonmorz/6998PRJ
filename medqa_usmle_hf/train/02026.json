The table shows a clear dose-response relationship between the number of episodes of DKA in the past 3 years and the risk of 30-day readmission for DKA. This supports a causal relationship between the two factors, as the more episodes a patient experiences, the higher their risk of readmission. Confidence intervals, study design, and odds ratio alone do not necessarily indicate a causal relationship."
