However, excessive stimulation of beta-2 receptors can lead to decreased intracellular potassium via the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, which can result in hypokalemia. Therefore, this patient is at increased risk for hypokalemia as a potential adverse effect of treatment with high-dose continuous inhaled albuterol. Miosis is not an adverse effect of albuterol. Hypoglycemia is a potential adverse effect of insulin, but not albuterol. Urinary frequency is not typically associated with use of albuterol."
