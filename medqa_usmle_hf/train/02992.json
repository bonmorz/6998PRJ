The presence of left lower back pain, left flank pain, and brown urine suggests a renal origin for the lesion, and the CT scan image shows a mass in the left kidney. Among the options, only proximal tubule cells are located in the kidney and can form tumors called renal cell carcinomas. Therefore, the most likely cell type for this lesion is proximal tubule cells."

The most common type of kidney cancer in adults is renal cell carcinoma, which arises from the proximal tubule cells. Therefore, the correct answer is (A). Risk factors for renal cell carcinoma include smoking, hypertension, and obesity, which are all present in this patient\u2019s medical history. The brown urine may indicate hematuria or the presence of blood in the urine, which can be a sign of kidney cancer. The patient\u2019s fever, tachycardia, and left costovertebral angle tenderness suggest that the cancer may have spread to the surrounding tissues, including the adrenal glands and lymph nodes. Further imaging and diagnostic tests, such as a biopsy, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and stage the cancer. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, depending on the location and extent of the cancer."
