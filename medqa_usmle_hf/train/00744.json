Option (C) is the correct answer as it indicates low TSH levels (due to negative feedback from high free T4 and free T3 levels) and high free T4 and free T3 levels, indicating hyperthyroidism. Option (A) indicates high TSH levels along with high free T4 and free T3 levels, which would suggest primary hyperthyroidism, but the patient has a diffused goiter, which would suggest Graves' disease, making option (C) more likely."
