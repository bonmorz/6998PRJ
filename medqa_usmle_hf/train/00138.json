Venous duplex ultrasound confirms non-compressibility, which is indicative of DVT. Impaired venous blood flow is therefore the mechanism behind this patient\u2019s illness. Impaired lymphatic blood flow can result in lymphedema, which typically presents with pitting edema and is not associated with erythema or dilated superficial veins. Subcutaneous soft-tissue infection and infection of dermis and subcutaneous tissues are also possible causes of leg swelling but would present with warmth and tenderness, and may have associated fever, which is not seen in this patient\u2019s case."
