However, selecting the appropriate antibiotic requires knowledge of the organism responsible for the infection, which can be determined by obtaining a bone biopsy of the affected area. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to obtain a bone biopsy of the right femur to help determine the appropriate antibiotic therapy. Option A (Nafcillin therapy) could be started empirically while waiting for biopsy results, but it alone would not be sufficient as it does not cover all common pathogens that cause osteomyelitis. Nuclear scan (Option B) could be used to identify areas of increased bone turnover, but MRI has already shown the osteomyelitis. Arthrocentesis (Option C) may be useful in the evaluation of septic arthritis but has no role in the diagnosis or management of osteomyelitis."
