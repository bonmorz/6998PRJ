The patient has a history of erectile dysfunction and is currently taking a medication for it, vardenafil, which increases cyclic GMP. The sudden decrease in blood pressure after nitroglycerin administration suggests a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, which may occur due to the vasodilatory effects of cyclic GMP. Therefore, the most likely mechanism of this patient's hypotension is cyclic GMP elevation."
