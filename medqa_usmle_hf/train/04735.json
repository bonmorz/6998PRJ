Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that targets only the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, which is involved in inflammation and pain, but not the COX-1 enzyme, which is involved in protecting the gastric mucosa. This makes celecoxib less likely to cause gastrointestinal ulcers than other NSAIDs like aspirin, ketorolac, indomethacin, and naproxen."
