The ptosis and high-arched palate are characteristic physical findings, and the muscle weakness and percussion of the thenar eminence are also indicative of Myotonic dystrophy. Spinal muscular atrophy would have different physical findings, such as fasciculation, hypotonia, and respiratory distress. McArdle disease would manifest with exercise intolerance and myalgia, and Juvenile dermatomyositis would have more specific skin manifestations."

The symptoms of easily getting distracted, falling asleep during class, and complaining of leg pain suggest that the most likely diagnosis is Myotonic dystrophy. The presence of ptosis and a high-arched palate are also characteristic of this disease. Spinal muscular atrophy usually presents earlier in life and with more severe muscle weakness. McArdle disease is characterized by muscle cramps and fatigue during exercise. Juvenile dermatomyositis presents with skin rash and muscle weakness involving the proximal muscles. The percussion of the thenar eminence causing slow relaxation of the thumb is a characteristic finding in myotonic dystrophy."
