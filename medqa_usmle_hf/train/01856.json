In emergency situations where the patient is not conscious and unable to give consent, the physician should act in the best interest of the patient and make decisions that preserve life and prevent harm. Amputating the child's arm at the elbow joint is necessary to prevent greater harm and loss of life. Waiting for the child or babysitter to regain consciousness or waiting for the babysitter's consent would cause delays that could lead to further harm. Obtaining a court order may take too long and also cause unnecessary harm and delay. Therefore, the most appropriate course of action is to amputate the child's arm at the elbow joint to prevent further harm and loss of life."
