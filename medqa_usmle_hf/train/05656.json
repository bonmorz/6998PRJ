The patient has been experiencing \u201cfeeling down\u201d since his girlfriend broke up with him 4 years ago, indicating persistent depressive disorder. The symptoms have been present for at least two years, thus fulfilling the criteria for diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder. Major depressive disorder would require the presence of several additional symptoms, such as appetite or sleep disturbance, which are absent in this case. Cyclothymic disorder involves periods of both hypomania and depression, and the patient does not report any symptoms of hypomania. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood would be a possibility if the onset of symptoms had occurred within three months of the breakup."
