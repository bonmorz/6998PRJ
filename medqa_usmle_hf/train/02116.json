The symptoms suggest exposure to organophosphate pesticides, which inhibits acetylcholinesterase, leading to excessive acetylcholine accumulation. The combination of atropine and pralidoxime is used to reverse the effects of organophosphate poisoning. Atropine alone may not be sufficient, and naloxone is used for opioid poisoning, which is not suggested in this case. Lamotrigine is used for seizures, but the cause of the seizure in this case is likely due to organophosphate poisoning."
