The presence of gram-positive, spore-forming bacilli suggests the potential for the bacterium to produce alpha toxin, which is commonly produced by Clostridium perfringens. The Nagler's test is commonly used to identify the presence of alpha toxin, so the presence of the antitoxin preventing phospholipid hydrolysis on one half of the plate suggests that the antitoxin was targeting the alpha toxin produced by the bacteria. The other toxins listed (tetanus, exotoxin A, and diphtheria) are not produced by C. perfringens and would not be relevant in this context."
