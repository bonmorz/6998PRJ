The presence of a fluctuant erythematous lesion suggests the development of a bacterial infection, possibly cellulitis. The primary mechanism for the development of edema in this case is the separation of endothelial junctions due to the release of inflammatory mediators and bacterial toxins, allowing for fluid to leak into the surrounding tissues. Options A and C are not commonly associated with the development of edema in an infected area, and option B is not likely in the absence of other medical conditions that would affect plasma oncotic pressure."

Among the options, separation of endothelial junctions is the most likely cause. When there is an injury or infection in a tissue, histamine is released and causes vasodilation and increased permeability of capillaries, resulting in edema. Separation of endothelial junctions allows fluid and proteins to flow out of blood vessels and into the tissues, causing edema. Fluid production by bacteria is a possible secondary mechanism, but not the primary cause of edema. Decreased plasma oncotic pressure and systemic cytokine release are not likely to cause edema in this context."
