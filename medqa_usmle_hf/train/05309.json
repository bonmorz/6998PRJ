The formula is 4 ml x %TBSA burned x body weight (kg). In this case, the patient\u2019s TBSA burned is not given. However, based on the patient\u2019s presentation, we can assume that it is >20%. Using the Parkland formula with a TBSA of 20% and a body weight of 55 kg, the fluid requirement for the first 24 hours is calculated to be 4 ml x 20% x 55 kg = 4400 ml. Half of this amount should be given in the first 8 hours (2200 ml) and the remaining half should be given over the next 16 hours (2200 ml). Therefore, the most appropriate fluid regimen would be to administer 6 liters (6000 ml) of intravenous crystalloids over the next 24 hours to meet the patient's fluid requirement. Option B, C, and D are not consistent with the Parkland formula."

The formula recommends giving 4 mL of crystalloid solution (e.g. lactated Ringer's solution) per kilogram of body weight per percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) burned. The patient's TBSA burned is not given in the question, but assuming it is around 20%, the fluid requirement would be: 4 mL x 55 kg x 20% = 4,400 mL (or 4.4 liters) in the first 24 hours. Therefore, the most appropriate fluid regimen for this patient would be to administer 6 liters of intravenous crystalloids (e.g. lactated Ringer's solution) over the next 24 hours (\\~2 liters in the first 8 hours and \\~4 liters in the next 16 hours). Option (B) suggests administering intravenous colloids, which are not recommended for fluid resuscitation in burn patients. Option (C) suggests administering 8 liters of intravenous colloids over the next 12 hours, which would be excessive and could increase the risk of complications such as pulmonary edema. Option (D) suggests administering 5 liters of intravenous colloids over the next 6 hours, which would not be sufficient for the patient's fluid requirements."

The formula is 4 mL \u00d7 body weight in kilograms \u00d7 percentage of body surface area burned. The patient's percentage of body surface area burned is not given in the question, but based on the severity of the burns described, we can estimate it to be around 20-30%. Using the lower end of this range (20%) and the patient's weight of 55 kg, the total fluid needed in the first 24 hours would be 4 mL \u00d7 55 \u00d7 20 = 4400 mL, or 4.4 liters. Half of this amount should be administered in the first 8 hours, which would be 2.2 liters, and the remaining 2.2 liters should be administered over the next 16 hours. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is (A), to administer 6 liters of intravenous crystalloids over the next 24 hours. Administering colloids instead of crystalloids is not recommended as crystalloids are the preferred choice for fluid resuscitation in burn patients, and the amount and time frame specified in options (B) and (C) are not based on the Parkland formula. Option (D) specifies a lower amount of fluid than what is recommended by the formula."

The most appropriate fluid regimen for this patient according to the Parkland formula is to administer 6 liters of intravenous crystalloids over the next 24 hours. The Parkland formula calculates fluid requirements for the first 24 hours after burns using the following formula: 4 mL \u00d7 body weight in kg \u00d7 %TBSA burned (total body surface area burned). Half of this total volume should be administered within the first 8 hours after the burn.
