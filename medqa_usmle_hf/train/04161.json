The image shows multiple seborrheic keratoses, which are benign skin lesions that commonly appear in middle-aged or older individuals. They do not grow rapidly or indicate malignancy, and are not associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease. While more lesions may develop over time, they do not require close follow-up unless they become symptomatic or suspicious for malignancy. Therefore, the correct answer choice is (C)."

While any skin lesion should be monitored for changes that could indicate malignancy, seborrheic keratoses are generally harmless. Therefore, (C) is the correct answer."

Angiomas may increase in number over time, but they are typically benign and do not pose a significant risk for malignancy. Option A is incorrect as angiomas do not typically grow rapidly. Option B is incorrect as von Hippel-Lindau disease is associated with hemangioblastomas, not angiomas. Option D is not entirely accurate as angiomas do not typically pose a significant risk for malignancy, but they should be monitored for any changes."
