The most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy would be to add a lipid-lowering medication. Ezetimibe can lower LDL-C and has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with high baseline LDL-C. Fenofibrate can lower triglycerides and raise HDL-C but has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular events. Niacin can raise HDL-C but has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular events. No additional pharmacotherapy at this time is not appropriate given the patient's dyslipidemia and increased CVD risk."

Fenofibrate is used to lower triglyceride levels and increase HDL-C levels, which are not major concerns for this patient. Niacin can increase HDL-C levels, but has limited benefits in reducing CVD risk. No additional pharmacotherapy at this time is not recommended since the patient's dyslipidemia is not well controlled according to guidelines."
