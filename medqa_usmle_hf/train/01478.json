The high blood sugar level, undetectable C-peptide, and negative serum beta-hydroxybutyrate suggest a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. The best initial therapy for this patient is basal-bolus insulin, which involves a long-acting insulin to provide a steady baseline insulin level and rapid-acting insulin to cover meals and high blood sugar levels. Intravenous fluids, insulin infusion, and correction of electrolytes will also be necessary but insulin therapy is the best initial therapy. Metformin and glimepiride are not indicated for type 1 diabetes."
