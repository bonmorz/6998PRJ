The patient has a history of HIV and the MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions are consistent with Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is caused by the JC virus in immunocompromised patients. The positive Toxoplasma gondii IgG result suggests the patient has had exposure to Toxoplasma but the MRI findings are not consistent with cerebral toxoplasmosis. Primary CNS lymphoma typically presents with enhancing lesions on MRI. Vascular dementia typically presents with changes in cognition and memory instead of motor function."

Vascular dementia would be unlikely in a patient of this age and with no significant vascular risk factors. Primary CNS lymphoma and cerebral toxoplasmosis may present with similar symptoms, but the absence of mass effect on imaging makes these less likely."

The symptoms of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, multiple falls, forgetfulness, difficulties operating simple appliances, and becoming more paranoid suggest a neurological condition. The neurological examination showing right lower extremity weakness and disseminated non-enhancing white matter lesions on the MRI of the brain suggest progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which is a viral infection commonly seen in patients with HIV. The positive Toxoplasma gondii IgG may indicate reactivation of previous exposure but is not related to the current symptoms. Vascular dementia and primary CNS lymphoma do not adequately explain the given symptoms and laboratory studies."
