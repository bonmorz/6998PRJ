The sudden onset of diffuse, dull, and throbbing headache with blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, and hypertension suggests hypertensive emergency. The fundoscopic examination shows bilateral blurring of the optic disc margins, which is a specific diagnostic finding in hypertensive emergency. The absence of focal neurologic deficits suggests that it is not an ischemic stroke, while the absence of a thunderclap headache and a negative CT scan of the head rules out subarachnoid hemorrhage. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension typically presents with a chronic headache, not a sudden onset."
