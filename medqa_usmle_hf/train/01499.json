Repeat PSA testing may be considered in the future, but reassurance and comfort care should be prioritized at this time."

The rock hard nodules found on DRE are concerning for malignancy, but a biopsy may pose more risks than benefits. Additionally, PSA levels can vary and are not always indicative of prostate cancer, so repeating the test alone may not provide much useful information. Therefore, reassurance and continued monitoring may be the most appropriate next step in management."

Given the patient's multiple comorbidities and poorly managed medications, aggressive management may not be appropriate for this patient. The nontender prostate with several rock hard nodules on DRE raises suspicion for prostate cancer, but given the patient's age and comorbidities, the benefits of aggressive management may not outweigh the risks. Reassurance may be a reasonable approach, but close follow-up and repeat PSA testing may also be warranted to monitor for any changes. A repeat PSA test in a few months may be appropriate, but the decision should be made based on the patient's overall clinical picture and goals of care."
