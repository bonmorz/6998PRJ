The patient has a history of alcohol intoxication and a finger prick test shows a blood glucose level of 20 mg/dL, indicating that the most likely cause of his unconsciousness is hypoglycemia. Chronic alcoholism can result in macrocytosis, which is an enlargement of red blood cells with an MCV greater than 100fL. Hypersegmented neutrophils and Howell-Jolly bodies suggest bone marrow dysfunction and sickle cells indicate a genetic disorder affecting red blood cells, which are not relevant to this patient's presentation."
