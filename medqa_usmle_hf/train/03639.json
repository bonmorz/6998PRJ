Redistribution is the process by which an anesthetic agent moves from the highly perfused brain to other parts of the body with lower vascularity, leading to a decrease in its concentration in the brain and ultimately the emergence from anesthesia. Thiopental is a short-acting barbiturate that exhibits redistribution as its primary mechanism of recovery from anesthesia. First-pass metabolism refers to the metabolism of a drug in the liver before it reaches the systemic circulation, while zero-order elimination refers to a constant rate of elimination of a drug independent of its concentration. Ion trapping refers to the phenomenon where a drug accumulates on one side of a membrane due to its pKa and pH differences across the membrane."
