It is often associated with hospital-acquired infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections. Methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis can be treated with a combination of intravenous nafcillin and rifampin for 6 weeks, along with gentamicin for the first 2 weeks. This is the most appropriate next step in management. Option A is incorrect as penicillin V is not effective against S. epidermidis and gentamicin is often used in combination with other antibiotics. Option B is incorrect as ceftriaxone is not effective against S. epidermidis. Option C is incorrect as amoxicillin is not effective against S. epidermidis and a 6-week course is recommended for this type of infection."
