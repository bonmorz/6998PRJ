The presence of a wide fixed split in the second heart sound, a medium-pitched systolic ejection murmur and a short mid-diastolic rumble over the lower left sternal border suggests the possibility of ASD with the development of pulmonary hypertension. On an echocardiogram, anterior movement of the ventricular septum during systole is the most typical finding seen in ASD."

The best answer choice is anterior movement of the ventricular septum during systole, which is a characteristic finding in ASD seen on echocardiogram. Decreased right ventricular end-diastolic dimension and goose-neck deformity of left ventricular outflow tract are not typically seen in ASD. Increased left ventricular shortening fraction may be seen in cases of aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which are not suggested by the patient's history or physical exam."

The wide fixed split in the second heart sound and the systolic ejection murmur suggests that the patient may have an atrial septal defect (ASD). The short mid-diastolic rumble is also audible over the lower left sternal border, which is best heard with the bell of the stethoscope suggests that the ASD is associated with an increased flow across the tricuspid valve, causing an increase in right ventricular volume overload. Anterior movement of the ventricular septum during systole is a characteristic feature seen on echocardiography in patients with ASD. Therefore, this option is the correct answer. Decreased right ventricular end-diastolic dimension is seen in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy, and goose-neck deformity of left ventricular outflow tract is seen in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Increased left ventricular shortening fraction is seen in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy."

The wide fixed split in the second heart sound and medium-pitched systolic ejection murmur suggest that the patient has an atrial septal defect (ASD).

Increased left ventricular shortening fraction is more likely to be seen in conditions where the left ventricle has to compensate for increased workload or volume overload, neither of which are present in this case."
