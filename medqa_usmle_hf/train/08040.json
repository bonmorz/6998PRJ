The question asks about a reason to avoid morphine in this patient, so we need to consider contraindications of morphine. Biliary tract dysfunction, especially in the form of biliary colic or cholecystitis, is a contraindication for morphine due to its potential to exacerbate sphincter of Oddi spasm, leading to worsening pain or worsening biliary obstruction. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."
