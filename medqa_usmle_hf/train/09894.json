Bees are associated with allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, but not with the type of rash described. Sun exposure is associated with sunburn and certain skin cancers, but not with the type of rash described. Gluten is associated with celiac disease, which is a systemic autoimmune disorder that affects the gut and other organs, but not with skin rash. Thus, avoidance of contact with plants is the most likely preventive measure for this patient's symptoms."
