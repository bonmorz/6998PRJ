The best screening test for cholera is the string test, which involves passing a string through a stool sample and then testing the string for the presence of the bacteria. Mononuclear spot test is used to diagnose Infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus. Tzanck smear is used to diagnose herpes simplex, varicella-zoster, and other viral infections. Catalase test is used to differentiate bacteria based on their ability to produce catalase enzyme."
