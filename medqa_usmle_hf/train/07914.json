The patient\u2019s symptoms and physical examination suggest primary amenorrhea, which can be caused by a variety of factors such as genetic abnormalities, hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, or structural abnormalities like an imperforate hymen. To determine the cause, FSH and estrogen levels would be most useful as they can indicate if the patient has ovarian failure or if there is a problem with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Pelvic exam would not be useful in this case as the patient has not started menstruating and her physical exam does not suggest any structural abnormalities. Prolactin level and GnRH level may be useful in certain cases, but in this case, FSH and estrogen levels are more appropriate initial tests."
