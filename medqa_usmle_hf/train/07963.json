The patient is experiencing lack of breast milk secretion and amenorrhea, which suggests a disorder in lactation and ovulation. Obstetric hemorrhage can lead to a decrease in the number of oxytocin receptors as well as a decrease in prolactin levels, both of which are necessary for proper lactation. Prolactinoma and increased anterior pituitary perfusion would result in an increase in prolactin levels, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Primary empty sella syndrome is a benign condition of the pituitary gland that is not typically associated with lactation or menstruation."

Increased anterior pituitary perfusion is not a known cause of postpartum hypopituitarism."

The patient's symptoms suggest that she may have Sheehan syndrome, which is caused by severe blood loss during childbirth leading to pituitary gland damage.

Therefore, the most likely contributing factor to this patient's presentation is obstetric hemorrhage."
