The symptoms, elevated levels of neutral amino acids, and the previous history suggest a diagnosis of Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD). The acute treatment of MSUD includes IV glucose and the administration of nicotinic acid to reduce the levels of the branched-chain amino acids. Therefore, the most appropriate acute treatment for this patient is Nicotinic acid. Phenylbutyrate is used as a maintenance treatment for MSUD, pyridoxine is not indicated in the acute treatment of MSUD, and tryptophan is a branched-chain amino acid that should be avoided in the treatment of MSUD."
