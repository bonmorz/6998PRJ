The presentation suggests a genetic disorder, likely X-linked recessive since the patient's brothers are affected and not her father (who would have a 50% chance of being affected with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern). The fact that the patient's husband's family has no history of this disease is not relevant, as the inheritance pattern is X-linked. Therefore, the chances that the patient's children (regardless of gender) will be affected are 50% for each child."

The patient has bilateral loss of central vision and degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells, which suggests a genetic disorder called Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). LCA is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means that both parents must have a copy of the mutated gene for a child to be affected. The chances of having an affected child when both parents are carriers of an autosomal recessive gene is 25%. Since the patient's husband has no family history of the disease, it is assumed that he is not a carrier. Therefore, the chances of the patient's daughter and son being affected are 0% and 50%, respectively. However, if the patient's husband is found to be a carrier after genetic testing, the chances of the daughter and son being affected would be 25% and 50%, respectively. Ignoring the effects of incomplete penetrance is appropriate in this question as it is explicitly stated in the prompt."

The description of the patient\u2019s symptoms suggests a diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited disorder that can cause degeneration of retinal cells. Since both of her brothers have the disease, it is likely that they inherited it from their parents. Assuming that both of the patient\u2019s parents are carriers of the gene mutation that causes retinitis pigmentosa, there is a 25% chance that any given child of theirs will inherit two copies of the mutation and therefore be affected by the disease. Since the patient\u2019s husband\u2019s family has no history of the disease, we can assume that he does not carry the mutation. Therefore, if the patient\u2019s children inherit one copy of the mutation from her, they will be carriers but not affected by the disease. If they inherit two copies of the mutation, they will be affected by the disease. Therefore, both the daughter and the son have a 50% chance of inheriting two copies of the mutation, and therefore a 100% chance of being affected by the disease if they do inherit it."

The presence of two affected brothers and bilateral retinal ganglion cell degeneration suggests that the patient has X-linked recessive inheritance, specifically Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). Since the patient is female, she is a carrier of the LHON mutation, meaning she has one normal X chromosome and one mutated X chromosome. If she has a son, there is a 50% chance that he will inherit the mutated X chromosome and be affected, and if she has a daughter, there is a 50% chance that she will be a carrier like her mother. However, if the son inherits the mutated X chromosome, he will be affected with the disease since there is no corresponding normal X chromosome to compensate for the mutation. Therefore, the answer is (D) Daughter: 100% and son: 100%."

Since both of her older brothers have had visual loss with a similar presentation, it is likely that both of her parents were carriers of the affected gene. Therefore, the chances that her children will be affected by this disease are 100% for both a son and a daughter if her partner is also a carrier of the affected gene."
