The boy has a history of repeated episodes of ear symptoms and a decreased mobility of the tympanic membrane, suggesting that he has chronic otitis media with effusion. Myringotomy with insertion of a tympanostomy tube is the most appropriate intervention for further management, as it can help drain the fluid and equalize the pressure in the middle ear. Antibiotic prophylaxis and adenoidectomy are not the first-line treatment for this condition. Subtherapeutic dose of sulfonamide is not recommended in children under 6 years of age, especially those with recurrent infections."
