The patient's symptoms, specifically the ptosis of the right eye and deviation down and out, suggest impairment of the oculomotor nerve, which innervates the muscles that lift the eyelid and control eye movement. Trochlear nerve innervates the superior oblique muscle, Abducens nerve innervates the lateral rectus muscle, and Facial nerve innervates facial muscles and taste sensation on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. None of these nerves are directly related to the symptoms described."

The symptoms of the patient indicate a problem with the oculomotor nerve, which controls the majority of eye movements and also controls the pupil size. The ptosis and deviation of the right eye down and out suggest a problem with this nerve. Trochlear nerve controls the superior oblique muscles which move the eye down and out, but it's unlikely to be affected in this case. Abducens nerve controls the lateral rectus muscle, which moves the eye laterally, and facial nerve controls facial expressions, and neither are likely to be responsible for the symptoms."

This nerve innervates the levator and superior rectus muscles, which lift the eyelid and move the eye upward, respectively. The down and out deviation of the right eye suggests weakness of the lateral rectus muscle, which is innervated by the abducens nerve. However, because the patient has ptosis, which is caused by the levator muscle, and because the abducens nerve does not innervate this muscle, oculomotor nerve impairment is more likely. The trochlear nerve innervates the superior oblique muscle, which depresses and rotates the eye. The facial nerve innervates the muscles of facial expression and taste sensation in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue."
