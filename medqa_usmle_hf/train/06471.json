JIA can lead to inflammation in almost any joint in the body, including those in the eyes, which can result in uveitis and blindness as a complication. Airway obstruction is not typically associated with JIA. Inflammation of sacroiliac joints is more commonly seen in ankylosing spondylitis. Coronary artery aneurysm is a complication of Kawasaki disease, which typically presents with fever, rash, and conjunctivitis."
