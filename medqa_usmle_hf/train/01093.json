Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo presents with brief, intense episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position; vertebrobasilar stroke presents with sudden onset neurologic symptoms such as weakness and loss of coordination; vestibular neuritis presents with sudden onset vertigo, nausea, and vomiting."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a peripheral vestibular disorder, and among the options, only labyrinthitis matches with the symptoms of hearing loss, nystagmus and sustained sensation of imbalance. Vertebrobasilar stroke would have more severe symptoms, and the patient\u2019s symptoms did not worsen with positional changes, which suggests that benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is not the correct diagnosis.

Vestibular neuritis may also have similar symptoms but typically does not have hearing loss. BPPV can also cause similar symptoms, but the absence of provocation of symptoms with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver makes it less likely."

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can cause dizziness, but the lack of positional provocation and the presence of other symptoms make it less likely. Vertebrobasilar stroke is a serious condition that presents with more severe symptoms, such as loss of consciousness or motor deficits. Finally, vestibular neuritis typically presents with acute onset of vertigo, which is not present in this case."
