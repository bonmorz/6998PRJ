The symptoms of bilious projectile vomiting and distended upper abdomen suggest obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The fact that there are multiple gas collections in the upper abdomen makes duodenal atresia less likely and the absence of gas in the distal abdomen excludes Hirschsprung disease. Meconium ileus is associated with cystic fibrosis, which is not mentioned in the question stem.
