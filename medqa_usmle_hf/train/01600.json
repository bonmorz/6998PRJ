The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a neuromuscular disorder, with progressive leg weakness, large calf muscles, and difficulty with physical activities.

Acetylcholine receptor antibody levels and nerve conduction studies are more useful in diagnosing myasthenia gravis and neuropathies, respectively.
