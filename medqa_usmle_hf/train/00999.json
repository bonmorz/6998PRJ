Anorexia nervosa is associated with low weight (as indicated by the low BMI), constipation, and fine body hair. Patients with anorexia nervosa are also at risk of electrolyte imbalances due to malnutrition, with hypokalemia being one of the common findings in lab tests. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) hypokalemia."
