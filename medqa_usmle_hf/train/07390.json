Alpha toxin is produced by Clostridium species and is not associated with TSS. Endotoxin is a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and is not produced by Staphylococcus aureus. Pyogenic exotoxin A is produced by group A Streptococcus and can cause toxic shock-like syndrome but is not associated with Staphylococcus aureus infection."
