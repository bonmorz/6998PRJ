With a partial placenta previa and loss of retroplacental space, this patient is at risk for placenta accreta or percreta, which can lead to hemorrhage and require emergency hysterectomy. Therefore, cesarean hysterectomy should be considered for the management of this patient. Scheduled cesarean at 37 weeks may also be an option but does not address the risk of placenta accreta. Option (B) is not recommended due to the risk of hemorrhage and option (C) is not necessary as fetal lung maturity is not relevant to the management of placenta previa."

The patient has a partial placenta previa and a loss of the retroplacental space, which puts her at risk for hemorrhage during delivery. If a vaginal delivery is attempted, the obstetrician should be prepared to switch to a cesarean delivery if bleeding occurs. However, given her two previous cesarean deliveries and the risk of hemorrhage, a scheduled cesarean in the lower uterine segment should be considered. Option D is not a common management approach and would only be considered in rare cases where there is severe bleeding and the patient's life is in danger. Option C is not necessary as ultrasound can provide information on fetal lung maturity without the need for amniocentesis. Therefore, option A is the best answer for this question."

The patient has a partial placenta previa and a loss of retroplacental space, indicating the potential for placenta accreta or increta.

Option (A) is incorrect as there is a risk of bleeding, and a scheduled cesarean delivery may not be safe. Option (B) is also incorrect since the risk of severe bleeding is high with vaginal delivery. Option (C) may not be necessary as it does not change the management plan."
