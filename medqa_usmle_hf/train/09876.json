The symptoms of mental retardation, microcephaly, and mousy odor to breath are consistent with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare metabolic disorder caused by a deficit of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity. PKU results in the buildup of phenylalanine and its byproducts in the blood and can lead to neurological problems if left untreated. Option B is incorrect because tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency is associated with a different disease, called dopa-responsive dystonia. Option C is incorrect because excess tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor is associated with a different metabolic disorder, called hyperphenylalaninemia. Option D is incorrect because excess phenylalanine hydroxylase activity is unlikely to cause the symptoms described."
