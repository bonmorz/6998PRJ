The patient's symptoms suggest congestive heart failure, and the physical examination reveals a mid-diastolic rumbling murmur best heard at the apical region, jugular vein distention, and bilateral pitting edema in the lower extremities. Among the options, only (B) describes an infectious agent that causes hemolysis, which is not relevant to the patient's condition. Therefore, the correct answer cannot be (A), (C), or (D). Infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus viridans is a common cause of a mid-diastolic murmur and can lead to heart failure. Streptococcus viridans is known to induce complete lysis of the red cells of a blood agar plate with an oxygen-sensitive cytotoxin, making (B) the correct answer."
