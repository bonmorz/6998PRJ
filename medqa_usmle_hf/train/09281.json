The patient\u2019s history suggests that her symptoms could be caused by Mallory-Weiss tear, which is a linear laceration at the gastroesophageal junction due to forceful retching or vomiting. However, the presence of crepitus over the left lower lung suggests pneumothorax, which can occur as a result of esophageal rupture leading to the escape of air from the mediastinum. Therefore, the most likely etiology is rupture of the esophagus due to increased intraluminal pressure. Horizontal partition in the tunica media of the aorta refers to aortic dissection, which is unlikely to cause crepitus over the lung. Helicobacter pylori infection refers to a bacterial infection that can cause gastric ulcers but is not related to the patient\u2019s current symptoms."
