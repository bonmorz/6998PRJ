The most effective treatment for celiac disease is avoiding certain types of cereal grains that contain gluten, such as wheat, barley, and rye, as indicated in option (B). Treatment with ceftriaxone is not appropriate as there is no indication of bacterial infection. Reduced intake of milk proteins would be indicated if the patient had lactose intolerance, but there is no indication of this in the presented information. Supplemention of pancreatic enzymes is used to treat pancreatic insufficiency, which is not indicated in this case."
