Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus would appear as a mass on the barium swallow study, which is not present. Gastroesophageal reflux disease can cause similar symptoms but would not cause the dilation seen in the barium swallow. Pharyngoesophageal diverticulum is a possible cause but less likely given the other clinical findings."
