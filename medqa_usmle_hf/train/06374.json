The patient\u2019s inability to recall his past and his lack of identification suggests dissociative fugue disorder, which is typically triggered by a traumatic event such as a deployment in Afghanistan. Bipolar I disorder is characterized by manic and depressive episodes. Depersonalization disorder is a dissociative disorder, but it is characterized by feelings of detachment from the self and surroundings, not amnesia. Dissociative identity disorder is characterized by the presence of multiple distinct personality states."

The patient\u2019s inability to recall his own name or past medical history, and his possession of a bus ticket from Chicago to St. Louis suggests that he has dissociative fugue disorder, which is a type of dissociative amnesia characterized by sudden, unexpected travel away from home or one\u2019s customary place of work, with inability to recall one\u2019s past and confusion about personal identity or assumption of a new identity. The lack of manic or depressive symptoms precludes bipolar I disorder. Depersonalization disorder involves a persistent or recurrent feeling of detachment from one\u2019s own mental processes or body. Dissociative identity disorder involves the presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states."

The fact that the patient recently returned from a deployment in Afghanistan may help explain the stress that triggered the disorder. Bipolar disorder, depersonalization disorder, and dissociative identity disorder are not consistent with the patient's symptoms."

The fact that he is a soldier who recently returned from deployment in Afghanistan may have contributed to his dissociative state. Bipolar I disorder is characterized by episodes of mania and depression, while depersonalization disorder is characterized by a persistent feeling of detachment from oneself. Dissociative identity disorder (formerly known as multiple personality disorder) involves the presence of at least two distinct personalities, rather than a loss of identity."
