The description of the patient's wounds suggest that healing by secondary intention will occur, which involves the deposition of large amounts of granulation tissue. Option A is incorrect as granuloma formation is not normally a part of the healing process. Option C is incorrect as abscess formation is a complication of healing and does not describe the healing process itself. Option D is incorrect as healing by primary intention occurs when the wound edges are approximated and there is minimal tissue loss, which is not the case in this scenario."

Option A is incorrect because abundant lymphocytes accumulate in the healing process of chronic inflammation. Option C is incorrect because the healing process involves abscess formation only in cases of certain bacterial infections. Option D is incorrect because healing by primary intention occurs when wound edges are apposed without tissue loss, and the patient has lacerations on his right arm."

Since the lacerations were managed properly and began to heal with proper dressing and occasional debridement, the healing process in this patient is likely to involve healing by secondary intention, which is characterized by the deposition of large amounts of granulation tissue. Option A is incorrect because lymphocytes are not the primary cells involved in the formation of granulation tissue. Option C is incorrect because the healing process should not involve abscess formation. Option D is incorrect because primary intention healing typically involves minimal granulation tissue formation."

Option D is incorrect because healing by primary intention occurs when wound edges are approximated and can be sutured or glued together, whereas this patient's wounds are healing by secondary intention."

Granulation tissue is formed during the healing process, which contains fibroblasts, capillaries, and immune cells but not lymphocytes specific to granuloma formation. Abscess formation is not a typical part of the healing process and would indicate infection. Healing by primary intention occurs when wounds are closed with sutures, and granulation tissue formation is minimal."

The scenario described suggests a healing process by secondary intention, where there is an open wound that is left to heal naturally through a deposition of granulation tissue. This process involves angiogenesis and fibroblast proliferation leading to collagen deposition and maturation, which results in scar formation. Option A is incorrect because a granuloma is a distinct type of chronic inflammation, not part of the normal healing process. Option C is incorrect because abscess formation indicates infection and requires drainage. Option D is incorrect because healing by primary intention occurs when the edges of a surgical incision are sutured together, preventing the formation of granulation tissue."
