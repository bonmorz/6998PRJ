Fluorescein is not capable of inducing an immune response by itself, but it can bind to a larger molecule (such as albumin) and stimulate an immune response. Therefore, it is classified as a hapten. A hapten is a small molecule that can bind to a larger molecule to become immunogenic. Carrier and adjuvant are substances that enhance the immune response, while immunogen is a molecule capable of inducing an immune response on its own."

Fluorescein is a hapten because it can bind to receptors on certain B cells, but it does not stimulate them to produce fluorescein-specific antibodies unless it is first attached to a larger molecule such as albumin. Therefore, the best term to describe fluorescein is hapten."
