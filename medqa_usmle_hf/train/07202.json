The linear pattern of the rash suggests an allergic reaction to an external factor, likely a plant that the patient came into contact with on the camping trip. Preformed IgE antibodies are responsible for immediate hypersensitivity reactions like anaphylaxis, but a linear rash is not characteristic of this type of reaction. Immune complex formation is associated with diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, which would not present with a linear rash. IgG antibodies against hemidesmosomes are associated with pemphigoid diseases, which typically present with blisters rather than papules and vesicles. Presensitized T cells are involved in delayed hypersensitivity reactions and can cause a linear rash like the one seen in this patient."
