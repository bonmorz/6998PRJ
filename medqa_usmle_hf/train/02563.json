The solid, firm, and nontender mass in the right testis that is not reduced when the patient is in a supine position is highly indicative of a testicular tumor. Orchitis is usually painful, while hydrocele testis and scrotal hernia are typically non-solid and reducible. The patient's history of inconsistent condom use and immigration from Argentina raises the possibility of a sexually transmitted infection, which can lead to testicular cancer. The lack of transillumination with a light also supports the diagnosis of a testicular tumor. Further testing, such as an ultrasound or biopsy, should be done to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the mass."

The patient presents with painless scrotal swelling and a solid, firm, nontender mass in the right testis, which are characteristic of a testicular tumor. Orchitis is painful inflammation of the testicles, while hydrocele testis is a painless swelling due to fluid accumulation around the testicle. Scrotal hernia is also a possibility, but the lack of reduction when the patient is in a supine position makes testicular tumor more likely. The patient's history of smoking and inconsistent condom use also increases his risk for testicular cancer. Further testing, such as a scrotal ultrasound and tumor markers, should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis."
