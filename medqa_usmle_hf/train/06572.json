Alcohol consumption may act as a confounding variable, as it is associated with both smoking and the development of esophageal cancer. By accounting for alcohol usage, the confounding effect is removed, and the association between smoking and esophageal cancer is no longer significant. Options A and B are one-sided and do not fully explain the change in result, while Option D is incorrect as adjustments for confounding factors are common in epidemiological research."

The re-analysis of the data found no association between smoking and esophageal cancer after accounting for the confounding effects of alcohol usage, suggesting that alcohol usage is a confounding variable. Option C is the correct answer because it correctly identifies that alcohol usage is a confounding variable that affects both smoking and the likelihood of developing esophageal cancer. Therefore, accounting for alcohol usage can change the association between smoking and esophageal cancer. Option A and B don't explain why the original study found an association between smoking and esophageal cancer but the re-analysis did not. Option D is incorrect because the change in results is possible when accounting for confounding variables."

The letter to the editor suggests that accounting for the confounding effects of alcohol negated the association between smoking and esophageal cancer, which indicates that alcohol may be a confounding variable. Option C explains that men who drink are more likely to smoke and more likely to develop esophageal cancer, thus accounting for the confounding effects of alcohol. This is both necessary and sufficient to explain the change in result."

The re-analysis found no association between smoking and esophageal cancer after accounting for the confounding effects of alcohol usage, suggesting that alcohol consumption is a confounding variable. Option C is the only one that acknowledges this relationship between alcohol consumption, smoking, and esophageal cancer. Men who drink are more likely to smoke, and both smoking and alcohol consumption are risk factors for esophageal cancer. Therefore an association between smoking and esophageal cancer may disappear when alcohol consumption is accounted for. Options A and B only address one factor and do not account for the confounding effect of the other. Option D is incorrect as the change in result is possible when confounding variables are accounted for."

Option A is not sufficient because it does not explain why the initial association disappeared after adjusting for alcohol intake. Option B is not necessary because the re-analysis took smoking into account, but found no association once alcohol was factored in. Option D is incorrect as the change in result was possible with the inclusion of a confounding variable."
