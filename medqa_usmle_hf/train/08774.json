A child can either receive a dominant achondroplasia gene from one parent or no achondroplasia gene from either parent. The probability of having a viable offspring with achondroplasia is 50%, while the probability of having a viable offspring without achondroplasia is 25%. Therefore, there is a 75% chance of having a viable offspring."

Given that both parents have achondroplasia and their first son also has it, we know that the disorder is autosomal dominant. Since their daughter is phenotypically normal, she must be heterozygous for the dominant allele. The fact that they had one unaffected child and one with achondroplasia indicates that there is a 50% chance of having an affected child with each pregnancy. Since this would have been their third child and they have already had one unaffected child, there is a 75% chance of having a viable offspring.

The fact that they had one unaffected child and one affected child suggests that there is a 50% chance of having an affected child with each pregnancy. However, the fact that the parents had an IUFD suggests that there may be some increased risk or potential for complicating factors, so there is not a clear 50/50 chance for viable offspring. Therefore, the best interpretation is that there is a 75% chance of having a viable offspring, taking into account the parents' known history and the possibility of complications. Option A is incorrect because compound heterozygosity implies inheritance of two different mutated genes, which is not the case here. Option B is incorrect because half of their children, not one half, are expected to be unaffected. Option C is incorrect because achondroplasia is a completely dominant disorder, not likely dominant."

The pedigree shows that both the husband and wife are homozygous for achondroplasia (aa), as they both have the disorder and passed it on to their son.

Since the disorder is autosomal dominant, there is a 50% chance of passing the mutated allele on to each offspring. Therefore, the chance of having a viable offspring with or without the disorder is 75%. Option (A) is incorrect because both parents are homozygous for the same allele, not compound heterozygotes. Option (B) is incorrect because their daughter is already proven to be unaffected. Option (C) is incorrect because the disorder has been shown to be dominant, but not necessarily completely dominant."

Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that a person only needs to inherit one copy of the abnormal gene to develop the disorder. In this pedigree, both parents have achondroplasia, which means that they each have at least one copy of the abnormal gene. Their 1st son also has achondroplasia, which confirms that the condition is dominant. Their daughter, however, does not have achondroplasia, which means that she received two normal copies of the gene. The fact that this couple has already had one child with achondroplasia and one child without means that there is a 75% chance of having a viable offspring with achondroplasia and a 25% chance of having a child without the disorder. Option A is incorrect because there is no indication that the parents are compound heterozygotes. Option B is incorrect because not all children are unaffected. Option C is partially correct in that the disorder is dominant, but the word \"completely\" is not necessary and may confuse the interpretation."
