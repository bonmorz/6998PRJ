The large unilateral lesion above the left tonsil is likely the abscess. A serious complication of this diagnosis is Lemierre syndrome, which is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by septicemia from a bacterial infection of the head and neck. It usually starts with a sore throat and spreads to the jugular veins, leading to sepsis and septic shock. Proper monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent the development of this complication."

The large, unilateral lesion points towards a peritonsillar abscess, which is a serious complication that can lead to Lemierre syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by septicemia, thrombophlebitis of the jugular vein, and multiple metastatic infections.

The symptoms, including difficulty swallowing, sore throat, lymphadenopathy and high fever, suggest the most likely diagnosis is tonsillitis, specifically quinsy. A complication of quinsy can be Lemierre's syndrome, which is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition involving a deep neck infection and sepsis. Infectious mononucleosis can also cause similar symptoms, but the presence of a unilateral lesion is more indicative of quinsy. Whooping cough and diphtheria are unlikely causes in this patient."

Infectious mononucleosis can also cause sore throat and swollen lymph nodes, but does not usually lead to a peritonsillar abscess.

Lemierre syndrome is a rare but serious complication of bacterial pharyngitis, where an infection in the throat spreads to the blood vessels, causing septicemia and clots in the jugular vein. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Infectious mononucleosis can cause sore throat and cervical lymphadenopathy, but it is not associated with a peritonsillar abscess. Whooping cough and diphtheria both present with sore throat and fever, but they are not associated with a peritonsillar abscess."

Infectious mononucleosis can cause sore throat and difficulty swallowing, but it is not associated with the formation of abscesses. Whooping cough is caused by Bordetella pertussis and is associated with a severe cough, not sore throat and difficulty swallowing. Diphtheria is a bacterial infection that can cause a gray or white patch in the throat, not a unilateral lesion superior to the tonsil."
