With Aspergillus fumigatus infection, the most likely immunodeficiency is a defect in the NAPDH oxidase, which affects the ability of phagocytic cells to generate reactive oxygen species to destroy the fungus. LFA-1 integrin defect is associated with leukocyte adhesion deficiency, lysosomal trafficking regulator gene defect is associated with Ch\u00e9diak\u2013Higashi syndrome, and WASP gene mutation is associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome."

The patient\u2019s medical history and laboratory findings suggest a primary immunodeficiency, specifically chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which is caused by a defect in NADPH oxidase.

Aspergillus fumigatus is a common fungus that causes infections in patients with CGD. Options A and B refer to defects that lead to leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 and Chediak-Higashi syndrome, respectively, which present with recurrent bacterial infections. Option D refers to Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which presents with recurrent bacterial and viral infections, and immunodeficiency with allergy and autoimmune manifestations."
