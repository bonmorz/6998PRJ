Since the patient was stabilized on fluoxetine and denies taking any medications that could poison her brain, it is likely that she was prescribed fluoxetine. A potential adverse outcome of fluoxetine when taken during pregnancy is atrialization of the right ventricle in the fetus. Tardive dyskinesia and Stevens-Johnson syndrome are potential adverse outcomes of antipsychotic medications, not antidepressants. Weight loss is a common side effect of fluoxetine, but it is not a potential adverse outcome."
