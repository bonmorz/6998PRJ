The patient\u2019s history of working in a glass manufacturing factory for 15 years suggests an occupational exposure to silica, which can cause silicosis. The x-ray findings of calcification of hilar lymph nodes and scattered nodules support the diagnosis. Silicosis puts patients at risk for developing pulmonary tuberculosis as a complication. Malignant mesothelioma is caused by asbestos exposure and would not be expected in this patient. Invasive aspergillosis and Pneumocystis pneumonia may occur in immunocompromised patients, but there is no indication of immunocompromise in this case."
