The patient has been diagnosed with asthma and is currently using a short-acting \u03b22-agonist as needed, which is appropriate for mild intermittent asthma. Inhalatory corticosteroids are indicated for persistent asthma, and long-acting \u03b22-agonists are mainly used as an adjunct therapy for moderate to severe persistent asthma. Using a short-acting \u03b22-agonist every day, regardless of symptoms, is not recommended and may lead to overuse and potential adverse effects. Therefore, the most appropriate option is to continue with the current treatment plan of using the short-acting \u03b22-agonist as needed for acute exacerbations. However, the patient should be monitored closely for changes in asthma control and the need for adjustments in treatment."
