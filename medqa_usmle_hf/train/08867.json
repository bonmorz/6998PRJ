The patient\u2019s history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chemotherapy suggests that his immune system may be compromised, increasing the likelihood of reactivation of Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which causes shingles. The location of the painful vesicles in the left C7 dermatome is consistent with shingles. Therefore, the most likely etiology of the skin lesions is reactivation of VZV due to immunodeficiency caused by chemotherapy."

Option B, chickenpox, would present with diffuse skin lesions and is unlikely given the patient\u2019s age and previous history of chickenpox infection.
