The introduction of virions from different phenotypes into a host cell and the subsequent production of progeny viruses with distinct phenotypes suggests that recombination has occurred, where genetic material from both parent strains has been exchanged. Complementation refers to the phenomenon where a virus with a defect in one gene can be rescued by another virus with a functional copy of that gene. Phenotypic mixing refers to a phenomenon where a host cell is co-infected with two different viruses and progeny viruses contain the surface proteins of one virus and the genetic material of another.

The progeny viruses having distinct phenotypes that are a result of the combination of material from both parent strains best fits the definition of recombination. Complementation occurs when two different mutants infect the same cell and restore the wild-type phenotype. Phenotypic mixing occurs when two different viruses infect a cell, but the progeny viruses have the same phenotype as the parent virus that provided the structural proteins. Transduction is a process in which foreign genetic material is introduced into a bacterial cell by a virus. None of these terms fit the given scenario."

The phenomenon described here is called recombination, which occurs when the genetic material from two different viruses mix to form a hybrid virus with unique characteristics. Complementation occurs when two viruses with defective genomes can combine to form a functioning virus, phenotypic mixing occurs when a host cell is infected by two distinct viruses and progeny virions contain genetic material from both viruses, and transduction involves the transfer of genetic material from one bacterium to another by a virus.

Recombination is the process where two different strains of virus exchange genetic material, resulting in progeny viruses that have genomes with material from both parent strains. Complementation refers to the process where two different viruses with non-functional gene products complement each other to produce a functional product. Phenotypic mixing refers to the situation where intact virions of one virus (not just genetic material) infect a cell that is then co-infected by a second virus, resulting in progeny virions with the outer coat of the first virus and the genetic material of the second virus. Transduction refers to the process where a virus transfers genetic material from one bacterium to another bacterium. In this case, the most appropriate term to describe the observed findings is recombination, as the progeny viruses have genomes with material from both parent strains."
