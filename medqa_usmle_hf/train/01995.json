Since the study design involves separating participants into two groups based on a variable (normal vs elevated levels of type B LDL) and measuring the incidence of a health outcome (cardiovascular events), the most appropriate measure of association is the relative risk. Fisher\u2019s exact test is used for categorical data, while likelihood ratios are used to determine the accuracy of a diagnostic test. Odds ratio is often used in case-control studies where the outcome has already occurred, while relative risk is used in cohort studies to compare the risk of an outcome between two groups."
