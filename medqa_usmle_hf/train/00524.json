The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest acute mesenteric ischemia due to a cardiac thromboembolism from his history of atrial fibrillation and recent missed medication. The maroon-colored bowel movements suggest intestinal ischemia. Duodenal compression would not cause the described symptoms. Perforated intestinal mucosal herniation could cause abdominal pain, but the absence of bowel sounds and the severity of the pain are not consistent with this diagnosis. Paradoxical thromboembolism is a rare condition and is unlikely to be the cause of this patient\u2019s symptoms."

The patient presents with acute onset of left lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and maroon-colored bowel movements, which are all signs of ischemic colitis.

The maroon-colored bowel movements suggest bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. Given the patient's medical history, cardiac thromboembolism is the most likely cause of his condition. Other options such as duodenal compression or perforated intestinal mucosal herniation may also cause acute abdomen, but they are less likely in this case. Paradoxical thromboembolism is a rare condition that occurs when a thrombus crosses through a defect in the heart or a blood vessel and enters the systemic circulation. However, it is not a likely cause of this patient's symptoms."

The patient\u2019s history of atrial fibrillation and use of dabigatran suggest a possible cardiac thromboembolism leading to ischemia and infarction of a portion of the bowel. The absence of bowel sounds and abdominal tenderness are consistent with ischemic bowel disease. Option B is unlikely as the duodenum is located in the upper abdomen and the pain is described as being in the left lower quadrant. Option C is possible but less likely as it generally presents with localized pain and tenderness whereas the patient has diffuse abdominal pain. Option D, paradoxical thromboembolism, occurs when a clot from the venous side of circulation crosses over to the arterial side through a shunt, which is not likely in this case given the patient\u2019s history."

Maroon-colored bowel movements indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia, along with his smoking history, puts him at high risk for cardiac thromboembolism. The absence of visible herniation, as well as the lack of evidence for duodenal compression or paradoxical thromboembolism, supports this diagnosis. Immediate attention to anti-coagulation and surgical intervention may be required to prevent further ischemia and possible infarction of intestinal tissue."
