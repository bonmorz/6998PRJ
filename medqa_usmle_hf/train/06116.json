Given the patient's history of cesarean section for placenta previa, painless vaginal bleeding, and fetal decelerations, the most likely diagnosis is placenta previa or placental abruption. Cesarean section is the best next step in management to prevent further fetal distress and ensure delivery of the baby. The other options are not appropriate in this scenario. Betamethasone is used for fetal lung maturation but is not indicated in this emergency situation. A lumbar epidural block may help manage pain during labor, but it is not a priority in this situation where the baby is in distress.
