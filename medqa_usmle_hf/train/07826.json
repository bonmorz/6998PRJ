The patient is likely suffering from tuberculosis, given the chronic cough, cervical lymphadenopathy, positive PPD test, and apical cavitary lesion on chest radiograph. The medication regimen includes isoniazid which inhibits mycobacterial cell wall carbohydrate polymerization. Resistance to this medication is most likely to stem from increased production of mycobacterial enzymes that metabolize or modify the drug, making it ineffective."

Option A (enzymatic drug inactivation) is not a common mechanism of isoniazid resistance. Option B (increased active drug efflux) and option D (metabolic pathway alteration) are not typically associated with isoniazid resistance in tuberculosis."
