Limited weight bearing and physical therapy are the most appropriate next steps in management. This is because a stable slip can be managed with rest and activity restriction while awaiting orthopedic evaluation. Casting and bracing and femoral head pinning are possible treatments but are not the immediate next step unless the orthopedic evaluation reveals this to be necessary. Oral hydroxyurea is not indicated in this case."
