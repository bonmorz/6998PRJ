The combination of pain, stiffness, and swelling in the fingers, worsened by repetitive use, strongly suggests degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis). Option A is unlikely given the lack of systemic symptoms and recent completion of antibiotics. Option B may be considered in the differential diagnosis but is less likely given the absence of other systemic symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Option D is less likely given the lack of mention of chondrocalcinosis or acute attacks of joint pain."

The risk factors for OA include age, female sex, heredity, and joint injury, and the patient has both age and occupation as risk factors. Bacterial infection and autoimmune-mediated cartilage erosion are possible causes in some cases but they are less likely than degenerative disease in this patient. Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal precipitation is associated with pseudogout, which typically affects large joints such as the knee rather than small joints like those in the hand."
