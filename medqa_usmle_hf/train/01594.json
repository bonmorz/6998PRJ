Vitamin B2 is also involved in maintaining healthy skin, while vitamin B6 is involved in regulating mood and behavior. Option A refers to tyrosine which is an amino acid, not a vitamin. Option B is incorrect as niacin synthesis only requires vitamin B2, not B1 or B6. Option C is incorrect as niacin is not used to treat hypertension."
