The symptoms described suggest a possible reactive arthritis, which can occur as a result of a previous gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection. The first step in treatment is typically nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or immunosuppressants to relieve joint pain and inflammation. Intravenous antibiotics are not indicated unless there is evidence of an active infection. Serology for rheumatoid factor is not needed for reactive arthritis. A prostate biopsy is not indicated based on the patient's symptoms."

Serology for rheumatoid factor is not appropriate at this stage, and a prostate biopsy is not relevant to the patient\u2019s symptoms."

Given the patient\u2019s recent history of bloody diarrhea and discomfort with urination, the most likely diagnosis is reactive arthritis. The recommended treatment is NSAIDs or immunosuppressants such as steroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Intravenous antibiotics or prostate biopsy are not indicated in this case, and serology for rheumatoid factor is not specific for reactive arthritis."
