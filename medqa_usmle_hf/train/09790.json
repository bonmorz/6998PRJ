IL-4 plays a key role in B cell class switching and is involved in the production of IgE antibodies, which are associated with allergies and anaphylaxis. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. Option (B) is incorrect as IL-4 stimulates IgE production, not IgA. Option (C) is incorrect as macrophage and Th2 cell activation are associated with IL-13, not IL-4. Option (D) is incorrect as T cell growth and differentiation are mainly driven by IL-2, not IL-4."
