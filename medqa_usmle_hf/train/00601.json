The history of fever and upper respiratory tract symptoms raises the possibility of postinfectious asthma. The patient\u2019s smoking history and hypertension are risk factors for developing asthma. The normal chest x-ray rules out pneumonia, while the nonproductive cough and absence of chest pain suggest that gastroesophageal reflux disease is less likely. Chronic bronchitis is a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that is characterized by productive cough for at least three months in two consecutive years. The absence of sputum production and the duration of symptoms suggest that chronic bronchitis is less likely."
