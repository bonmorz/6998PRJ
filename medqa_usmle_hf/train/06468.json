Plasmapheresis is a known treatment for this condition. The improvement in neurological examination can be explained by an increase in the length constant, which is a measure of how far the axon potential can propagate without decay. This means that the action potential can travel further down the axon, leading to improved muscle function and reflexes. None of the other options would lead to this improvement."

As a result, there is an increase in the length constant, which is a measure of how far a nerve impulse can travel along an axon. This increased length constant allows for better transmission of nerve impulses and could explain the improvement in neurological examination. None of the other options are likely to improve nerve function in this scenario."

Plasmapheresis removes antibodies and complement proteins from the blood, which can help improve symptoms in autoimmune disorders such as Guillain-Barre syndrome.

This is because the antibodies and complement proteins can affect the myelin sheath, leading to a decrease in the length constant."
