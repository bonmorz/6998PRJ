The presence of a petechial rash raises the suspicion of meningococcal meningitis, which is confirmed by the CSF findings of neutrophil-predominant pleocytosis, low glucose, and high protein levels. Option A has a low WBC count and normal glucose levels, which are unlikely in meningitis. Option C has lymphocytic-predominant pleocytosis, which is not typical for meningococcal meningitis. Option D has a low WBC count and high protein levels, which are not consistent with meningitis."

The patient presents with a fever, vomiting, and severe headache, with a pink-purple petechial rash covering her chest and legs. These symptoms suggest a possible meningococcal meningitis infection. The CSF findings for meningococcal meningitis typically show neutrophil-predominant pleocytosis, elevated protein levels, and low glucose levels. Option B is the most likely answer, as it fits with these expected CSF findings. Option A is unlikely, as the patient's white blood cell count is elevated. Option C may indicate a viral meningitis, but the lymphocytic predominance is less likely in meningococcal meningitis. Option D also differs from expected CSF findings in meningococcal meningitis, as the protein levels are very high and the glucose levels are normal."
