Of the options, pancreaticoduodenectomy is the most appropriate next step in management for patients with localized pancreatic cancer without distant metastases. Stereotactic radiation therapy is appropriate for patients who are not surgical candidates, and gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil therapy is used for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Central pancreatectomy is only used for selected cases of benign or low-grade malignant tumors in the neck/body of the pancreas."
