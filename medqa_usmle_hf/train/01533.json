This can result in anemia, which in turn can cause fatigue and headaches. Anemia can lead to decreased oxygen content (Ca02) in the blood, but not necessarily a drop in Pa02 or Sa02, as these are measures of the concentration and saturation of oxygen in the blood, respectively. Therefore, the most likely arterial blood finding would be normal Pa02 and Sa02, but decreased oxygen content (Ca02), which corresponds to option (D)."

Crohn's disease can cause inflammation and scarring in the small intestine, leading to malabsorption of nutrients including iron, which is needed for the formation of hemoglobin. This can result in anemia, which reduces CaO2 without affecting PaO2 or SaO2, leading to a normal PaO2 and SaO2, but a decreased CaO2. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer."
