The presentation of severe shortness of breath, peripheral edema, and weight gain within a week suggests congestive heart failure. Liver changes in congestive heart failure may include centrilobular congestion and hepatocyte atrophy. Budd-Chiari syndrome presents with abdominal pain, ascites, and hepatomegaly. Hepatic metastasis and amebic liver abscess may also cause liver changes, but they are less likely to be the primary cause of the patient's symptoms and sudden cardiac death."
