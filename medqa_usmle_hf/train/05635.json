Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma is characterized by nodular or diffuse infiltrates of lymphocytes and macrophages, while nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin lymphoma is characterized by the presence of nodules with collagen bands. Lymphocyte depleted Hodgkin lymphoma is the rarest form and is characterized by the absence or scarcity of reactive lymphocytes."
