The patient's low hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume suggest iron deficiency anemia, which can be caused by inadequate intake, absorption issues, or blood loss. Checking iron studies can help confirm the diagnosis and reveal the underlying cause. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause anemia but the patient's MCV is low, not high. Hemoglobin electrophoresis and peripheral blood smear are not necessary at this point as the patient's symptoms and lab results point more towards iron deficiency anemia."

Vitamin B12 deficiency may also cause anemia, but there are no symptoms suggestive of B12 deficiency. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is used to diagnose different types of hemoglobinopathies, which are unlikely given the patient's history. Peripheral blood smear is helpful for detecting abnormal cells, but it is not the initial step in management."

The patient has symptoms suggestive of iron-deficiency anemia, including fatigue, low energy levels, and pale conjunctivae. The low hemoglobin and small mean corpuscular volume support this diagnosis. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in management is to perform iron studies to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the anemia. Vitamin B12 deficiency may cause similar symptoms, but the normal platelet count makes this diagnosis less likely. Hemoglobin electrophoresis and peripheral blood smear are not initial steps in the evaluation of suspected iron-deficiency anemia."
