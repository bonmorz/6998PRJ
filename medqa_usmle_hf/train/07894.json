Removing all peripheral IV\u2019s could be considered if there is concern for local site infection, but it is not the most likely source of the bloodstream infection.

A lumbar puncture can be considered if there are signs of meningitis, but these are not present in this case. Adding micafungin may be considered if there is suspicion of a fungal infection, but this would be a secondary step after removing the central line and confirming the cause of the infection. Removing all peripheral IVs and sending them for cultures is not as high of a priority as removing the central line."

Option A is not appropriate without evidence of fungal infection. Option B is not necessary as the peripheral IVs were newly placed while in the ICU, and the femoral line has already been removed.

Therefore, the central line is the most likely source of infection and should be removed and sent for cultures. Option A of adding micafungin assumes a fungal infection, which is not indicated as the blood cultures were positive. Option B of removing all peripheral IVs is not necessary since the femoral line was already removed and the peripheral IVs were placed after the patient's initial improvement. Option D of performing a lumbar puncture is not indicated as there are no signs or symptoms suggesting meningitis."

Therefore, the central line should be removed and sent for cultures to identify the source of the infection. Option A is incorrect as there is no reason to suspect a fungal infection, and micafungin is not indicated in this case. Option B is not the best next step as the patient\u2019s symptoms indicate a central line infection, and removing the peripheral IVs will not solve the problem. Option D may be considered if meningitis is suspected, but the patient does not report any symptoms suggestive of meningitis such as headache, neck stiffness, or photophobia. Thus, Option C is the best next step in the management of this patient."
