This is a common finding in critically ill patients and is thought to be due to peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 being decreased during severe illness. Medication toxicity, fibrous thyroiditis, and pituitary apoplexy are not as likely to cause these specific laboratory abnormalities."

The TSH is normal while T3 and T4 are low, which indicates a sick euthyroid syndrome. This is a condition that occurs in critically ill patients and is characterized by low thyroid hormones despite normal TSH levels. It is thought to be due to the effects of cytokines released during an acute illness on thyroid hormone metabolism. Medication toxicity, fibrous thyroiditis, and pituitary apoplexy would have different clinical presentations and laboratory findings."

Additionally, the TSH is normal but the free T3 and T4 are low. This suggests a sick euthyroid syndrome, which is a decrease in thyroid hormone levels due to systemic illness rather than primary thyroid dysfunction.
