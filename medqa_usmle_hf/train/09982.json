The patient has two palpable testes and a blind vagina with slight clitoromegaly, which is consistent with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency.

Option (C) is incorrect as corpus spongiosum is homologous to the corpus cavernosum clitoridis in females."

The scrotum in males is homologous to the labia majora in females. Option A is incorrect because the bulbourethral glands are only present in males, while the urethral and paraurethral glands are homologous to the prostate gland in males. Option B is incorrect because the clitoral crura are homologous to the corpus cavernosum in males, not the corpus spongiosum. Option C is incorrect because the greater vestibular glands are homologous to the bulbourethral glands in males, not the corpus spongiosum."
