This can cause a decrease in estrogen levels which leads to vaginal dryness, hot flashes, irregular periods, and pain during intercourse. As a result, FSH levels often increase and LH levels may decrease, leading to an increased FSH to LH ratio. GnRH and TSH levels are not typically affected in premature ovarian failure."

The patient\u2019s symptoms and history of irregular periods suggest a possible diagnosis of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). The atrophic cervix and vagina also support this diagnosis. In POI, there is a decrease in functional follicles, leading to elevated FSH and a decreased estrogen-to-progesterone ratio. LH levels may be normal or slightly decreased. GnRH levels are not typically affected, and TSH levels are not relevant to this condition. Thus, the most likely finding in this patient is an increased FSH to LH ratio."
