The patient has end-stage renal disease and poorly managed diabetes mellitus, and the laboratory values show metabolic acidosis with elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine. The patient is non-compliant with his medications, and given his history and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is congestive heart failure. Long-term therapy for this patient should include an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker, which can cause hypotension as a side effect, not hypertension. Hyperkalemia and visual halos are also not side-effects of this therapy. Therefore, the correct answer is none of the above."

The laboratory values show a low HCO3- level, which indicates metabolic acidosis. This could be caused by poorly managed diabetes, end-stage renal disease, or both. Treatment for this patient should include starting erythropoietin and iron therapy to manage the anemia, correcting his acidosis, and addressing his non-adherence to his medications. Among the options, the most likely side-effect of long-term therapy is hypertension, due to the patient\u2019s poorly managed hypertension and non-compliance with his medications. There is no indication of hyperkalemia or hypokalemia in the lab values provided. Visual halos are not a common side-effect of the medications listed in the patient\u2019s current medication regimen."

His laboratory results show metabolic acidosis, anemia, and mild leukopenia, which could all be attributed to his renal failure. The most likely cause of his shortness of breath is fluid overload, which could be improved with diuretic therapy. Hypertension is a side-effect of long-term diuretic therapy, which the patient should be started on right now. Hyperkalemia and hypokalemia are potential side-effects of potassium-sparing and potassium-depleting diuretic therapy, respectively. Visual halos are a potential side-effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibitor therapy, which is not indicated in this patient."

The patient\u2019s laboratory results indicate that he has metabolic acidosis, likely caused by poorly managed diabetes mellitus and end stage renal disease. The patient is also non-compliant with his medications, which may have contributed to the progression of his shortness of breath. The most appropriate treatment for this patient is to start long-term therapy with a diuretic to manage his hypertension and edema. Therefore, the most likely side-effect of this therapy is hypertension. Hyperkalemia is a potential side-effect of potassium-sparing diuretics, but it is not the best answer for this scenario. Hypokalemia is often treated with potassium-sparing diuretics, but it is not the best answer for this patient since his potassium level is in the normal range. Visual halos are not a known side-effect of diuretic therapy."

The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on various medications such as lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and ibuprofen. These medications all have side effects that can contribute to worsening of the patient\u2019s condition. The patient\u2019s low Hemoglobin and hematocrit suggest anemia, which can contribute to the shortness of breath. Given the patient's history of poorly controlled hypertension, starting him on a long-term antihypertensive medication such as calcium channel blockers would be appropriate.

The patient presents with shortness of breath and a history of poorly managed hypertension, suggesting that the shortness of breath may be caused by pulmonary hypertension. The laboratory values show that the patient has metabolic acidosis with a low HCO3-, suggesting chronic kidney disease. While the patient's potassium levels are within normal range, the patient is on hydrochlorothiazide which is a diuretic that increases excretion of potassium, making hypokalemia a possible side-effect. However, the question is asking for the side-effect of long-term therapy, which is likely to be aimed at treating the patient's hypertension. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Hypertension, as treating hypertension can lead to the possibility of hypotension or low blood pressure."
