The patient has a significant carotid stenosis on the left side with symptoms such as systolic bruits over the neck bilaterally, and the duplex ultrasonography confirms the diagnosis. Therefore, left carotid endarterectomy is the most appropriate next step in management. Reassurance is not appropriate as the patient has a significant carotid stenosis. Carotid artery stenting is an option, but endarterectomy is the preferred treatment for significant stenosis. Bilateral carotid endarterectomy is not necessary as the right side only has a 55% stenosis, which does not meet the criteria for intervention."
