The symptoms and the history of recurrent respiratory infections and ear infections suggest that the underlying cause is a primary ciliary dyskinesia, which is also known as Kartagener syndrome. The chest X-ray shows dextroversion of the heart, which is a classic finding in Kartagener syndrome. Cystic fibrosis is associated with respiratory infections but is not the primary cause of recurrent infections in this case. Common variable immune deficiency and X-linked agammaglobulinemia are both primary immunodeficiencies that can also cause recurrent infections, but they are less likely given the patient's normal immune system function and developmental milestones."

The boy has multiple respiratory tract infections and ear infections, and the previous chest X-ray shows situs inversus, which is strongly suggestive of Kartagener syndrome. Cystic fibrosis and common variable immune deficiency can also cause recurrent infections, but they do not have situs inversus as a characteristic feature. X-linked agammaglobulinemia is a rare genetic disorder that affects primarily males and causes recurrent bacterial infections due to the inability to produce immunoglobulins. However, this disorder would usually present earlier in life and is typically associated with a family history of the disorder."

The recurrent ear infections and respiratory tract infections with productive cough suggest underlying primary ciliary dyskinesia, also known as Kartagener syndrome.

Cystic fibrosis typically presents with other symptoms as well, including GI issues and salty-tasting skin. Common variable immune deficiency and X-linked agammaglobulinemia typically present with recurrent bacterial infections of the respiratory and GI tract, but not necessarily with ear infections."
