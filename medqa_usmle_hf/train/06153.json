The patient is a former smoker, and chest CT scan is recommended for lung cancer screening in individuals with a history of smoking. The recommended age for starting screening varies, but it is usually between 55-80 years old. Abdominal ultrasound is not recommended for routine screening in asymptomatic individuals, and the patient had normal pap smears and colonoscopy in the past. Chest radiograph is not as sensitive as chest CT scan for detecting lung cancer. Thus, the best next test for this patient would be a chest CT scan for lung cancer screening."
