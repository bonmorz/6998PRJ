The patient presents with chest trauma and has paradoxical inward movement in the right chest wall, suggesting a possible pneumothorax. The low oxygen saturation also suggests respiratory distress. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is intubation with positive pressure ventilation to stabilize the patient's breathing and oxygenation. A CT scan may be ordered after stabilization, but it is not the immediate next step. Bedside thoracotomy and surgical fixation of the ribs are also not appropriate at this time."

The paradoxical inward movement of the right chest wall indicates a shift of the mediastinum and compression of the contralateral lung. The patient's confusion and oxygen saturation of 83% indicates hypoxia. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to intubate the patient with positive pressure ventilation to provide oxygen and decompress the tension pneumothorax. CT scan of the chest can be performed later for further evaluation, and surgical fixation of ribs is not indicated in this acute setting. Bedside thoracotomy is a last-resort measure and should only be considered in cases of cardiac arrest."
