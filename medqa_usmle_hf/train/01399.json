The patient is repressing his grief over the loss of his mother by quickly turning the conversation to focus on something positive, in this case, baseball tryouts. Denial is the refusal to acknowledge a real situation or feeling, displacement is the redirection of feelings towards a substitute target, and suppression is the conscious push of unwanted feelings or memories into the unconscious.
