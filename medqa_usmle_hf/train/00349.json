The widened mediastinum seen on chest X-ray is a classic finding in aortic dissection. The absence of pulses in the right leg and diminished pulses in the left suggest vascular compromise, which can occur in aortic dissection. Rib fracture, myocardial rupture, and diaphragmatic rupture are less likely to cause these specific findings."

The symptoms suggest that the most likely cause is traumatic aortic dissection, which presents with tearing chest pain and a widened mediastinum on chest X-ray. The difference in blood pressure between the right and left arms is also a characteristic finding. Rib fracture may cause chest pain but not a widened mediastinum. Myocardial rupture is unlikely to occur without history of cardiac disease or trauma to the chest. Diaphragmatic rupture would not explain the chest pain and absent pulses in the right leg."
