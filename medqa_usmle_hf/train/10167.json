The most appropriate action by the physician would be to clarify the daughter's reasons for the request. The physician should try to understand the daughter's concerns and fears and address them while respecting the patient's autonomy and right to information. However, if the patient still wants to know the truth, the physician should disclose the diagnosis to the patient. It is important to foster open communication and trust between the patient, family, and physician throughout the course of the illness."

The principle of autonomy states that patients have the right to make decisions about their health care, and this includes the right to receive or reject information about their diagnosis. However, the principle of beneficence requires that physicians act in the patient's best interest. The most appropriate action in this scenario is to clarify the daughter's reasons for the request, as this will help the physician understand the dynamics of the patient's family and their concerns. The physician should also explain the importance of informed decision-making and encourage the daughter to have an open and honest conversation with her mother about her diagnosis. Ultimately, the patient has the right to know her diagnosis, but the physician should respect the daughter's request and work collaboratively with the patient and her family to ensure that her care reflects her values and preferences."
