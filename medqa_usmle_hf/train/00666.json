The patient has a history of GBS infection in her previous pregnancy, which puts her at high risk for GBS colonization in this pregnancy.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to administer intrapartum intravenous penicillin to prevent GBS transmission to the newborn. Option A and C are incorrect because GBS swab culture alone may not be helpful in preventing GBS transmission during labor, and nucleic acid amplification testing may not be available or have quick results. Option D is incorrect because it does not address the immediate risk of GBS transmission during labor."
