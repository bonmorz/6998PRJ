The patient has a fever, fatigue, and petechiae which can suggest a decreased production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the bone marrow. The low hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet counts, hypocellularity on bone marrow aspirate, and normochromic, normocytic cells on the peripheral blood smear indicate aplastic anemia. Multiple myeloma usually presents with bone pain and hypercalcemia. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura presents with petechiae and bruising, but a normal leukocyte count. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia may present with low platelet counts, but usually, have a high leukocyte count."
