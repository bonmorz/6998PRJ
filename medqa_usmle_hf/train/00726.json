Option A, abdominal ultrasound, may be used for confirming the diagnosis but is not necessary at this point. Option C, pyloromyotomy, is the definitive treatment for pyloric stenosis but should only be considered after the patient has been adequately hydrated. Option D, thickening feeds, may provide temporary relief, but intravenous hydration should be initiated first."
