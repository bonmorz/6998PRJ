This patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a dysfunction of the superior oblique muscle, which is innervated by the trochlear nerve. Its primary action is intorsion, and its secondary action is depression and abduction. The lateral rectus muscle, innervated by the abducens nerve, causes abduction of the eye. The inferior oblique muscle, innervated by the oculomotor nerve, causes elevation, extorsion, and abduction of the eye. The inferior rectus muscle, also innervated by the oculomotor nerve, causes depression, extorsion, and abduction of the eye."
