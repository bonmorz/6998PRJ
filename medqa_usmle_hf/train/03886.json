The symptoms suggest malignant hyperthermia, a rare but potentially lethal complication of anesthesia which can be triggered by certain medications such as haloperidol. The treatment for malignant hyperthermia is dantrolene therapy. Fat embolectomy is used to treat pulmonary embolism, which is not indicated here. Cyproheptadine can help treat serotonin syndrome, which is not the diagnosis here. Propranolol is a beta blocker that can help treat hypertension and other cardiac conditions, but it is not indicated for malignant hyperthermia."
