The patient\u2019s symptoms of bilateral lower extremity swelling after starting a new medication suggests that it is most likely a calcium channel blocker, which can cause peripheral edema as a side effect. Inhibition of hormone receptor is unlikely to cause such symptoms. Potassium-sparing diuretics may prevent edema but not cause it, and potassium-wasting diuretics can actually worsen edema."
