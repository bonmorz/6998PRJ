The patient's anemia, along with her symptoms, suggests that prednisone therapy is the most appropriate next step in treatment. The anemia is likely due to inflammation related to her Crohn disease, and prednisone can help reduce inflammation and improve symptoms. Erythropoietin injection can be used for anemia in certain situations, but is not typically the first-line treatment for anemia related to inflammatory bowel disease. Metronidazole is used to treat bacterial infections and vitamin B12 supplementation is unlikely to address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms."

The patient has a history of Crohn's disease which increases the risk of anemia, and the laboratory results show low hemoglobin, MCV, and reticulocyte count, indicating iron deficiency anemia. Oral prednisone therapy is the most appropriate next step in treatment as it can help reduce inflammation in Crohn's disease and improve anemia. Erythropoietin injection is used to treat anemia due to kidney failure. Metronidazole is an antibiotic and would not help in this case. Vitamin B12 supplementation is used to treat megaloblastic anemia, primarily caused by a deficiency of vitamin B12 or folate, which is not seen in this patient."

Subcutaneous erythropoietin injection may be considered in cases of severe anemia, but it is not the first-line treatment here. Intravenous metronidazole therapy is used in cases of severe Crohn disease with active inflammation, but there is no evidence of this on physical exam or laboratory results. Oral vitamin B12 supplementation may be considered in cases of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, but this is not the most likely cause of anemia in this patient."
