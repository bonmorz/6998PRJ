The patient has a known history of esophageal varices and presents with bloody vomiting, which is concerning for potential bleeding from the varices.

Endoscopy is the next step in management to evaluate the source and severity of bleeding and potentially perform interventions such as band ligation or sclerotherapy. FFP is not indicated as the patient's coagulation profile is within normal limits, TIPS is not indicated as it is a more invasive procedure and usually reserved for refractory cases of bleeding, and a non-selective \u00df-blocker is already being used for prophylaxis of variceal bleeding."
