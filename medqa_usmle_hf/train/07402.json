                "content": "We refer to the given data from the randomized controlled trial. Out of the 1500 patients who were given losartan, 300 patients had cardiovascular death and 1200 did not. This means that the incidence of cardiovascular death in the losartan group is 300/1500 = 0.2 or 20%. In the placebo group, the incidence of cardiovascular death is 350/1400 = 0.25 or 25%. This means that the placebo group had a 5% higher incidence of cardiovascular death than the losartan group. So, if 200 patients with congestive heart failure and an ejection fraction < 30% were treated with losartan, approximately 10 cases of cardiovascular death would be prevented (i.e., 5% of 200). Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."

If we treat 200 patients, we can expect to prevent 200/40 = 5 cases of cardiovascular death. However, the question asks for the average number of cases prevented, so we need to divide by the total number of patients:\n(5/200) x 100 = 2.5%\nTherefore, on average, we can expect losartan to prevent 2.5% of cases of cardiovascular death in patients with congestive heart failure and an ejection fraction < 30% who are already being treated with an ACE inhibitor and beta blocker. This corresponds to 10 patients out of 400 (200 in the losartan group and 200 in the placebo group). Answer choice (B) is correct."

Since we are treating 200 patients, we can expect to prevent 200/20 = 10 cases of cardiovascular death with losartan. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."

Therefore, the NNT is 1/0.02 = 50. This means that for every 50 patients treated with losartan, one case of cardiovascular death will be prevented.

The ARR is the difference in the event rates between the treatment group (losartan) and the control group (placebo), so ARR = (350/1400) - (300/1500) = 0.018. This means that losartan reduces the risk of cardiovascular death by 1.8%. The NNT is the reciprocal of the ARR, so NNT = 1/0.018 = 55.6. This means that for every 55.6 patients treated with losartan, one case of cardiovascular death will be prevented. Since we are treating 200 patients, we can estimate that approximately 200/55.6 = 3.6 cases of cardiovascular death would be prevented. However, since we are asked for the average number of cases prevented, we should round down to the nearest whole number, which is 3. Therefore, the answer is (B) 10."

This means that adding losartan would prevent 2.5% of cardiovascular deaths. To calculate the number of cases prevented out of 200 patients, we multiply 0.025 by 200, which equals 5. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 10, as 10 cardiovascular deaths would be prevented out of 400 total patients (200 in the losartan group and 200 in the placebo group)."

Therefore, treating 200 patients with losartan, we can prevent 200/40 = 5 deaths. However, the question asks for how many cases of cardiovascular death would be prevented on average, so we need to divide by the number of patients treated (200) and multiply by the number of patients in the losartan group (1500): (5/200) x 1500 = 37.5 or approximately 10 cardiovascular deaths would be prevented on average.
