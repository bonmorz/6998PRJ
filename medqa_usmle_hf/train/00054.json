The chest x-ray shows a possible nodule in the lung, but without further information, it is difficult to determine the nature of the nodule. Requesting previous chest x-rays can help determine if the nodule is new or old. Arterial blood gas analysis is not necessary at this point as the patient is not experiencing any respiratory symptoms. CT-guided biopsy may be necessary if there is a suspicion of malignancy, but it is premature at this point. Measurement of angiotensin-converting enzyme is not helpful in this scenario as it is used to diagnose sarcoidosis, which is not suspected at this time."
