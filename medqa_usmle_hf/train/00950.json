There is also tenderness and limited mobility in the right wrist, which suggests a possible fracture or sprain. However, the most important concern in a fall from height is cervical spine injury. Therefore, CT scan of the cervical spine is the most appropriate next step in management to rule out any cervical spine injury. X-ray of the neck is not as sensitive as CT scan in detecting cervical spine injury. Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) is used to assess for free fluid in the abdomen and chest, which may indicate internal bleeding. X-ray of the right wrist should also be performed to rule out any fracture or sprain."
