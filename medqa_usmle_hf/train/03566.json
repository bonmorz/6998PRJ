The patient\u2019s history of heavy drinking and subsequent withdrawal symptoms point toward delirium tremens, which is caused by withdrawal from alcohol after chronic heavy use. One of the main mechanisms behind this condition is an increased activity of NMDA receptors in the brain. This overactivity leads to hyperexcitability and can cause the symptoms seen in this patient, such as agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. The other options, functional increase in GABA, increased inhibition of norepinephrine, and increased inhibition of glutamate, do not relate to the pathophysiology of delirium tremens."

Increased activity of NMDA receptors is the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism. In alcoholics, long-term excessive alcohol consumption leads to down-regulation of NMDA receptors, which causes excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate to be more pronounced than inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. When alcohol is abruptly stopped, an excess of glutamate can result in seizures, agitation, delirium, and hallucinations."

The patient is displaying symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including hallucinations, increased heart rate, and agitation.

Functional increase in GABA, increased inhibition of norepinephrine, and increased inhibition of glutamate are not mechanisms that are specifically involved in alcohol withdrawal."

The patient shows symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, and among the options, increased activity of NMDA receptors is the most appropriate answer. This is because chronic alcohol intake can cause NMDA receptor downregulation, and when alcohol is suddenly withdrawn, there is an increase in NMDA receptor activity leading to symptoms of withdrawal."
