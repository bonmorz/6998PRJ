The partial filling defect suggests an thrombus, which can lead to ischemia of the affected bowel regions. The answer choice with the splenic flexure, descending colon, and sigmoid colon is at greatest risk because the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) supplies those regions and it arises from the abdominal aorta just above the level of the L4 vertebra, where the aneurysm extends to. In contrast, the hepatic flexure, transverse colon, and splenic flexure are supplied by the SMA, which arises higher from the aorta. The cecum, ileum, and distal jejunum are supplied by the ileocolic artery and branches of the SMA, so they have some collateral blood supply. The ascending colon, cecum, and distal ileum are also supplied by the ileocolic artery and branches of the SMA, but have slightly less collateral blood supply compared to the cecum, ileum, and distal jejunum."
