The fetal heart rate is reassuring, so there is no need for immediate intervention such as cesarean delivery. Offering anesthesia or admitting for monitoring may be premature at this time. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to provide reassurance and discharge the patient with instructions to return if the contractions become stronger or more frequent, or if she has any concerns."
