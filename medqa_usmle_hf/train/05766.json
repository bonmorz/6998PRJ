The patient\u2019s clinical features suggest Marfan syndrome, which is associated with a deficiency of connective tissue. Supplementation of vitamin B6, a required cofactor for the synthesis of collagen and elastin, can help improve the connective tissue abnormalities seen in Marfan syndrome. Supplementation of methionine is used in the treatment of homocystinuria, which is also associated with intellectual disability and ophthalmological abnormalities but presents with more of a thrombotic tendency. Restriction of phenylalanine is used in the treatment of phenylketonuria, which presents with intellectual disability but no ophthalmological findings. Restriction of cysteine is used in the treatment of cystinuria, which presents with recurrent renal stones."
