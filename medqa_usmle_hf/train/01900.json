Since the patient has epigastric discomfort following meals and an occasional dry cough, lifestyle modifications would be the most appropriate next step in patient management. These include avoiding trigger foods or drinks, eating smaller and more frequent meals, avoiding lying down for at least 2 hours after meals, and modifying sleeping positions. Omeprazole therapy can also be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step. An electrocardiogram and fluoroscopic barium swallow would not be indicated based on the presentation."
