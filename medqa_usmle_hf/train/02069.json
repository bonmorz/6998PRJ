The patient has symptoms of hyperglycemia and is started on a drug that binds to an ATP-gated potassium channel, which suggests that the patient has diabetes mellitus post-transplant. This is a known complication of calcineurin inhibitors, which bind to FKBP-12 to inhibit calcineurin. Option A is incorrect because calcineurin inhibition is associated with hyperglycemia, not hypoglycemia. Option C is incorrect because inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitors are used to treat rejection and have no known association with hyperglycemia. Option D is incorrect because targeting the a-chain of the IL-2 receptor is used for immunosuppression, not diabetes management."

The medication that binds to ATP-gated potassium channels is likely sulfonylureas, which stimulate insulin secretion from beta cells in the pancreas. The drug that increases the risk of the complication experienced by this patient most likely inhibits calcineurin, which is a target of immunosuppressive drugs like cyclosporine and tacrolimus. They can cause new-onset diabetes mellitus as a side effect. Among the options, only (B) binds to FKBP-12 to inhibit calcineurin."
