This is characterized by increased intracranial pressure without any underlying structural cause. The papilledema, abducens nerve palsy, and photopsias indicate optic nerve damage and the T1/T2 MRI and lumbar puncture ruled out any structural causes or infections. Elevated intracranial venous pressure is a known pathogenic mechanism of IIH, which can cause damage to the optic nerves and lead to papilledema."

The combination of symptoms, including headache, tinnitus, photopsia, and peripheral visual field loss in the inferior nasal quadrant, suggest that the patient has idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The elevated intracranial pressure causes papilledema and bilateral abducens nerve palsy. The normal cerebrospinal fluid analysis suggests that there is not an intra-axial or extra-axial mass or inflammation present. The absence of a mass suggests that arachnoid granulation adhesion is not causing the IIH. The absence of an increase in CSF production means that the cause of the IIH is not CSF overproduction, and the absence of systemic hypertension rules out systemic hypertension as the cause. Therefore, elevated intracranial venous pressure is the most likely pathogenic mechanism underlying the patient\u2019s symptoms."

The symptoms and examination findings suggest increased intracranial pressure, and the normal CSF analysis indicates that the cause is likely external to the brain or CSF. The presence of papilledema is indicative of elevated intracranial pressure. The most likely underlying mechanism for this is elevated intracranial venous pressure, which can be caused by venous sinus thrombosis, obstructive sleep apnea, or other factors. Arachnoid granulation adhesions, increased cerebrospinal production, and systemic hypertension are less likely causes of these findings."

The symptoms and physical examination findings suggest idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), previously known as pseudotumor cerebri. Elevated intracranial venous pressure is the underlying pathogenic mechanism in IIH, which can cause optic disc swelling and abducens nerve palsy.

Systemic hypertension can contribute to secondary intracranial hypertension, but it is not the underlying cause of IIH."
