The midsystolic click followed by a late-systolic high-pitched murmur over the cardiac apex is most likely due to mitral valve prolapse. On standing, the murmur is of increased intensity due to decreased peripheral resistance, and while squatting, the murmur is softer in intensity due to increased venous return. Echocardiography of this patient will most likely show prolapse of a mitral valve leaflet of \u22652 mm above the level of the annulus in systole."

The midsystolic click followed by a late-systolic high-pitched murmur over the cardiac apex suggests mitral valve prolapse (MVP).

High pressure gradient across the aortic valve (option B) is seen in aortic stenosis, and left atrial mass arising from the region of the septal fossa ovalis (option D) is rare and not commonly associated with MVP."

Option A is indicative of mitral valve prolapse syndrome, but it is not the answer as it doesn't specify the prolapse of the valve. Option B and D are not related to the symptoms described."
