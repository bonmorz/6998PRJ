Fosphenytoin is a second-line drug used for status epilepticus, which the patient may be experiencing given the violent and prolonged nature of his seizure. Fosphenytoin alters the flow of sodium ions across neuronal membranes and can help control seizures. Topiramate and carbamazepine are also antiepileptic drugs, but they are not typically used in the emergency setting for acute seizures. Phenobarbital may be used for long-term seizure management but is not typically used in the acute setting either."
