The weakness of the left leg, urinary incontinence, and decreased sensation on the left lower extremity suggests a neurological issue.

The absence of visual abnormalities also rules out a posterior cerebral artery occlusion. Hypertensive encephalopathy typically presents with headache, seizures, and altered mental status, which are not present in this case."

The symptoms suggest a neurological deficit on the left side, including weakness, decreased sensation, and an extensor response, indicating damage to the motor cortex or pyramidal tract. The inability to complete counting backward and speech production difficulties suggest a lesion in the frontal lobe, specifically the dominant hemisphere. The anterior cerebral artery supplies the medial aspect of the frontal and parietal lobes, which includes the motor and sensory cortex, and is most likely affected in this patient. Hypertensive encephalopathy usually presents with a headache and altered mental status, but physical exam findings are typically normal. Posterior cerebral artery occlusions can affect the visual system and would present with visual field defects."
