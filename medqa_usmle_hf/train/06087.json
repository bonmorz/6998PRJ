The patient has a positive straight leg test, indicating nerve irritation in the legs, and has a herniated disc at L5 on MRI. These findings suggest lumbar disc herniation. The patient\u2019s monoclonal component is an incidental finding and does not directly impact his treatment. Physical therapy is the most appropriate next step to manage the patient\u2019s pain and improve his function. Dexamethasone is a steroid medication that can be used for short-term pain relief in patients with disc herniation, but physical therapy should be tried first. Plasmapheresis is not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of an underlying autoimmune disorder. Thalidomide is used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, but is not indicated in this patient as he has no evidence of bone lesions."
