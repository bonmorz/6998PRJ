Displacement is the defense mechanism where an individual directs their emotional feelings, such as frustration or anger, towards a substitute target. In this case, the patient directed his frustrations towards the family pet, resulting in the bite. Projection involves attributing one's own unacceptable thoughts or feelings onto another person or object. Reaction formation involves acting in a manner that is opposite to one's true wishes or desires. Regression involves returning to earlier, immature behaviors."
