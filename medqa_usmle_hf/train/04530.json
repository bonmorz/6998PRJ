The patient's symptoms and recent travel history suggest possible cholera infection, which is caused by the bacteria Vibrio cholerae. Cholera toxin produced by the bacteria increases cyclic AMP levels in intestinal cells, leading to increased ion secretion and water loss in the stool, resulting in profuse watery diarrhea. Therefore, the likely mechanism of this patient's diarrhea is Increased cyclic AMP. The immediate oral rehydration therapy is recommended to prevent dehydration."

The descriptions of the patient's symptoms suggest that the likely mechanism of his diarrhea is increased cyclic AMP, which is consistent with the presence of comma-shaped organisms in the stool. These organisms are Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, which produces cholera toxin that increases cyclic AMP secretion in the intestinal mucosa. This leads to increased secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen and causes profuse diarrhea. The recommendation for oral rehydration therapy is appropriate as it helps replace the lost fluids and electrolytes."
