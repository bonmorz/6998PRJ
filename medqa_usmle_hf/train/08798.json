The mutation described in the question stem is associated with cystic fibrosis, which primarily affects the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. The defect in protein folding leads to decreased function of the chloride channel CFTR, resulting in thick mucus production and impaired clearance. Among the options, chloride channels are only present in sweat glands and respiratory epithelial cells, so the correct answer is (B) sodium channels of respiratory epithelial cells."

This disease affects the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. The defect causes an abnormal protein folding, which impairs chloride transport across the cell membrane. As a result, there is an increase in sodium and water absorption, which causes thick mucus accumulation in the respiratory tract. The sodium channels of respiratory epithelial cells are the most likely to be affected by the defect, as the defect causes an increase in sodium absorption."

The given genetic defect describes cystic fibrosis, which affects the chloride channels of the epithelial cells in various organs, including the respiratory epithelial cells. Sodium channels are also affected, leading to increased sodium absorption and decreased water secretion, resulting in thick and sticky secretions that impede proper functioning of the organs. Therefore, option B - sodium channels of respiratory epithelial cells, is the correct answer."

The deletion of the 508th codon in a gene on chromosome 7 is characteristic of cystic fibrosis, which is caused by a defect in chloride channels of epithelial cells. However, none of the answer choices directly refer to chloride channels. Among the answer choices, only Sodium channels of respiratory epithelial cells are affected by cystic fibrosis. Sodium channels are responsible for fluid balance in respiratory epithelial cells, and their increased activity in cystic fibrosis leads to dehydration of the airway surface liquid, causing the thick mucus characteristic of the disease."
