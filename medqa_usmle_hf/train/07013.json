The symptoms and urine studies suggest that the most likely cause of the findings is Type 1 diabetes, which is characterized by insulin deficiency. The weight loss, increased frequency of micturition, and nocturia are typical symptoms of diabetes. The presence of glucose in the urine is also a characteristic feature of diabetes. Elevated thyroxine levels usually result in hyperthyroidism, which can cause weight loss, but would not explain the presence of glucose in the urine. Infection of the urinary tract does not explain the weight loss or the glucose in the urine. Insulin resistance is a feature of Type 2 diabetes, which usually presents later in life and is associated with obesity."
