The most common type of lesion derived from Rathke's pouch is a craniopharyngioma, which is a cystic tumor that can cause symptoms like polydipsia and polyuria as well as visual field defects like bitemporal hemianopia due to compression of the optic chiasm. The most likely histologic finding in a craniopharyngioma is cystic spaces, as the tumor is lined with stratified squamous epithelium and contains keratin debris. Liquefactive necrosis, lymphocytic infiltrate, and branching papillae are not characteristic findings in craniopharyngiomas."
