The patient\u2019s history of chronic lower back pain and taking NSAIDs for the past 3 weeks suggest that the most likely cause of the presentation is chronic NSAID use, which is known to cause peptic ulcer disease. However, the presence of multiple ulcers in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum, as well as the patient\u2019s history of recurrent nephrolithiasis, raise the possibility of a gastrin-secreting tumor of the pancreas, which causes multiple ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract. H. pylori infection can also cause peptic ulcer disease, but it is less likely in this case given the patient\u2019s short duration of NSAID use and absence of other risk factors for H. pylori infection. Cytomegalovirus infection can cause gastrointestinal ulcers in immunocompromised patients, but the patient\u2019s medical history does not suggest immunosuppression."

However, the fact that the patient had multiple ulcers in different parts of the GI tract is not typical for NSAID-induced ulcers and raises suspicion for a gastrin-secreting tumor of the pancreas, which can cause multiple ulcers throughout the GI tract. H. pylori infection is another common cause of gastric ulcers but is less likely in this case given the patient's recent NSAID use and multiple ulcers. Cytomegalovirus infection can also cause gastric ulcers in immunocompromised patients but is less likely in this case given the patient's history of recurrent nephrolithiasis and chronic lower back pain but no underlying immunodeficiency."
