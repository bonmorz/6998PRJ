Among the options, submucosa and muscularis externa are the layers responsible for peristalsis and movement of contents through the gut, and an abnormality in these layers could result in obstruction."

The patient's symptoms most likely indicate Hirschsprung disease, which is caused by an absence of ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses of the colon. This absence can cause a functional obstruction and lead to symptoms such as abdominal distention, vomiting, and constipation. Therefore, the abnormal development of the submucosa and muscularis externa best explains the patient's condition."
