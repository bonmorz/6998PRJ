The symptoms and physical exam findings suggest the patient is suffering from pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune disease that causes blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. The disease is caused by IgG antibodies against desmoglein-3, a transmembrane protein that helps bind neighboring epidermal cells together. Therefore, (D) is the correct answer. Autoantibodies against hemidesmosomes are seen in pemphigoid, exotoxins destroying keratinocyte attachments are seen in Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, and IgA antibodies depositing in the dermal papillae are seen in Dermatitis herpetiformis."
