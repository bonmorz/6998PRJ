The fact that the urine osmolality increased with fluid deprivation but not as much with ADH analog suggests partial central diabetes insipidus. Primary polydipsia would not show an increase in serum sodium. Osmotic diuresis would show an increase in urine volume with high serum glucose levels."

The water deprivation test results show that the patient's urine osmolality increased after the administration of ADH analog, indicating that the kidneys are sensitive to ADH. This suggests partial central diabetes insipidus. Complete central diabetes insipidus would result in urine osmolality that remains low even after the administration of ADH analog. Primary polydipsia would result in urine osmolality that does not increase significantly during the water deprivation test. Osmotic diuresis would result in increased urine output due to an osmotic diuretic such as glucose, but the patient's laboratory results do not indicate osmotic diuresis."
