The patient is experiencing symptoms of menopause, such as vaginal dryness and hot flushes, which are caused by decreased estrogen levels. With decreased estrogen levels, there will be an increase in FSH and LH levels due to the lack of estrogen feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which will increase the secretion of GnRH.
