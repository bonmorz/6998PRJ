The patient has a history of sexually transmitted infections despite using oral contraceptive pills, indicating a need for additional protection against STDs. Condoms are the only answer choice that provides such protection. Intrauterine devices do not protect against STDs. The pull-out method has a high failure rate and does not protect against STDs. Tubal ligation is a permanent form of contraception and is not recommended for a 23-year-old who may wish to have children in the future."
