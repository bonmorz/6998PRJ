The constant chest pain with no abnormalities in the heart or lungs and the esophageal thickening seen on CT scan suggest that the most likely diagnosis is pill esophagitis, which is inflammation of the esophagus due to medication. Diffuse esophageal spasm may cause chest pain but would also show abnormalities on the ECG.
