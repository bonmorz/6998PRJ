The patient\u2019s symptoms, along with the history of acute biliary pancreatitis and subsequent cholecystectomy, suggest pancreatic abscess. The complex cystic fluid collection with irregular walls and septations seen on abdominal ultrasound is a typical finding in pancreatic abscess. Pancreatic pseudocysts usually develop after an episode of acute pancreatitis and have clear walls without septations. Pancreatic cancer would be less likely given the patient's age and lack of risk factors such as smoking. Acute cholangitis would not present with a pancreatic cyst."
