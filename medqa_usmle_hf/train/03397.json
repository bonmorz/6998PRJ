The patient presents with symptoms of a chest injury, including shortness of breath and chest pain, and physical examination and x-ray confirm the presence of blunt chest trauma.

Pericardiocentesis would be considered if cardiac tamponade is suspected, but there is no evidence of this from the physical examination. Abdominal ultrasonography would not be the most appropriate next step in management given the patient\u2019s presentation with chest trauma. Placement of a chest tube would be considered if a pneumothorax is identified on imaging, but CT scan is needed to confirm this before treatment."
