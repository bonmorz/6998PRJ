The patient has a history of smoking, chronic nonproductive cough, and wheezing, indicating a possible diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The arterial blood gas analysis shows a decreased Po2, which reinforces the possibility of COPD. DLCO measures the ability of the lungs to transfer gas from inhaled air to the red blood cells in pulmonary capillaries. In COPD, DLCO is decreased due to the destruction of alveolar tissue, leading to a decreased surface area for gas exchange. Therefore, we would expect to find decreased DLCO in this patient."
