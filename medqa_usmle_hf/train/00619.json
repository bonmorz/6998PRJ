Anemia is a common consequence of severe blood loss and hypovolemic shock, but it takes time for the body to produce new red blood cells. Therefore, his CBC is most likely to demonstrate a lower than normal hemoglobin and hematocrit level. Among the options, (A) Hb 5 g/dL, Hct 20% is the most likely to indicate severe anemia from significant blood loss, but it is an unlikely scenario given that the patient arrived at the hospital within minutes after the accident. (B) Hb 15 g/dL, Hct 45% is more likely to be the initial value before significant blood loss. (C) Hb 20 g/dL, Hct 60% is a high value and not typical for an adult male. (D) Hb 17 g/dL, Hct 20% is not consistent with the patient's presentation of hypovolemic shock."
