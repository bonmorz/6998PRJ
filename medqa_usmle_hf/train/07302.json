Among the options, an aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery is the most likely cause as it can compress the oculomotor nerve. Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus would cause internuclear ophthalmoplegia, which does not explain the patient\u2019s symptoms. An enlarging pituitary adenoma may cause visual field defects, but not specifically the symptoms described here. Infarction of the midbrain can cause similar symptoms, but typically involves multiple cranial nerves and may present with other neurological signs."
