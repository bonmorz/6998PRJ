The patient has significant spinal cord compression and complete erosion of the T12 vertebrae due to metastatic breast cancer.

Palliative pain management consultation, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy alone may not provide sufficient relief of symptoms and may not address the underlying cause of the spinal cord compression."
