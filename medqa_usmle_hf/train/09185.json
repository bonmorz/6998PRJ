The low pH and low HCO3- on the chemistry panel point to metabolic acidosis. A decreased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase can cause an accumulation of pyruvic acid, which can lead to lactic acidosis, a type of metabolic acidosis. Therefore, the correct answer is (B). Increased activity of alcohol dehydrogenase is seen in alcohol intoxication. Decreased activity of lactate dehydrogenase can also cause lactic acidosis. Increased flux through the electron transport chain is seen in oxidative phosphorylation, which produces ATP."
