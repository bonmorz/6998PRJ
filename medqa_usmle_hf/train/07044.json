CT of the head without contrast is the recommended initial imaging modality for acute stroke, as it can quickly identify hemorrhage and allow for consideration of thrombolytic therapy. MRI may be used to further evaluate the ischemic insult but its use is not essential in the acute setting. CT angiography may be helpful for identifying the source of the ischemic event but is not necessary for initial management. IV tPA is a thrombolytic agent used for acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, however, it is not indicated in this case as the time of onset is unclear and the patient had a similar episode 6 months ago, suggesting chronic stenosis or occlusion. Instead, the focus should be on identifying any treatable risk factors and secondary stroke prevention measures."

T1/T2 MRI of the head may provide more detailed information, but takes longer and is less readily available than a CT scan, making it less suitable for the initial evaluation.

MRI may be done later for further evaluation, but it is not the first step. CT angiography is not the first step either, as it is used to evaluate for vascular abnormalities rather than to diagnose a stroke.
