Elevated parathyroid hormone levels can be caused by low calcium levels, which can in turn be caused by phosphate retention. This is a common occurrence in patients with chronic kidney disease, as their kidneys cannot properly filter out excess phosphate. Hyperuricemia is an elevation of uric acid levels and is not related to parathyroid hormone levels. Hypercalcemia and uremia may be associated with chronic kidney disease, but they do not directly explain the elevated parathyroid levels in this patient."

Elevated parathyroid levels can be caused by several factors, but in this patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 3A chronic kidney disease, the most likely cause is phosphate retention. This is because chronic kidney disease leads to reduced excretion of phosphate, resulting in elevated levels, which can then lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Hyperuricemia is elevated levels of uric acid in the blood and is not directly related to elevated parathyroid levels. Hypercalcemia is an unlikely cause in this patient as she has no significant physical findings and her calcium levels were not mentioned. Uremia is a term used to describe the buildup of waste products in the blood due to kidney dysfunction, and it is not directly related to elevated parathyroid levels."
