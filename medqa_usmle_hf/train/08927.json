Continuing breastfeeding is the most appropriate next step in management, as breast milk provides optimal nutrition for newborns and helps promote weight gain. Serum creatinine and urea nitrogen are not indicated at this time, as there are no signs of dehydration or renal dysfunction. Adding rice cereal or cow milk-based formula is not recommended for a 4-day-old newborn who is exclusively breastfed."
