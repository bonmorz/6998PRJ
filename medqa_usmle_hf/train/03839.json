The patient is asymptomatic, and there is no significant family history or personal history of cancer, which makes it unnecessary to perform screening tests for all types of cancer. Pap smear testing is appropriate for cervical cancer screening, but HPV co-testing is not necessary for low-risk patients. Mammography and CA-125 blood testing are not indicated at this time. It is recommended that Pap smear tests be done every three years for women between the ages of 21 and 65 who have a cervix and who have not had abnormal results on previous tests. Therefore, repeating the Pap smear after 2 more years is unnecessary. Answer (A) is the most appropriate advice for the patient."
