The change in critical alert markers for high serum potassium levels has decreased the specificity of the test, as more patients are being flagged as having high levels even if they only slightly exceed the threshold. This may lead to more false positives and unnecessary testing. However, the sensitivity of the test has increased, as it is now detecting even smaller increases in potassium levels that may be clinically significant. Therefore, the answer is (C) sensitivity increased and specificity decreased. The decision to perform an electrocardiogram should be based on the patient's individual clinical presentation rather than just the laboratory value."

An electrocardiogram may be appropriate for patients with true hyperkalemia."

The change in critical alert markers from >5.5 mEq/L to >5.0 mEq/L suggests a decrease in specificity since the alert is triggered at a lower value, and more patients will be flagged. This could potentially increase sensitivity, as more patients with high potassium levels will be identified, but at the cost of increased false positives. The need for an electrocardiogram would depend on individual patient factors and should be determined by the physician in charge of the patient's care."
