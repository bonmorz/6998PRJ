The case fatality rate is 20% or 0.2. So, the annual mortality rate is 0.03 x 0.2 = 0.006 or 6 per 1,000 people. To estimate the annual mortality rate for a population of 20,000, we can multiply the mortality rate by the population and get 6 x 20 = 120 people. Therefore, the correct answer is (A)."

Therefore, the 1-year mortality rate for ischemic stroke would be 20% of 3 per 100 people, which is 0.6 per 100 people (0.2 x 3 = 0.6). To estimate the annual mortality rate for ischemic stroke per 20,000 people, we can multiply 0.6 per 100 people by 200 (since 20,000 people is 200 times larger than 100 people). This gives us 120 people (0.6 x 200 = 120), which is option (A). Therefore, the estimated annual mortality rate for ischemic stroke per 20,000 people is 120 people."
