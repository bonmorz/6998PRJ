First, we calculate k: k = 0.693/t1/2 = 0.693/6 = 0.115 per hour. Next, we calculate Vd: Vd = 0.5 L/kg x patient's weight (not given) = not enough information. Therefore, we cannot calculate exact time to reach steady state concentration. However, since 94% of steady state concentration is reached after 4 half lives, it would take approximately 24 hours (4 x 6 hours) for vancomycin to reach 94% of its plasma steady state concentration. Therefore, the correct answer is (C)."

Plugging in the numbers, we get t = (0.693 x 0.5 x patient's weight) / (0.05 x 1), which simplifies to t = 6.93 x patient's weight (in kg). For a patient of average weight (65 kg), this would be approximately 450 minutes or 7.5 hours. However, the question asks for 94%, not 100%, so we need to use the inverse of the formula: Css = (F x dose) / (CL x dosing interval), where Css is the plasma steady state concentration, and dose is the maintenance dose (1000 mg in this case). Solving for the dosing interval, we get dosing interval = (0.693 x Vd) / (CL x ln(1 - Css/F)), where ln is the natural logarithm. Since the question asks for 94% of steady state, we assume a target Css of 0.94 x 20 = 18.8 mg/L (20 is the usual steady state concentration for vancomycin). Plugging in the numbers, we get dosing interval = (0.693 x 0.5 x patient's weight) / (0.05 x ln(1 - 18.8/1000)), which simplifies to dosing interval = 22.8 x patient's weight (in kg). For a patient of average weight (65 kg), this would be approximately 23.4 hours. Therefore, the closest answer choice is C, 24 hours."

The time required to reach 94% of steady-state concentration is determined by the formula t = (0.693 x Vd) / (CL x f), where t is the time to reach 94% of steady-state concentration, Vd is the volume of distribution, CL is the clearance, and f is the fraction of the dose eliminated unchanged by the kidneys. As vancomycin is eliminated by first-order kinetics and has a half-life of 6 hours, the clearance can be calculated as CL = 0.693 x Vd / t1/2. Substituting the given values, we get CL = 0.693 x 0.5 / 6 = 0.058 L/hour. The fraction of the dose eliminated unchanged by the kidneys is about 0.8. Substituting these values in the initial formula, we get t = (0.693 x 0.5) / (0.058 x 0.8) = 24 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is (C)."
