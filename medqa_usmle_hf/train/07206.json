The two drugs mentioned in the question have different selectivity for muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Drug A is a selective muscarinic receptor agonist, which means it only binds to and activates muscarinic receptors. Muscarinic receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and have 7 transmembrane domains. Therefore, drug A likely acts by stimulating a receptor composed of 6 segments. \n\nOn the other hand, drug B is a selective nicotinic receptor agonist, which means it only binds to and activates nicotinic receptors. Nicotinic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels and have 5 subunits. Therefore, drug B likely acts by stimulating a receptor composed of 5 subunits. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Drug B acts by stimulating a receptor which is composed of 5 subunits."

Therefore, option C is incorrect. Drug B is a selective nicotinic receptor agonist, which suggests that it acts on ionotropic receptors. According to Wikipedia, nicotinic receptors are composed of 5 subunits. Therefore, option D is correct. Option A is incorrect because ionotropic receptors do not involve G proteins.

The fact that drug A is a selective muscarinic receptor agonist without any nicotinic receptor activity suggests that it acts by stimulating G protein-coupled receptors which comprise of 6 segments. Therefore, option C is incorrect. On the other hand, drug B is a selective nicotinic receptor agonist without any muscarinic receptor activity, and it has an equal affinity for both NN and NM receptors.

The question also asks about the receptors' structure and mechanism of action. Only option (D) correctly identifies that nicotinic receptors are composed of 5 subunits. Muscarinic receptors are not composed of segments. Both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors can cause conformational changes in ligand-gated ion channels, but only nicotinic receptors are located at the neuromuscular junctions of skeletal muscle."
