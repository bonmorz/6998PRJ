Hernia and gastrointestinal malignancy can also cause obstruction, but adhesions are more common. Enlarged Peyer\u2019s plaques are associated with enteric infections but not with obstruction. The abdominal plain film may show dilated loops of bowel with air-fluid levels, supporting the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction."

Gastrointestinal malignancy can cause bowel obstruction, but the acute onset and absence of weight loss make this diagnosis less likely."
