A frameshift mutation occurs when insertion or deletion of nucleotides leads to a shift in the reading frame of the codons, resulting in a nonfunctional or altered protein. Frameshift mutations can occur due to deletion, insertion or substitution of a nucleotide. The fact that the gene length appears to be shortened suggests a frameshift mutation may have occurred. This finding is consistent with a positive sweat chloride test and a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis."
