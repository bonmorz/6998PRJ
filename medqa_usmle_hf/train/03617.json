The reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 15 and 17 is characteristic of APL. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) can induce complete remission in up to 90% of patients with APL. Therefore, ATRA is the most appropriate treatment for this patient at this time. Platelet transfusions may be used to improve thrombocytopenia, which is a common complication of APL, but they do not treat the underlying disease. Rituximab and cyclophosphamide are not recommended for the treatment of APL."

The symptoms, hematoma, and low platelet count suggest a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia, which is characterized by the reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 15 and 17. All-trans retinoic acid is the treatment of choice for this type of leukemia, as it induces differentiation of the leukemic cells and improves the prognosis. Platelet transfusion may provide a temporary relief, but it does not address the underlying cause of the thrombocytopenia.
