The patient's symptoms, including fatigue and bright red blood in stool, suggest that the most likely cause is gastrointestinal bleeding. The normal colonoscopy result rules out colon cancer or other growths as causes of bleeding. The pale conjunctivae and low hemoglobin suggest anemia, which is likely caused by the bleeding. The likely underlying mechanism of this patient's bleeding is tortuous submucosal blood vessels, which can cause spontaneous bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. Thrombus or atherosclerotic narrowing of the mesenteric arteries would cause bowel ischemia and abdominal pain, which the patient did not have. Inherited factor VIII deficiency is a bleeding disorder that affects clotting, but it is unlikely to cause spontaneous gastrointestinal bleeding in an elderly patient with aortic stenosis."
