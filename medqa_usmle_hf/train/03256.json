The symptoms described suggest the patient has myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction. Among the options, only high ATPase activity is an intrinsic property of the affected muscle group. This is because myasthenia gravis is caused by antibodies that bind to and block acetylcholine receptors, leading to decreased muscle contraction and fatigue. High ATPase activity is necessary for the rapid hydrolysis of ATP to provide energy to power the cross-bridge cycle of contraction."

The patient is exhibiting signs of myasthenia gravis, which is caused by the autoimmune response to acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. The affected muscle group has a high ATPase activity due to the constant breakdown of acetylcholine, leading to muscle fatigue and weakness. Myoglobin content and ATP generation per glucose molecule are not intrinsic properties of muscle groups but rather depend on muscle fiber type and activity level. Mass per motor unit is also not relevant to myasthenia gravis."
