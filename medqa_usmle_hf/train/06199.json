The patient presents with severe pain in his right lower extremity, inability to move the leg, and an adducted, flexed, and internally rotated leg. These are classic signs of a hip dislocation, which should be confirmed with imaging. An anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis is most likely to demonstrate a small femoral head on the affected side that is posterior to the acetabulum. Option A is incorrect because a larger femoral head would suggest fracture, not dislocation. Option C is incorrect because a fracture between the greater and lesser trochanters would suggest a subtrochanteric or intertrochanteric fracture, not a dislocation. Option D is incorrect because a femoral neck fracture would present with different signs and symptoms."
