However, gestational diabetes can develop during pregnancy, which is why screening tests are necessary. The non-fasting oral glucose tolerance test with 50 g of glucose is the recommended screening test for gestational diabetes. Option B is incorrect because fasting is not necessary for the screening test. Option C is incorrect because the amount of glucose is incorrect. Option D is incorrect because HbA1c is not a recommended screening test for gestational diabetes."

In this case, ACOG recommends that all pregnant women without known diabetes should undergo a non-fasting oral glucose tolerance test with 50 g of glucose between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation to screen for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Therefore, the correct answer is (A). Option (B) is incorrect because a fasting oral glucose test with 50 g of glucose is not recommended for GDM screening. Option (C) is incorrect because a non-fasting oral glucose load test with 75 g of glucose is used for diagnostic purposes after a positive result on the initial screening test. Option (D) is incorrect because measurement of HbA1c is not recommended for GDM screening during pregnancy."

This is because fasting tests can miss women with mild gestational diabetes and the 75 g load test may be too burdensome for some women. HbA1c is not recommended for diagnosing or screening gestational diabetes, as it reflects average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months and may not accurately reflect glucose control during pregnancy."
