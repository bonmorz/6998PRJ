The most likely cause of this hemolysis is the absence of reduced glutathione, which is necessary for the detoxification of certain substances that can damage RBCs, such as drugs and toxins. Crescent-shaped erythrocytes would suggest sickle cell anemia, while inhibition of aminolevulinate dehydratase and defective ankyrin in the RBC membrane are not associated with hemolysis."

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest hemolytic anemia with increased bilirubin levels and decreased haptoglobin. The fact that he has been taking isoniazid makes drug-induced hemolysis a possible cause. Isoniazid works by inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis in mycobacteria, but it can also cause hemolysis by depleting reduced glutathione levels, making option (B) the most likely answer. Crescent-shaped erythrocytes are seen in sickle cell anemia, inhibition of aminolevulinate dehydratase is seen in lead poisoning, and defective ankyrin in the RBC membrane is seen in hereditary spherocytosis. None of these conditions are suggested in the question stem."

This is because the absence of reduced glutathione leads to a buildup of toxic compounds in red blood cells, causing their destruction and hemolysis."

The elevated bilirubin levels and low haptoglobin levels confirm this. The most likely cause of this type of anemia is the absence of reduced glutathione in erythrocytes. This can be caused by various factors such as exposure to toxins, drugs, or infections. The fact that the patient has just started on isoniazid, which is known to cause drug-induced liver injury, could also be a contributing factor."
