Combined oral contraceptives containing both a progestin and estrogen work primarily by suppressing the mid-cycle surge of luteinizing hormone (LH), thereby inhibiting follicular rupture and ovulation. Thickening of cervical mucus and suppression of ovarian folliculogenesis are also mechanisms of action, but inhibiting the rise in LH is the most important. Increase in sex-hormone binding globulin is a secondary effect of the medication."
