The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is confirmed by the enlarged prostate on rectal exam. The weak urinary stream and prolonged dribbling suggest obstructive symptoms. Terazosin is a medication used to reduce BPH-related symptoms by relaxing smooth muscles in the prostate and bladder neck. Bladder catheterization is not necessary in this case as the patient is still able to urinate on his own. Finasteride therapy is used to reduce the size of the prostate in patients with BPH but is not the first-line treatment for symptom relief. Cystoscopy is not necessary for diagnosis in this case as the patient\u2019s symptoms, physical exam findings, and postvoid ultrasound results are consistent with BPH."
