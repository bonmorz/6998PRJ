The scenario describes an acute medical condition with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) caused by massive cerebral infarction. Among the options, mechanical hyperventilation has been shown to acutely lower ICP by causing cerebral vasoconstriction, and is therefore the most appropriate choice. Mannitol infusion can also reduce ICP, but it is typically used as a second-line treatment. Glucocorticoids are not indicated in this scenario. Elevating head position may reduce ICP to some extent, but it may not be sufficient for a massive cerebral infarction."
