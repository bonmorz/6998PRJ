The patient\u2019s history of recurrent respiratory infections, productive cough with green sputum, and streaks of blood in sputum suggest bronchiectasis. The additional finding of dextrocardia suggests situs inversus, a condition where organs are mirrored from their normal position. This condition is often associated with Kartagener syndrome, which is caused by a genetic defect that affects dynein protein, leading to ciliary dysfunction. One of the manifestations of this syndrome is delayed tubal ovum transit. The other options are not associated with these symptoms."

The patient presents with recurrent respiratory infections, cough with green sputum, and streaks of blood in sputum, suggesting bronchiectasis. The presence of dextrocardia indicates Kartagener syndrome, which is associated with delayed tubal ovum transit due to the presence of immotile cilia, but not with the other options. NADPH oxidase deficiency is associated with chronic granulomatous disease. Defective interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain is associated with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Increased sweat chloride levels are associated with cystic fibrosis, but this patient\u2019s symptoms and CT findings suggest bronchiectasis and Kartagener syndrome."
