The patient's symptoms, which occur when lying down, and resolve when rolling on her side, are characteristic of aortocaval compression syndrome, which occurs when the gravid uterus compresses the inferior vena cava (IVC) when a woman lies supine. This compression can lead to decreased venous return and subsequent hypotension and bradycardia. Rolling onto one's side relieves the pressure on the IVC and restores blood flow to the heart, resolving symptoms. The other options, such as increase in plasma volume, peripheral vasodilation, and renin-angiotensin system activation, are not related to aortocaval compression syndrome."

The patient's symptoms suggest the most likely condition is supine hypotensive syndrome, which is caused by aortocaval compression. When the patient lies flat on her back, the pressure of the gravid uterus and fetus on the inferior vena cava can cause decreased venous return to the heart, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. Rolling on the side relieves this compression, allowing for improved venous return and blood pressure. The other options, such as increase in plasma volume, peripheral vasodilation, and renin-angiotensin system activation, are not associated with this condition."
