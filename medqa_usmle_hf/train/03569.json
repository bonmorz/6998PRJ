Inherited JAK2 kinase mutation can cause polycythemia vera, but additional lab tests would be needed to confirm this. Overuse of NSAIDs does not explain the polycythemia."

Inherited JAK2 kinase mutation is a possible cause of polycythemia vera, but it is not supported by the given information.

Together, these findings suggest chronic cerebral hypoxia, which is commonly seen in patients with erythrocytosis. Exogenous erythropoietin and inherited JAK2 kinase mutation are also causes of erythrocytosis but are less likely to present with the patient's symptoms. Overuse of NSAIDs may cause gastrointestinal side effects, but is not likely to cause the patient's symptoms."

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, specifically the high hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, suggest chronic cerebral hypoxia.

Exogenous erythropoietin and JAK2 kinase mutation can also cause high hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, but they are less likely given the patient's lack of use of performance enhancing drugs and family history. Overuse of NSAIDs may contribute to the patient's symptoms, but it is not the most likely cause given the other information provided."

The patient's symptoms of lethargy, headache, and nausea suggest chronic cerebral hypoxia, which can be caused by polycythemia, as evidenced by the elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.
