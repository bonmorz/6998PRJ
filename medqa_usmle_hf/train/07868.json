The infant's jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly suggest hemolytic anemia, and the positive Coombs test indicates the presence of antibodies against red blood cells. The fact that the mother has never had a blood transfusion and the previous child was born healthy suggest that this is alloimmunization, or the mother generating IgG antibodies against fetal red blood cells. Option A describes a condition called transient erythroblastopenia of childhood, which is not consistent with the infant's presentation. Option C describes a condition called ABO incompatibility, which typically presents with less severe hemolysis and jaundice.
