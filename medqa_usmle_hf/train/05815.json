Cigarette smoking and episodic fever provide no insight into the underlying mechanism, and there is no family history of inheritable diseases or malignancies. Hydroceles can result from a decreased ability to absorb lymphatic fluid, which would account for the enlargement. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) decreased lymphatic fluid absorption."
