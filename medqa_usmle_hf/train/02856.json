Embolization or radiofrequency ablation would be inappropriate for a likely hemangioma. Percutaneous liver biopsy may be considered if the lesion does not appear to be a typical hemangioma."

The patient has a well-demarcated hyperechoic hepatic lesion without a central scar, with peripheral enhancement followed by rapid clearance of contrast, which suggests a benign lesion. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to reimage in 6 months to monitor any changes. Embolization or radiofrequency ablation are considered for specific types of liver tumors but are not the first line of treatment for a benign lesion. Percutaneous liver biopsy would be considered if the lesion appears suspicious for malignancy or if it is unclear what type of lesion it is. Stopping the oral contraceptive pill is important as it may affect the liver and the lesion could be related to its use."

The hepatic lesion is likely a benign hepatic adenoma, which has a low risk of malignant transformation but can increase in size and potentially cause bleeding. Given the size and peripheral enhancement, there is a low risk of malignancy. Stopping the oral contraceptive pill is appropriate as it is a known risk factor for hepatic adenomas. However, it is not necessary to perform an invasive procedure such as embolization or radiofrequency ablation at this time. A repeat imaging in 6 months is appropriate to assess for any changes in size, shape, or enhancement of the lesion. If there is growth, more invasive measures may need to be taken."
