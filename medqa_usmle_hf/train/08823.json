The CT scan reveals significant swelling and fluid collection in the retropharyngeal space, suggestive of retropharyngeal abscess. The best initial course of treatment is incision and drainage to relieve the swelling and prevent complications. Inhaled epinephrine is not indicated in this case. Antitoxin is not helpful as retropharyngeal abscess is not caused by a specific toxin. Prednisone may be used to reduce inflammation, but incision and drainage is more critical to prevent the abscess from causing airway obstruction."
