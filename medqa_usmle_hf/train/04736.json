The patient\u2019s presenting symptoms (dark urine and flank pain) and the presence of blood and protein in the urine suggest renal involvement. The absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and normal ultrasound results make interstitial renal inflammation and renal papillary necrosis less likely. Urothelial neoplasia is also less likely given the patient\u2019s age and absence of risk factors. Therefore, renal glomerular damage, such as glomerulonephritis, is the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms."

Renal papillary necrosis is usually seen in patients with diabetes, sickle cell disease, or analgesic abuse, and does not present with acute respiratory symptoms.
