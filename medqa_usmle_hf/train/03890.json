The combination of developmental delay, seizures, protrusion of the mandible, strabismus, and a laughing facial expression suggests Angelman Syndrome, which is caused by loss of function of the maternal ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene on chromosome 15. Uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 is one of the genetic mechanisms that can cause Angelman Syndrome. The other options are not associated with the specific combination of findings seen in this patient."
