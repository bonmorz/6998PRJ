The patient presents with symptoms and signs of acute cholecystitis with gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid demonstrated on ultrasound. Abdominal paracentesis should be performed to exclude alternative diagnoses and to assess for the possibility of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Intravenous vitamin K is used to correct coagulopathy associated with liver disease, but the patient's prothrombin time is only slightly prolonged. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for acute cholecystitis, but the patient's unstable condition and fluid collection make surgery high-risk. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform abdominal paracentesis to assess for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis."

The patient presents with symptoms of acute cholecystitis with gallstones based on the history, examination and imaging results. The laboratory results show mildly elevated bilirubin and mild leukocytosis, which support the diagnosis. Abdominal paracentesis is the most appropriate next step in management to evaluate for possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, as the patient has a history of heavy alcohol use and signs of peritoneal irritation. Intravenous vitamin K and either laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy may be necessary later, but addressing the acute issue of possible bacterial peritonitis takes precedence."

Abdominal paracentesis should be performed for diagnostic purposes and to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Once a diagnosis is confirmed, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for acute cholecystitis.

The patient has symptoms and signs of acute cholecystitis, and laboratory studies indicate leukocytosis, elevated bilirubin, and elevated prothrombin time. Abdominal ultrasound shows gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid, suggesting that the patient may have a gangrenous or perforated gallbladder. Abdominal paracentesis is the most appropriate next step in management, as it can help confirm the presence of infection in the biliary tract and guide antibiotic therapy. Intravenous vitamin K is not indicated at this time, as there is no evidence of coagulopathy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy or open cholecystectomy are definitive treatments for acute cholecystitis, but should be delayed until the patient's condition has stabilized with appropriate medical management."

The patient has signs of acute cholecystitis, including tenderness and guarding in the right upper quadrant, as well as radiologic evidence of gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid.

Intravenous vitamin K is used to correct coagulation factor deficiency and is not indicated in this patient.

Therefore, it is important to perform paracentesis to assess for underlying liver disease before scheduling surgery. Open cholecystectomy is only indicated if a laparoscopic approach is not possible or if there are complications during surgery."
