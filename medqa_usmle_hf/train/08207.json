The patient is presenting with symptoms of lymphadenopathy and abnormal blood work, which suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder. The differential results suggest that the majority of cells are immature lymphocytes. The absence of CALLA/CD10 expression in flow cytometry points towards the diagnosis of precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, making option (B) the correct answer. The other options are not typically associated with trisomy 21 and are not typically CALLA/CD10 negative."

The patient has evidence of anemia and abnormal lymph nodes, along with immature cells in the peripheral smear which suggests leukemia or lymphoma.

Classic Hodgkin's lymphoma typically presents with mediastinal lymphadenopathy and is less common in children. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is precursor T-cell ALL/lymphoma."
