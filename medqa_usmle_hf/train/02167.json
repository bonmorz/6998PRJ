It is affected by several factors, including sample size, effect size, and variance. Given that both studies have identical expected treatment effect sizes and variance, the larger sample size in Study B would yield a higher power. Therefore, the grant reviewer should fund Study B. The other options, such as the surgeon's reputation or multi-center design, are not relevant to power."
