Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic that also reduces sodium reabsorption and can correct an electrolyte imbalance. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that does not correct electrolyte imbalance. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that promotes potassium excretion, increasing the risk of electrolyte imbalance.
