Diabetic kidney disease can be diagnosed by presence of albuminuria or proteinuria in the urine, which is not mentioned in any option. Option (A) mentions nephrotic range proteinuria, indicating glomerulonephritis rather than diabetic kidney disease. Option (B) mentions diabetic retinopathy, which is a common complication of diabetes but not specific to diabetic kidney disease. Option (D) mentions normal-to-large kidneys on ultrasound, which is actually a characteristic finding of diabetic kidney disease. Option (C) mentions presence of cellular casts in urinalysis, which is not specific to diabetic kidney disease but suggests glomerulonephritis or other renal pathology. Therefore, (C) makes diabetic kidney disease less likely in this patient."
