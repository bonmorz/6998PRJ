Blood and wound cultures should be collected and empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated while awaiting culture results. Vancomycin is an appropriate choice for empiric therapy of suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, which is common in hospitalized patients. Incision and drainage would be necessary if an abscess were present, but the examination findings do not suggest this. Prednisone therapy is not indicated in the management of cellulitis. Dicloxacillin is an appropriate antibiotic for streptococcal and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus infections, but it is not effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore, vancomycin is a better choice for empiric therapy."

The symptoms and signs suggest a bacterial skin infection, possibly cellulitis, and the presence of purulent drainage suggests an abscess. Blood and wound cultures help identify the responsible organism, but empirical antibiotic treatment with coverage for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is necessary. Vancomycin is effective against most strains of MRSA, while Prednisone therapy and Incision and drainage are not appropriate initial treatment options for cellulitis. Dicloxacillin is a first-line option for skin and soft tissue infections, but it does not cover MRSA."

The redness, swelling, pain, and purulent drainage suggest cellulitis or abscess, likely caused by a bacterial infection. Enlarged and tender lymph nodes also suggest an infected wound.

Prednisone is typically not indicated for acute infections.

Option D, dicloxacillin therapy, may be appropriate for mild or uncomplicated cases of cellulitis, but the presence of purulent drainage and enlarged lymph nodes suggests a more severe infection that requires broader-spectrum antibiotics."
