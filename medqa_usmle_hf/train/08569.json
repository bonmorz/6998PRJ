The presence of positive thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies suggests an autoimmune etiology, specifically Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis have an increased risk of developing thyroid lymphoma. Therefore, answer choice (D) is correct. Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer, but it is not specifically associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
