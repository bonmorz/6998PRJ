The patient has a history of multiple abnormalities affecting breathing, hearing, and eating, suggesting abnormalities in the first branchial arch, which gives rise to the maxilla, mandible, and muscles of mastication, as well as structures of the middle ear and Eustachian tube. The second branchial arch develops the stapes and styloid process, while the second branchial cleft closes to form the external auditory meatus. The third and fourth branchial pouches form the thymus, inferior parathyroid glands, and ultimobranchial bodies."
