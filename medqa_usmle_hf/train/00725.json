Bacterial overgrowth can cause both of these symptoms. The patient's history of gastrectomy with jejunal anastomosis may increase his risk of bacterial overgrowth. Neoplastic growth may cause weight loss, but it is less likely given the patient\u2019s past history of gastric cancer. Increased intestinal motility and anastomotic stricture are not typically associated with malabsorption and anemia."

The patient\u2019s symptoms of loose stools, weight loss, fatigue, and peripheral edema suggest malabsorption, which can be caused by bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine. The patient\u2019s history of partial gastrectomy increases the risk for bacterial overgrowth as well. The absence of contact with animals and travel history rule out infection-related causes. Neoplastic growth is a possibility but less likely given the history of gastric cancer with no evidence of recurrence on examination. Increased intestinal motility and anastomotic stricture are not supported by the history and examination findings."

The symptoms of loose stools, peripheral edema, weight loss, and tingling sensation in the hands and feet suggest a malabsorption syndrome. The patient's history of partial gastrectomy for gastric cancer also supports this diagnosis. Among the options, bacterial overgrowth is the most likely cause of malabsorption syndrome, as it can lead to nutrient malabsorption and vitamin deficiencies. Neoplastic growth may cause weight loss and fatigue, but it is less likely in this case as the patient's history already includes gastric cancer. Increased intestinal motility and anastomotic stricture are less likely to cause the patient's symptoms."
