The absence of suicidal ideation and neurological abnormalities also support the diagnosis of normal bereavement. Schizoaffective disorder and acute stress disorder do not fit the patient's symptoms. Major depressive disorder may be a possibility, but the context of the patient's recent loss points more towards normal bereavement."
