The description of the replication process and the involvement of three enzymes suggest that the bacteria in question are likely Escherichia coli, which is known for its ability to ferment lactose and grow on MacConkey agar. Of the three enzymes involved in elongating the DNA of the lagging strand, only DNA Polymerase I has 5'\u21923' exonuclease activity, which allows it to remove nucleotides that were incorrectly added to the growing DNA strand. This function is unique to DNA Polymerase I, while the other enzymes involved in DNA elongation (primase and DNA Polymerase III) do not possess this activity. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) excision of nucleotides with 5'\u21923' exonuclease activity."
