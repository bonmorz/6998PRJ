Pseudologia fantastica is a condition where the patient tells incredible and frequently fantastic stories about themselves. Desire for the sick-role is a behavior where a patient, consciously or unconsciously, seeks medical attention for a perceived illness to benefit from the resultant attention, sympathy, and/or financial gain. The hyperactive insula is associated with pain-related disorders, such as fibromyalgia, but not conversion disorder."
