The patient has subjective fever, malaise, and a liver palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin, which suggests liver pathology. The presence of a single cystic lesion on the right lobe of the liver, combined with a recent history of bloody diarrhea and crampy abdominal pain, suggests amoebic liver abscess. Gonorrhea and secondary syphilis are unlikely to cause a liver abscess. Alcoholic steatohepatitis may cause liver damage but is unlikely to present with a single cystic lesion."

The history of bloody diarrhea and sexual activity with multiple male partners also place the patient at risk for amoebiasis. The single cystic lesion seen on CT scan is consistent with an abscess. Gonorrhea and secondary syphilis do not typically present with liver abscesses. Alcoholic steatohepatitis would have different laboratory and imaging findings."

The cystic lesion on the liver seen on CT scan is also suggestive of an abscess. Gonorrhea and secondary syphilis are unlikely causes of the liver lesion and symptoms. Alcoholic steatohepatitis presents with different laboratory findings, such as elevated bilirubin and INR, and there is no history of alcohol abuse mentioned in the question."
