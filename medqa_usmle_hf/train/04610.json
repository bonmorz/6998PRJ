Observation can lead to complications like infection or kidney damage, and ureteral stenting is typically reserved for cases where ureterorenoscopy is not possible or unsuccessful.

The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of a distal right ureteric stone as seen on the CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which explains the severe right flank pain. Observation alone is not appropriate in cases of confirmed distal ureteric stones causing severe pain. Ureteral stenting is an option but may not be necessary for a small stone, and there may be a lack of capacity or experiences for the procedure in the emergency department. Thiazide diuretic therapy is not indicated as the stone is already in the ureter. Hence, ureterorenoscopy is the most appropriate next step in management, which has been shown to provide fast and efficient relief of symptoms in such cases."
