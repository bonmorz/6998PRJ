The symptoms suggest hypoglycemia, and the most likely cause is intrauterine hypoxia, which can cause impaired fetal growth and interrupted placental transfer of glucose. The baby is also jittery, which can be a symptom of hypoglycemia. Intraventricular hemorrhage and congenital heart disease are unlikely causes based on the presented information. Hyperinsulinism can cause hypoglycemia but is less likely in this case as the mother did not have diabetes during pregnancy."
