The elevated serum bilirubin, with direct bilirubin less than 2/3 of total bilirubin level, and absence of hemolysis or evidence of biliary obstruction suggests a primary defect in excretion. Among the four options, Dubin-Johnson syndrome causes mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia without hemolysis or liver enzyme abnormality. Type II Crigler-Najjar syndrome and Gilbert syndrome also cause unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, but with no clinical, biochemical, or histological evidence of chronic liver diseases. Type I Crigler-Najjar syndrome is the most severe form of the disease and can lead to kernicterus in infancy or early childhood."
