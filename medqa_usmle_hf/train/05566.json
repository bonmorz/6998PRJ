The symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and joint pain, along with hepatomegaly and tender nodules suggest sarcoidosis. The presence of purple, indurated lesions on the nose, nasolabial fold, and cheeks is known as lupus pernio and is associated with sarcoidosis. The biopsy findings of multinucleated giant cells with cytoplasmic inclusions and eosinophilic, needle-shaped structures arranged in a star-like pattern are consistent with sarcoidosis. Systemic lupus erythematosus and hemochromatosis do not typically present with these findings.
