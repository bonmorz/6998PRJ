Since there are no significant abnormalities found on abdominal and pelvic examination or urine pregnancy test, and the symptoms are not severe, the most appropriate next step is to offer reassurance and observation. Additional imaging such as CT scan or pelvic ultrasonography is not indicated at this time. However, if the symptoms worsen or become more frequent, further evaluation may be necessary. In the meantime, the patient can be educated about menstrual pain and non-pharmacological and pharmacological management options, including the use of combined oral contraceptive pills."

Combined oral contraceptive pill can also be an option for managing dysmenorrhea, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case as the symptoms have been occurring for 5 months and it is unclear if the patient wants to pursue hormonal contraception."
