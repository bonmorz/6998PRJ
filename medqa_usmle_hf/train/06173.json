The immediate onset of symptoms (within 15 minutes), redness of the skin and urticaria, shortness of breath and wheezing, and low blood pressure suggest an immediate or type I hypersensitivity reaction, which is commonly seen in peanut allergies. Type II hypersensitivity causes destruction of cells via antibody-mediated mechanisms, whereas serum sickness is a delayed type III hypersensitivity reaction that occurs several days after exposure to a foreign protein. Contact dermatitis is a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction that occurs upon contact with an allergen."
