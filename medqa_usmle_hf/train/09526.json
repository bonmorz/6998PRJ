Bounding pulses and warm, flushed skin suggest decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The absence of crackles and rales suggests normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). Slightly increased mixed venous oxygen saturation (SaO2) and increased cardiac output (CO) suggest compensatory mechanisms due to low blood pressure caused by decreased SVR. Therefore, the most likely relative pulmonary artery catheterization measurements in this patient would be decreased PCWP, slightly increased SaO2, increased CO, and decreased SVR."

The presence of involuntary guarding on palpation of the suprapubic region suggests a urinary tract infection, which is common in elderly women. The chosen answer, decreased PCWP, slightly increased SaO2, increased CO, and decreased SVR, is consistent with sepsis-related hypotension, where the cardiac output may be increased to compensate for low blood volume, and systemic vascular resistance may be decreased due to vasodilation."
