The patient\u2019s symptoms and physical examination suggest acromegaly, which is caused by excessive production of growth hormone. Serum IGF-1 measurement is the most appropriate test to diagnose acromegaly. An oral glucose tolerance test may also be used to confirm the diagnosis by showing reduced growth hormone suppression. Basal prolactin measurement and 24-hour urine cortisol measurement are not relevant for the diagnosis of acromegaly."
