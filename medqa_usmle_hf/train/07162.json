The structure that contributes to preventing fasting hypoglycemia by producing glucose is the intestine, specifically the small intestine. It does so through the production of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) which stimulate insulin secretion and increase glucose uptake in response to the presence of food. During periods of fasting, GLP-1 and GIP are decreased, but the intestine continues to produce glucose through gluconeogenesis. Red blood cells, skin, and adrenal cortex do not contribute to this process."
