The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and beta blockers can cause bronchoconstriction, so agents that are more selective for beta-1 receptors are preferred. Labetalol, however, is non-selective and can cause significant bronchoconstriction in patients with obstructive airway disease, so it should be avoided.
