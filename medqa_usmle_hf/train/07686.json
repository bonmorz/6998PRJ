Avidity refers to the strength of binding between an antibody and antigen, while immunoglobulin class switching involves the production of different classes of antibodies in response to different types of pathogens.

The process described is affinity maturation, which is a process that allows B cells to produce antibodies with higher affinity and specificity for a given antigen. This process takes place in germinal centers of lymphoid tissues during the primary immune response, and upon re-exposure to the same antigen, a faster and more specific response is mounted due to the presence of memory B cells. Avidity refers to the strength of binding between an antigen and all the binding sites on an antibody molecule, while immunoglobulin class switching and T cell negative selection are different processes in the immune system."
