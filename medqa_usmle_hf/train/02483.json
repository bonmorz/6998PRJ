The patient's symptoms, including abdominal distention and a palpable mass in the abdomen, suggest a possible diagnosis of appendicitis. However, the lack of hyperpolarization across the nasal epithelium when a chloride-free solution is administered suggests a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, which can present with similar symptoms. The most common cause of mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis is pulmonary infection. Therefore, the answer is (C) pulmonary infection."

The presentation suggests a possible diagnosis of intestinal obstruction, which could be caused by conditions like Crohn's disease, colon cancer, or adhesions. The test described in the question is likely referring to sweat testing, which is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis can cause intestinal obstruction and is associated with an increased risk of pulmonary infections, which are the most common cause of mortality in these patients. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) pulmonary infection."
