Option A suggests pseudomembranous colitis, which is caused by Clostridioides difficile, but the patient does not have risk factors and her symptoms are not consistent with this disease. Option B suggests Crohn's disease, which can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but the laboratory findings and symptoms in this case suggest ulcerative colitis. Option D suggests a possibility of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), but the patient\u2019s family history is not consistent with this and FAP is rare."
