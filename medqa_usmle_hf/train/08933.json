The tenderness to palpation in the anatomic snuffbox between the tendons of the abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis brevis, and extensor pollicis longus muscle is highly indicative of a scaphoid fracture. The decreased muscle strength and limited range of motion are also signs of a scaphoid fracture. Colles\u2019 fracture typically occurs with a fall on the dorsiflexed wrist, while transscaphoid perilunate dislocation presents with exquisite pain and deformity, and De Quervain's tenosynovitis typically presents with wrist pain on thumb movement."

The tenderness in the area between the tendons of the abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis brevis, and extensor pollicis longus muscles is characteristic of scaphoid fracture, which is common in young adults and can be associated with decreased muscle strength.

Colles' fracture involves a fracture of the distal radius, not the wrist, and De Quervain's tenosynovitis is a condition that affects the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist, not the scaphoid bone. Transscaphoid perilunate dislocation is a rare injury that involves dislocation of the carpus bones, and is less likely than a scaphoid fracture."
