Salmonella can cause infectious arthritis in IV drug users, but typically involves the knees, ankles, or feet. Borrelia can cause Lyme disease, which can lead to arthritis, but this patient has no other symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease. Osteoarthritis is a non-infectious form of arthritis and would not present with such acute symptoms."
