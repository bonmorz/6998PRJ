The patient's inability to remember her past job and her colleague suggests dissociative amnesia, which is commonly associated with emotional trauma or stress. The fact that she remembers recent events and her general orientation suggests that it is not a global amnesia. Pseudodementia mainly occurs in elderly patients and there is no evidence of cognitive decline or dementia-like symptoms. Dissociative identity disorder involves multiple personalities and is unrelated to this case."

The patient is unable to remember a significant event in her life, but has intact memory for recent events, ruling out transient global amnesia. The lack of other symptoms such as suicidal ideation and loss of interest in activities rules out depression or pseudodementia. The patient also denies any symptoms of dissociative identity disorder. The most likely diagnosis is dissociative amnesia, which is characterized by an inability to recall important personal information, usually involving trauma or stress."

Other options such as pseudodementia are unlikely as the patient does not show any significant cognitive decline, and transient global amnesia is unlikely as the patient does not have an acute onset of anterograde amnesia."
