The researchers reviewed medical records from a single point in time (the day of presentation) and collected data on the presence or absence of ACS and alcohol consumption. The study is not a randomized controlled trial because participants were not assigned to different treatment groups. The study is not prospective because participants were not followed over time, and it is not strictly retrospective because the researchers may have collected additional data beyond what was in the medical records."
