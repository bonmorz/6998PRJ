The patient presents with a chronic cough with recent worsening and had a low-grade fever, runny nose, and fatigue which are suggestive of a respiratory infection. The physical examination, including the chest X-ray, does not reveal any consolidation, hypervascularity or effusion, which rules out pneumonia. Since the symptoms have been present for more than a week, the next best step in management is treatment with a macrolide antibiotic such as azithromycin. Option (A) is a fluoroquinolone that can be used to treat respiratory infections but should be reserved for when macrolides fail. Option (C) combines azithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate, which is not necessary for this presentation, and option (D) is mainly effective for bacterial infections and may not be effective in this case of likely viral infection."
