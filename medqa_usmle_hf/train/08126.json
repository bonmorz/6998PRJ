The symptoms and skin biopsy suggest the patient has dermatitis herpetiformis, which is associated with celiac disease. Celiac disease often causes malabsorption and can decrease hemoglobin and increase mean corpuscular volume. The increased serum glucose level may indicate diabetes, which can coexist with celiac disease. The most likely finding related to celiac disease is increased fasting serum glucagon level, as it is often increased in cases of malabsorption. Antibodies against hemidesmosomes are associated with pemphigoid, which is not likely in this case since the Nikolsky sign is negative. Antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase are associated with type 1 diabetes, which is not likely in this case since the patient has normal insulin levels. Increased serum vasoactive intestinal polypeptide level is associated with VIPomas, which are neuroendocrine tumors that rarely cause dermatitis herpetiformis."
