The patient meets criteria for major depressive disorder, which should be treated with psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a first-line treatment for depression and would be the appropriate next step in management. Benzodiazepines like alprazolam should be avoided due to their potential for dependence and exacerbating depression symptoms. Disulfiram is used for treating alcohol dependence and is not indicated in this case. Hospitalization may be indicated if the patient is at risk of harm to self or others, but there is no evidence of this in the scenario provided."

Hospitalization is not necessary unless the patient is a danger to himself or others. Disulfiram therapy is not indicated unless the patient expresses a desire to quit drinking and stop alcohol abuse. Alprazolam may temporarily alleviate anxiety symptoms but does not address the underlying depression and may increase the risk of addiction or overdose."
