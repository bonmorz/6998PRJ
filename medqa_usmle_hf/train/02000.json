The symptoms suggest that the patient is experiencing delirium tremens (DTs) which can be caused by alcohol withdrawal. Lorazepam is often used to manage symptoms of DTs. It has a rapid onset of action and can help to reduce anxiety and agitation, as well as decrease blood pressure and heart rate. The other options (chlordiazepoxide, haloperidol, risperidone) may also be used to manage agitation, but lorazepam is the most appropriate initial choice in this scenario."
