Emergency surgery may be necessary in severe cases, but in this patient, an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the near future would be appropriate once the acute episode has resolved. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography would be indicated if there were evidence of common bile duct stones or obstruction on imaging."
