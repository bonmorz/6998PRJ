The use of ARBs as hypertensive medication is not a known cause of these symptoms. Churg-Strauss syndrome also presents with similar symptoms but negative cANCA. Microscopic polyangitis presents with a positive pANCA instead of cANCA."

The recent diagnosis of hypertension and ARBs therapy may be a coincidence rather than a cause of the presentation. Churg-Strauss syndrome and microscopic polyangitis can also present with similar symptoms, but the presence of pulmonary artery granulomatous inflammation is more strongly indicative of GPA."

The positive cANCA, hematuria, and RBC casts support this diagnosis. The patient\u2019s recent initiation of ARBs is likely not the cause of her symptoms. Churg-Strauss syndrome can present similarly but typically involves eosinophilia and does not commonly involve the pulmonary artery.
