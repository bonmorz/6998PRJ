The patient's symptoms of shooting pain with eating and wearing earrings suggest glossopharyngeal neuralgia, which affects the 9th cranial nerve.

Atypical migraine and cluster headaches do not typically cause shooting pain with eating or wearing earrings.

The patient's symptoms, including shooting pain with eating and when she wears earrings, tenderness in the right tonsillar area with postauricular tapping and the absence of jaw clicking, suggest that she may have glossopharyngeal neuralgia, which is a rare condition that causes sharp, stabbing pain in the back of the throat and ear. Atypical migraine or cluster headache may cause headache and sensitivity to light or sound, but do not typically cause shooting pain in the ear with eating or wearing earrings. Trigeminal neuralgia usually causes severe facial pain, typically on one side of the face, and is not usually associated with ear pain or tenderness in the tonsillar area."

The intermittent shooting pain during eating and wearing earrings, along with the tenderness elicited with right postauricular tapping, suggests glossopharyngeal neuralgia. The absence of jaw clicking and even molar teeth rules out temporomandibular joint disorder, which can present with similar symptoms. Migraines and cluster headaches typically present with head pain, not localized pain in the ear and tonsillar area. Trigeminal neuralgia typically presents with pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve, which includes the eyes, forehead, and jaw, but not the tonsillar area."
