The fact that the popliteal vein is not compressible on duplex ultrasonography indicates a high likelihood of DVT. Elevated coagulation factor VIII levels are associated with an increased risk of DVT. Protein S deficiency and protein C deficiency are both inherited disorders that increase the risk of DVT, but neither would cause insensitivity to activated protein C. Mutation of coagulation factor V causes activated protein C resistance, which leads to insensitivity to activated protein C and an increased risk of DVT. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) mutation of coagulation factor V."
