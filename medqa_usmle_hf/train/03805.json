Angelman syndrome is caused by genetic abnormalities on chromosome 15, which can result from a deletion on the maternal chromosome, a paternal uniparental disomy (inheritance of two copies of the chromosome from the father and none from the mother), an imprinting defect (where the maternal copy of the chromosome is not methylated), or a mutation in the UBE3A gene. Among the options, uniparental disomy best describes the mechanism for the disorder in the child."

Angelman syndrome is caused by the absence or malfunction of a gene on chromosome 15 inherited from the mother, or by a deletion in that region of the chromosome. Uniparental disomy refers to the situation where both copies of a chromosome are inherited from a single parent, which can occur in the case of Angelman syndrome. Codominance and incomplete penetrance do not apply to this situation. Variable expressivity refers to the range of symptoms displayed by individuals with the same genetic disorder, and while this is true for Angelman syndrome, it does not directly explain the genetic mechanism behind it."

Angelman syndrome is caused by loss of function of the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene on chromosome 15q11.2-q13, while the paternal copy is normally imprinted and silenced. However, in some cases, there can be uniparental disomy, where two copies of the chromosome come from one parent instead of one from each parent. This can lead to homozygosity or hemizygosity for the mutant allele, resulting in expression of the disease phenotype."

Angelman syndrome is caused by the loss or inactivation of genes on the maternal chromosome 15, while the paternal chromosome 15 is normal. This abnormality is known as uniparental disomy, where two copies of a chromosome come from one parent and no copies come from the other parent. Codominance involves both alleles being expressed equally, incomplete penetrance is when a gene mutation is present but does not always result in a particular phenotype, and variable expressivity is when the same genotype can manifest with different phenotypes. None of these terms accurately describe the mechanism for Angelman syndrome."
