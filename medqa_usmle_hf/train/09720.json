Reversible inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, such as with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), is a commonly used treatment for gout. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors and xanthine oxidase inhibitors are also used in treating gout, but NSAIDs are the first-line drug of choice for acute gout attacks. Selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 is a newer type of NSAID, but there is no evidence that it is more effective than traditional NSAIDs in treating gout."
