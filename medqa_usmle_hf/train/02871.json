The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, cough, and arthritis in ankle joints along with the presence of cutaneous nodules over the trunk and elevated levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and serum calcium levels suggest the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The CT scan findings of multiple granulomas in both lungs and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy also support this diagnosis. Treatment with steroids is a common approach for sarcoidosis. Options A and C are not associated with elevated serum calcium levels or cutaneous nodules. Tuberculosis can also present with similar lung findings but does not typically involve the joints or cause elevated serum calcium levels."
