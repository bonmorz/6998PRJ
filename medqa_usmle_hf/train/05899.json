Needle thoracostomy at the 2nd intercostal space, midclavicular line is the most appropriate next step to provide immediate relief of tension pneumothorax, which is suggested by tracheal deviation to the left and absence of breath sounds on the right, and jugular venous distention. Tube thoracostomy at the 2nd intercostal space, midclavicular line is the definitive treatment after needle thoracostomy. Tube thoracostomy at the 5th intercostal space, anterior axillary line is used to treat hemothorax or large pleural effusions."

A tube thoracostomy is a definitive treatment option, but it can wait until after needle decompression is performed. Option (A) is incorrect because the 5th intercostal space is too low for a needle thoracostomy, and there is a risk of injuring the liver or spleen. Option (C) is incorrect because tube thoracostomy is a definitive treatment and unnecessary if the patient\u2019s condition can be stabilized with needle decompression. Option (D) is incorrect because the anterior axillary line is not an appropriate location for needle thoracostomy."
