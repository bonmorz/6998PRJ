The asymmetrical pulse in the upper extremities also indicates a possible occlusion of the subclavian artery. The elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate further support the suspicion of GCA. The best next step in management is to start prednisone, a corticosteroid, at a high dose of 40-60 mg per day, as this is the standard treatment for GCA. Anti-dsDNA level is not relevant to the diagnosis of GCA. Methotrexate is used for management of rheumatoid arthritis, which has a different clinical presentation than GCA. Temporal artery biopsy is a confirmatory test for GCA, but treatment with corticosteroids should be initiated before the biopsy is performed to avoid delay in treatment."

Anti-dsDNA level can also help with diagnosis, but it is not the best next step in management.
