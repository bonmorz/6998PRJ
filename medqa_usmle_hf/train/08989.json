Lowering the threshold for ELISA absorbance cutoff value would increase the number of false positives, thus decreasing specificity and increasing sensitivity. This means that there will be more individuals who test positive but are not actually infected (increased false positives) and more individuals who are infected that test positive (increased true positives). However, this decision would also increase the number of true negatives (people who test negative and are not infected), leading to an overall increase in negative predictive value. So, the most likely outcome is increased negative predictive value."
