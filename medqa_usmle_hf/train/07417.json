Osgood-Schlatter disease is characterized by pain and tenderness below the patella, often in young athletes, due to repetitive stress on the growth plate. The pain is aggravated by jumping or climbing stairs, which matches the patient\u2019s symptoms. Meniscal tear, patellofemoral syndrome, and prepatellar bursitis would typically have different symptoms and physical examination findings."
