Antagonist at bradykinin receptor can help to alleviate the symptoms by blocking the bradykinin-mediated response during anaphylaxis. Antagonist at histamine receptor may be used in another type of allergic reaction, but not in this case. Agonist at androgen receptor and agonist at glucocorticoid receptor do not have a role in treating an allergic reaction."
