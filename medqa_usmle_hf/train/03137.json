The filtration fraction is the fraction of plasma that is filtered by the glomeruli. In this case, assuming a normal filtration fraction of 20%, the renal plasma flow rate can be estimated as 0.01 mg/mL \u00f7 0.2 = 0.05 mL/min. The filtered load of PAH can then be calculated as 0.05 mL/min \u00d7 1.66 mL/min = 0.083 mg/min. Since urea is freely filtered by the glomeruli, the filtered load of urea can be estimated as the product of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the plasma concentration of urea. The GFR can be estimated as the product of the renal plasma flow rate (0.05 mL/min) and the filtration fraction (20%), which equals 0.01 mL/min. Therefore, the filtered load of urea can be calculated as 0.01 mL/min \u00d7 0.2 mg/mL = 0.002 mg/min, or 25 mg/min for a 1 L urine collection over 10 hours. The closest answer is (A), 25 mg/min."

Assuming a normal filtration fraction of 20%, we can calculate the estimated GFR: 1.66 mL/min urine flow rate / 0.2 urine urea concentration = 8.3 mL/min = 8.3 L/day GFR. Therefore, the renal plasma flow is 8.3 L/day * 0.2 filtration fraction = 1.66 L/day. Since the PAH plasma concentration is 0.01 mg/mL and the urine PAH concentration is 3.74 mg/mL, the PAH clearance is 1.66 mL/min * (3.74 mg/mL / 0.01 mg/mL) = 620.44 mL/min. Since urea is freely filtered and not reabsorbed nor secreted, the filtered load of urea is the product of the GFR and the serum urea concentration: 8.3 L/day * 0.2 mg/mL = 1.66 g/day = 25 mg/min. Therefore, the correct answer is (A)."

The formula for filtered load is: filtered load = GFR x plasma concentration of the substance. In this case, the PAH clearance is used to estimate the GFR, which is 100 mL/min. The filtered load of PAH is then 0.01 mg/mL x 100 mL/min = 1 mg/min. Assuming a filtration fraction of 20%, the renal plasma flow (RPF) can be estimated as 5 times the PAH clearance, or 500 mL/min. Therefore, the renal blood flow (RBF) can be estimated as RPF/0.8 = 625 mL/min. Using the same formula, the filtered load of urea can be estimated as 0.2 mg/mL x 625 mL/min = 125 mg/min. However, the question asks for the \"best estimate\" and provides only multiple choice options that are far apart from each other. The closest answer would be (A) 25 mg/min, which is the filtered load of urea for a GFR of 25 mL/min, which is clearly too low for a healthy young man."

To estimate the filtered load of urea, we need to know the serum concentration of urea, which is given as 0.2 mg/mL.

Filtration fraction = GFR/renal plasma flow (which is roughly 600 mL/min in a healthy person) = 0.166.

We do not have the GFR, but we can estimate it from the PAH clearance, which is a good indicator of renal plasma flow (RPF). Assuming a normal filtration fraction of 20%, RPF = GFR/0.2. PAH is cleared entirely from the renal circulation, so the clearance rate of PAH equals RPF. PAH clearance is 0.01 mg/min/mL x urine output (1.66 mL/min) = 0.0166 mg/min. Therefore, RPF = 0.0166 / 0.01 = 1.66 mL/min. GFR = RPF / (1 - hematocrit), assuming a hematocrit of 45% gives: GFR = RPF / 0.55 = 1.66 / 0.55 = 3.02 mL/min. The filtered load of urea is 3.02 mL/min x 0.2 mg/mL = 0.604 mg/min, which is closest to answer (A) 25 mg/min when converted to mg/min."

This gives us an estimated GFR of 0.2 x 2.66 mL/min = 0.532 mL/min.
