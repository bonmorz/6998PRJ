Factitious disorder is a mental illness where a person creates or exaggerates symptoms in order to gain attention or sympathy. In this case, the patient has a history of multiple hospital admissions with unexplained symptoms. Normal c-peptide levels would confirm a diagnosis of factitious disorder because it indicates that the patient is not actually hypoglycemic but rather intentionally causing his symptoms. The other options do not have a direct association with factitious disorder."

Factitious disorder is a mental illness in which a person acts as if he or she has a physical or mental illness when he or she is not really sick. In this case, the patient has a long history of admissions for vague symptoms that could not be explained. Increased anion gap, the presence of norepinephrine and vanillylmandelic acid in the urine are not diagnostic for factitious disorder. Normal c-peptide levels, which are a marker of insulin secretion, would help rule out hypoglycemia caused by excess insulin administration, which is a common way for patients with factitious disorder to induce symptoms."

Factitious disorder refers to intentionally producing or faking physical or psychological symptoms in order to deceive others, and multivitamins could be used as a way to create abnormal test results. Among the options, normal c-peptide levels are an indicator that the low blood sugar is not caused by external insulin use and is more likely to be a result of factitious disorder. Increased anion gap is a nonspecific sign that can be seen in many conditions, while increased c-peptide levels suggest the presence of insulin in the body.
