The next step would be to test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) and anti-IgM hepatitis B core antibody (Anti-IgM Hbc) to determine if the hepatitis is caused by a hepatitis B virus infection. Options A and B may be done later in the management of the patient, but the initial step is to determine the cause of the acute hepatitis. Reassurance and counseling is not appropriate in this case as the patient needs further investigation and management."
