The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, dark urine, and difficulty raising arms suggest a possible adverse effect of primidone, which can cause liver toxicity. Topiramate is also used to treat tremors, but does not have the same adverse effects. Propranolol is used to treat essential tremors but does not cause liver toxicity. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine and not typically used for tremor."
