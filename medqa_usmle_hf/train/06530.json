The fact that Kegel exercises and a continence pessary did not alleviate the symptoms suggest the need for surgical intervention. The urethral sling is a surgical procedure that has been proven to be highly effective in treating stress urinary incontinence. Topical vaginal estrogen could be considered if there were symptoms of atrophic vaginitis. Tighter glycemic control is important in the management of diabetes but is not likely to improve urinary incontinence symptoms. Biofeedback may be used as an adjunct to behavioral and pelvic floor physical therapy but is not as effective as urethral sling surgery."
