The description of the lesion, particularly the presence of abundant, granular, mildly eosinophilic cells with grooved nuclei with indented nuclear membranes, and the immunohistochemical staining positive for S100 and CD1a, suggest a diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. This condition arises from the abnormal proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of dendritic cell. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) dendritic cells."
