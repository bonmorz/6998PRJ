The symptoms of pain and swelling near the lacrimal duct, with expressible pus when pressure is applied, suggest dacryocystitis.

The recent orbital fracture may be a contributing factor, but is not the primary cause of the symptoms."

The presence of expressible pus and pain/swelling near the lacrimal duct support this diagnosis. Hordeolum is also known as a stye and is usually seen on the eyelid margin rather than near the lacrimal duct. Orbital cellulitis and periorbital cellulitis are both infections of the eye and surrounding tissues, but they typically present with more severe symptoms such as fever, proptosis, and restricted eye movements. The lack of these symptoms in this patient makes those options less likely."
