A loud holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border is common with ventricular septal defect and is graded IV based on the intensity of the murmur. The fact that the pediatrician reassures the parents that the infant will be monitored but most likely will not require surgical intervention also supports the diagnosis of ventricular septal defect, which often closes on its own. Atrial septal defect may also present with a murmur, but it is usually mid-systolic and not as intense. Tetralogy of Fallot and patent ductus arteriosus would likely present with different clinical features and murmurs."

VSD is a congenital heart defect that involves an abnormal opening in the ventricular septum. Surgical intervention is not always necessary for VSD, as it can sometimes close on its own or may not cause significant symptoms. Atrial septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus also involve abnormal openings in the heart, but the location and characteristics of the murmur suggest VSD. Tetralogy of Fallot involves a combination of several heart defects and typically presents with different symptoms than those described for this patient."
