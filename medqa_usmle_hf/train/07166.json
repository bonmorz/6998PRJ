Focused ultrasound shows free fluid in the left upper quadrant, indicating internal bleeding. Based on this, we can determine that the patient\u2019s cardiac output will be decreased, with elevated systemic vascular resistance as the body attempts to compensate for the decreased blood volume. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and central venous pressure may be decreased due to the hypovolemia. Therefore, the correct answer is (B), with decreased cardiac output, increased systemic vascular resistance, and decreased central venous pressure."

In this scenario, the patient has sustained an abdominal injury, and the free fluid in the left upper quadrant indicates internal bleeding. The hemodynamic changes that most likely follow an acute blood loss are reduced cardiac output, decreased systemic vascular resistance, and decreased central venous pressure. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is usually normal or low. Therefore, the correct answer is (B): \u2193 \u2193 \u2191 \u2193. The decreased cardiac output results from decreased blood volume due to internal bleeding. The decreased systemic vascular resistance occurs due to vasodilation in response to shock. The decreased central venous pressure occurs due to the reduced blood volume. However, the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is normal or low because there is no fluid overload in the lungs."
