The patient presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea with blood, which are suggestive of acute mesenteric ischemia. Elevated blood pressure, irregular pulse, and mild periumbilical tenderness are also consistent with this diagnosis. Acute pancreatitis would have more pronounced epigastric pain and tends to worsen with alcohol and fatty meals. Crohn's disease usually presents with chronic, waxing and waning abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Diverticular disease usually presents with left-sided lower abdominal pain and tenderness."

While Crohn's disease and diverticular disease can also cause abdominal pain and diarrhea, the sudden onset and severity of symptoms in this case point towards acute mesenteric ischemia. Acute pancreatitis usually presents with severe epigastric pain that radiates to the back and is associated with elevated pancreatic enzymes."
