The patient\u2019s lack of sexual activity and nulliparity indicate a lower risk for breast cancer compared to her friend who was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. However, the unilateral, poorly defined, and irregular mass with no axillary lymphadenopathy is concerning for inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), which has a worse prognosis compared to other types of breast cancer. Furthermore, IBC can present bilaterally, which is not characteristic of invasive ductal carcinoma. Mammograms may not always detect IBC, which can present as diffuse skin thickening or erythema, rather than a discrete spiculated mass."

The patient\u2019s lack of sexual activity suggests that the most likely type of breast cancer is lobular carcinoma, which is known to present bilaterally. The patient\u2019s family history and unintentional weight loss indicate that the tumor may have a worse prognosis. Mammograms are often less useful in detecting lobular carcinoma because it does not usually form a discrete mass, so option (D) is incorrect. There is no information given in the patient\u2019s presentation to support a higher prevalence (option C)."

The patient\u2019s characteristics (no children, never sexually active, family history of breast cancer) suggest a higher risk for developing triple-negative breast cancer. The fact that the mass is minimally palpable with poorly defined margins implies a lack of structure or cells adhering to each other, which suggests invasive lobular carcinoma. This type of cancer can present bilaterally and have a worse prognosis compared to invasive ductal carcinoma, which is what the patient\u2019s friend was diagnosed with. Option (B) is the correct answer, as the others are not associated with the type of cancer described."

The patient\u2019s lack of sexual activity and nulliparous status put her at higher risk for lobular carcinoma, which can present bilaterally. The minimally palpable mass with irregular, poorly defined margins suggests an infiltrative lobular carcinoma (ILC), which has a worse prognosis than the more common invasive ductal carcinoma.

However, the family history and presence of a palpable mass with irregular margins suggest a higher likelihood of malignancy. The fact that the mass is movable and there is no axillary lymphadenopathy is somewhat reassuring. The answer to the question is (B), as the patient\u2019s lack of sexual activity and never having been pregnant suggests a lower likelihood of developing invasive ductal carcinoma, which is typically the most common type of breast cancer. However, the fact that the mass is palpable and has irregular margins suggests a higher likelihood of invasive lobular carcinoma, which is less common but tends to present bilaterally and have poorly defined margins. This suggests that the patient may have a different type of breast cancer than her friend and highlights the importance of individualized risk assessment and screening in breast cancer."
