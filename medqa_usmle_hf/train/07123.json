The positive anti-intrinsic factor antibodies test supports this diagnosis. The peripheral blood smear shows macrocytic (moderately enlarged) and hypochromic (pale) red blood cells, which are characteristic of pernicious anemia. Hypothyroidism can cause fatigue and weakness, but it is not associated with macrocytic anemia. Folate deficiency can cause macrocytic anemia, but it would not explain the positive anti-intrinsic factor antibodies test. Alcoholism can also cause macrocytic anemia, but again, it would not explain the positive anti-intrinsic factor antibodies test."

Folate deficiency can also cause macrocytic anemia, but the presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies makes pernicious anemia a more likely diagnosis. Hypothyroidism may cause neurologic symptoms and weight gain, but it is less likely to cause macrocytic anemia.
