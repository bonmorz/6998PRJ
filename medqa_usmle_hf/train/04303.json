The combination of hemoptysis, hematuria, and saddle nose deformity suggests Wegener granulomatosis, which is characterized by autoimmune small vessel vasculitis. Corticosteroids are a standard treatment for autoimmune vasculitis. Smoking cessation and discontinuation of ibuprofen are important, but not the primary interventions for this condition. IV immunoglobulin may be used in certain autoimmune disorders, but is not typically the first-line treatment for Wegener granulomatosis."
