The symptoms, including the left shoulder pain and elevated hemidiaphragm, suggest that the nerve affected is the phrenic nerve, which innervates the diaphragm. The 3-cm mass in the chest is most likely causing compression of the nerve. Among the options, only the fibrous pericardium is in close proximity to the phrenic nerve."

The symptoms, including left shoulder pain and decreased breath sounds on the left side, suggest injury to the phrenic nerve, which innervates the diaphragm. The x-ray showing a perihilar mass and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm suggest that the nerve injury is caused by the mass compressing the nerve. The fibrous pericardium also shares the same nerve supply with the diaphragm, which is the phrenic nerve. Therefore, the most likely answer is (A) fibrous pericardium. The other options do not share the same nerve supply with the diaphragm."
