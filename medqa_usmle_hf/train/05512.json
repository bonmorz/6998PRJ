There were a total of 16 family members who attended the family reunion and were at risk for contracting the disease. We can see from the graph that 6 individuals had the disease in May, which is the month being asked about. Therefore, the attack rate among the individuals at risk in May would be 6/16, or simplified to 3/8. However, since the question asks for the attack rate among individuals at risk in May relative to the total number of individuals at risk, we must exclude the individual who was already sick in April. Therefore, the correct answer is 6/15."
