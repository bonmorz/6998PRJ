The patient is vomiting blood and has a history of alcoholism and cirrhosis, which indicates a high risk of esophageal varices. Endotracheal intubation is the most appropriate initial step to protect the airway in case he continues to vomit and aspirate blood. Upper endoscopy is the definitive diagnostic test to evaluate the cause of the bleeding, but it can be performed after the patient is stabilized. Administering octreotide can help reduce portal pressure and bleeding, but it is not the most appropriate initial step in this scenario. Placing a nasogastric tube can help with gastric decompression, but it is not the most urgent intervention in this situation."
