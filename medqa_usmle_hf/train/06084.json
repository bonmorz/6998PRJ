The symptoms, especially the projectile vomiting, suggest hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS), which is more likely in a male infant and can be caused by erythromycin use. The palpable mass is the hypertrophied pylorus. Sunken fontanelles and dry mucous membranes are signs of dehydration, which is common in HPS. Milk-protein allergy and intussusception can also cause vomiting but not usually projectile vomiting. Midgut volvulus may cause bilious vomiting and is less likely in a 5-week-old infant."
