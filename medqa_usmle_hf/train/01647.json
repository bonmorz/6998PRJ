Sickle cell anemia causes an increased susceptibility to infections with certain organisms, particularly encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae type B, and Neisseria meningitidis.

Hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder, and T-cell deficiency can also increase susceptibility to infections but it is not specifically related to encapsulated bacteria. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) C3 complement deficiency."
