While an echocardiogram, bronchoscopy, or CT scan may be useful later in the management of the patient, a chest X-ray will provide a quick and important initial evaluation. Additionally, the difficulty in obtaining intravenous access suggests the patient may be in shock, so management of hemodynamic instability may also be necessary."
