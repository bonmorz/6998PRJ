The patient exhibits symptoms of nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. The decreased complement C4 suggests membranous nephropathy, which is associated with subepithelial deposits on renal biopsy. Options B and C are associated with different types of glomerulonephritis, which are not indicated by the symptoms or lab results. Option D is associated with IgA nephropathy, which typically presents with asymptomatic hematuria and mild proteinuria, not nephrotic syndrome."
