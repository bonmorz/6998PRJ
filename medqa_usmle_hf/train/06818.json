The fact that the drug is able to stimulate receptors in the presence of low hormone levels and inhibit the same receptors in the presence of high hormone levels suggests that it is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). The most commonly prescribed SERM for fertility is Clomiphene citrate, which can cause visual disturbances as an adverse effect.

Adverse effects of clomiphene citrate include visual disturbances, such as blurry vision and color vision changes.
