The symptoms and blood smear findings are consistent with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and TdT and CALLA are markers for ALL. CD 19 is also a marker for B-cell ALL, which is the most common subtype of ALL in children. Therefore, CD 19 is the most likely choice among the options given. CD 8 and CD 7 are markers for T-cell ALL, which is less common in children. CD 5 is a marker for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and not typically seen in children."
