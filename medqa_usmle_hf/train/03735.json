The patient has a prolonged QT interval and taking flecainide, which can increase the risk of arrhythmia during exercise stress testing. However, none of the options suggest this. False-positive ST-segment depression can be seen in patients with left bundle branch block, which the patient does not have. Prolonged QRS complex is often seen in patients with bundle branch block or ventricular hypertrophy, which can be possible in this patient. Decreased maximal heart rate is not a common ECG change seen on stress testing. Therefore, option (C) is the most likely answer."

Flecainide is an antiarrhythmic drug, so stopping it may increase the likelihood of cardiac stress testing-induced arrhythmia. Prolonged QTc interval may lead to arrhythmia and sudden death but this patient's corrected QT interval is within the reference range. False-positive ST-segment depression happens in patients with conditions that can mimic ischemia, such as left ventricular hypertrophy or bundle branch block. Decreased maximal heart rate may occur in patients with restrictive lung disease or heart failure but there is no evidence of these conditions in this patient. Prolonged QRS complex may indicate a block or abnormal conduction pathway, which can be indicative of underlying heart disease and may be seen on cardiac stress testing."
