The patient's symptoms suggest Cauda equina syndrome, which is characterized by lower back pain, radiating leg pain, and decreased sensation in the perineum. The reduced strength and reflexes in the right lower extremity are also consistent with this diagnosis. Central cord syndrome and Brown-sequard syndrome usually result from spinal cord injury, while anterior spinal cord syndrome involves loss of motor function more than sensory function. Anastrozole, the patient's medication, is unlikely to be related to her symptoms."

The symptoms, including the sharp back pain radiating to the right leg, decreased sensation, and trouble urinating, suggest cauda equina syndrome. The neurologic exam findings also support this diagnosis, with weakness in the right lower extremity and reduced anal sphincter squeeze tone. Central cord syndrome and Brown-sequard syndrome typically present with different symptoms and exam findings. Anterior spinal cord syndrome presents with weakness and sensory loss below the level of the lesion, but typically does not involve the bowel or bladder."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a lower back problem, and the decreased sensation around the buttocks and inner thighs suggest that the problem may involve the cauda equina. The reduced strength and reflexes in the right lower extremity, as well as the reduced squeeze tone, are consistent with cauda equina syndrome. Central cord syndrome is typically seen in older patients with cervical spinal cord injury, and Brown-sequard syndrome involves motor and sensory deficits on opposite sides of the body.
