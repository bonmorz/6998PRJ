The major source of energy during fasting is the breakdown of glycogen in the liver and release of glucose into the blood. The kidneys also play a role in maintaining glucose homeostasis during fasting by producing glucose through gluconeogenesis. Therefore, the correct answer is liver and kidney (B). Muscle (A and C) can also provide energy during fasting through the breakdown of glycogen, but it is not the major source of energy needed for the brain to function."

The liver and kidney are responsible for gluconeogenesis, the process of creating glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, in order to maintain blood glucose levels for energy. This is the major source of energy for the brain during fasting or periods of low carbohydrate intake. The muscle can also participate in gluconeogenesis, but it is not as significant as the liver and kidney. Option (A) is incorrect because the kidney is not included, and option (C) is redundant. Option (D) is incorrect because while muscle can produce energy through glycogenolysis, it is not the major source of energy for the brain during fasting or periods of low carbohydrate intake."

The liver is responsible for maintaining blood glucose levels through gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, while the kidney plays a role in maintaining acid-base balance and electrolyte concentration, which are crucial for maintaining neurological function. Therefore, the correct answer is liver and kidney (B). The option liver and muscle (A) is partially correct, as muscle can also produce glucose through glycogenolysis, but it is not the major source of energy for cognition. Option C includes all three organs, but does not accurately reflect the major sources of energy for cognition. Option D is incorrect as muscle alone is not capable of producing enough energy for cognitive function."
