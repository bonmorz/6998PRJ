The fact that her father also had short stature and late puberty suggests a familial pattern. The lab findings are expected to be normal since this is likely a case of constitutional growth delay, a temporary delay in growth and puberty without any underlying medical conditions. Option A describes primary ovarian failure, Option B describes hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal dysfunction, and Option D describes precocious puberty."

However, breast development is at stage 2, which is normal for Tanner stage 2. This means that FSH, LH, estrogen, and GnRH levels are likely to be normal, as shown in option (C). Options (A) and (B) indicate decreased hormone levels and option (D) shows elevated hormone levels, which are inconsistent with the patient\u2019s clinical presentation."

The absence of pubic and axillary hair and Tanner stage 2 breast development also support delayed puberty. Laboratory findings in a patient with delayed puberty should show normal levels of FSH, LH, and estrogen, and normal responses to GnRH stimulation, so option (C) is the correct answer. Other options indicate abnormalities in hormone levels, which are not consistent with the presentation."
