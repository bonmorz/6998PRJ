Among the options, liraglutide is the most appropriate antidiabetic drug to address both this patient's glucose control and weight. It is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist which helps to produce insulin, suppresses the production of glucagon (which increases glucose production), and slows down gastric emptying, which can lead to weight loss. Miglitol and Nateglinide are not effective in promoting weight loss, and Rosiglitazone has been linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and should only be used with caution."
