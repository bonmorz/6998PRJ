Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic and not related to the patient's symptoms. Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker and not indicated for treating transplant rejection.

Treatment with intravenous steroids would help to address this inflammation and rejection, and is therefore the most appropriate next step in management. Nephrectomy would not be appropriate as the patient's previous transplant was only 2 months ago. Adding ceftriaxone or diltiazem would not address the underlying renal dysfunction."
