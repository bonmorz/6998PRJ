A single contrast esophagram or denture fitting assessment would not be the appropriate next step, as they would not provide information on her immune status. A single contrast esophagram with water soluble iodine contrast may be used to diagnose esophageal disorders, but this is not the most likely diagnosis based on her symptoms."

Option B is not a priority at this time as denture fitting is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms."
