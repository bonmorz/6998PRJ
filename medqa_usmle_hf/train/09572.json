The presentation of abdominal pain starting after eating and persisting for 6 hours, accompanied by vomiting and tenderness in the right upper quadrant, suggests gallstone disease. The inability to visualize any gallstones on ultrasound may be due to the patient's body habitus. Acalculous cholecystitis would not have gallstones present, while cancer of the biliary tree and pancreatic inflammation would have abnormal liver function tests, amylase, and lipase levels."

Cancer of the biliary tree or pancreatic inflammation are less likely given the normal liver function tests, amylase, and lipase levels."

The patient's presentation of pain shortly after eating and tenderness in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen suggest gallstone disease, which is the most likely cause. Acalculous cholecystitis may also be a possibility, but this is less common than gallstones. Cancer of the biliary tree is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of jaundice or abnormal liver function tests. Pancreatic inflammation is also less likely, given the normal amylase and lipase levels. Though the ultrasound was not able to visualize any gallstones, this could be due to the patient's body habitus, and an alternate imaging modality may be needed."
