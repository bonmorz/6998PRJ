The patient denies the possibility of pregnancy, but a serum hCG should be obtained to rule out ectopic pregnancy or other gynecological conditions. Surgical consultation may be necessary depending on the results of the serum hCG or other diagnostic tests. Abdominal CT scan is less likely to provide useful information in this case. Admission and observation should be considered if the patient\u2019s pain is severe or if there is concern for a surgical emergency, but the serum hCG is a more appropriate initial step."
