The patient is presenting with symptoms of confusion, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, along with skin discoloration and cardiac findings. These are suggestive of carcinoid syndrome, which is caused by a rare type of tumor called a carcinoid tumor. A serum 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) level can confirm the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome as it is a byproduct of the breakdown of serotonin that is produced by the tumor. Stool culture is not helpful in this case as there is no suggestion of an infectious cause of the symptoms. ANA titer and CT scan of the abdomen are unlikely to provide any diagnostic information related to carcinoid syndrome."

The symptoms and physical exam suggest systemic sclerosis, and the thickening of the right ventricular endocardium suggests cardiac involvement. A possible cause for the patient's symptoms is carcinoid syndrome, which can be tested with serum 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels. Stool culture is not indicated since the patient's diarrhea is most likely a symptom of her underlying condition rather than an infectious process. ANA titer and CT scan of the abdomen may also be helpful in the evaluation of systemic sclerosis, but the patient's symptoms and physical exam point more towards carcinoid syndrome."
