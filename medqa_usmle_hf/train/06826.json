The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest acute pancreatitis, which is often caused by heavy alcohol consumption. The most appropriate next step in management would be crystalloid fluid infusion to replace fluid losses and prevent dehydration. Calcium gluconate therapy is used for hyperkalemia, and fomepizole therapy is used for ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning, neither of which are indicated in this case. Laparotomy may be necessary in severe cases of pancreatitis, but it is not the initial step in management."

The lipase level is significantly elevated, and the leukocyte count is also elevated. The low potassium level (3.1 mEq/L) needs immediate attention because hypokalemia can cause cardiac arrhythmias. The next step in management should be a crystalloid fluid infusion to correct hypovolemia and electrolyte imbalances. Calcium gluconate therapy is used in hyperkalemia, not hypokalemia. Fomepizole therapy is used in toxic alcohol ingestion, which is not suggested in this case. Laparotomy is not indicated in this emergency management scenario."
