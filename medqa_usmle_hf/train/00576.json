Pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood clot blocks a pulmonary artery, reducing blood flow to the affected area of the lung.

As a result, the oxygen content in the trachea would resemble the oxygen content in the affected alveoli. In contrast, emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis affect the alveoli, but not the trachea. Foreign body obstruction distal to the trachea would affect air flow, but not gas exchange, and therefore would not impact oxygen content in the trachea."
