The absence of verbal or physical aggression suggests that the diagnosis is not Intermittent explosive disorder. The absence of attention deficit and hyperactivity suggests that the diagnosis is not Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, hyperactivity-impulsivity type. The behavior of the patient suggests that the most likely diagnosis is Conduct disorder."

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may include impulsivity and hyperactivity, but it does not typically lead to aggressive behavior towards others."

Oppositional defiant disorder may appear similar but it lacks the more serious aggressive behavior displayed by the boy, and there is no evidence of the other criteria. Intermittent explosive disorder is characterized by sudden outbursts of verbal or physical aggression and there is no evidence of this in the case. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, hyperactivity-impulsivity type, may exhibit some similar behaviors but does not include the severity of aggressive or rule-breaking behavior as seen in conduct disorder."
