The symptoms of depression, weight gain, and fatigue suggest the patient was prescribed a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), which is used to treat depression. Hence, the correct answer is option (B), which states that the drug non-selectively inhibits monoamine oxidase A and B. MAOIs prevent the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, resulting in an increase in their levels in the brain, which can alleviate depression symptoms."
