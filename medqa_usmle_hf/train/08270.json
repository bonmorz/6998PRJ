Borderline personality disorder may cause emotional instability but not necessarily neurological symptoms. Ischemic stroke and malingering are unlikely given the lack of physical abnormalities and the sudden onset of symptoms."

Borderline personality disorder is a long-term mental illness characterized by unstable moods, behavior, and relationships. Ischemic stroke would have abnormal imaging findings and physical exam findings beyond weakness, and malingering is deliberate faking or exaggeration of symptoms for personal gain."
