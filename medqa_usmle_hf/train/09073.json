The drug that prevents IL-2 transcription is most likely a type of immunosuppressive drug called a calcineurin inhibitor. The main toxicity associated with this class of drugs is nephrotoxicity, or damage to the kidneys. This is why patients must be monitored closely for changes in kidney function while taking these drugs. Hyperglycemia is a possible side effect of steroids, which may also be used to treat this patient\u2019s condition. Osteoporosis and pancytopenia are not commonly associated with calcineurin inhibitors."

Corticosteroids can cause all of the listed toxicities, but calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus are known for their nephrotoxicity. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Nephrotoxicity."
