There are several possible causes of joint pain, but given the patient's sexual history and symptoms of urethritis, the most likely diagnosis is an STD-related arthritis, specifically gonococcal arthritis. Treatment should include antibiotics, and given the possibility of drug-resistant strains, a combination of azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin is recommended. However, the joint pain also warrants arthrocentesis to rule out septic arthritis, which would require urgent treatment.
