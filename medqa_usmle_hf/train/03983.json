The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest she has developed cutaneous necrosis, which is a side effect of anticoagulants, especially warfarin. Option (B) fits this description, as deficiencies in natural anticoagulants such as protein C or S can predispose individuals to hypercoagulability and thrombosis. None of the other options are directly related to anticoagulant use or clotting disorders."
