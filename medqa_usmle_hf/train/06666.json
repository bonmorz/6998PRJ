The patient\u2019s symptoms and medical history suggest that he may have a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke, possibly related to carotid artery disease. Carotid duplex ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step in management to evaluate for carotid artery stenosis or occlusion as a potential cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms. Echocardiography may be needed to evaluate for cardiac sources of emboli, but carotid duplex ultrasonography is a more appropriate initial test. Fluorescein angiography is used to evaluate retinal blood flow and is not appropriate for this patient\u2019s presentation. Reassurance and follow-up is not appropriate given the potential serious nature of the patient\u2019s symptoms."
