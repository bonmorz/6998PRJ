The patient has several concerning symptoms, including chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, and cervical lymphadenopathy, as well as imaging findings consistent with a superior mediastinal mass. These symptoms raise suspicion for malignancy, and therefore an excisional biopsy is most appropriate to confirm the diagnosis. Leukocyte count and sputum polymerase chain reaction test are unlikely to provide a definitive diagnosis in this case, while a CT scan may provide further information on the extent of the mass but cannot confirm the diagnosis."
