The symptoms of heavy vaginal bleeding, bleeding gums, and prolonged bleeding after tonsillectomy suggest a bleeding disorder. The platelet count is low, but the bleeding time and PT/PTT are normal, which rules out vWD and Aspirin/NSAID use. The inability of platelets to aggregate to ristocetin suggests a deficiency in von Willebrand factor, which is present in vWD but not in Glanzmann thrombasthenia. However, the presence of enlarged platelets and increased megakaryocytes is characteristic of Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that presents with a deficiency in glycoprotein Ib/IX/V complex, resulting in impaired platelet adhesion."

The girl has a low platelet count, prolonged bleeding time, and platelets that do not aggregate to ristocetin, which suggests platelet dysfunction. Among the given options, only Bernard-Soulier syndrome is a disorder of platelet dysfunction characterized by enlarged platelets and absent or reduced platelet aggregation to ristocetin. This syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a deficiency or abnormality in the glycoprotein complex GPIb/IX/V on the platelet membrane. This deficiency leads to impaired binding of platelets to von Willebrand factor and subsequently impaired platelet adhesion and function. The family history of easy bruising in the brother and bleeding during childbirth in the mother supports the genetic nature of the disorder."
