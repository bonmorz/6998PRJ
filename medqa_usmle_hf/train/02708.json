Proteus mirabilis is a common cause of urinary tract infections and is often associated with recurrent infections.

Escherichia coli is the most common cause of urinary tract infections, but the high urine pH makes it less likely. Citrobacter freundii and Staphylococcus epidermidis are not typically associated with urinary tract infections.
