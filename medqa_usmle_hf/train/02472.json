The patient\u2019s respiratory symptoms, including inspiratory stridor that improves while leaning forward, are consistent with laryngomalacia, which is a congenital condition where the larynx collapses inward during inhalation causing airway obstruction.

Laryngotracheitis can also present with stridor, but it usually occurs in children over one year of age and is typically associated with a viral infection."
