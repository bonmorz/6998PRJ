The combination of shortness of breath, wheezing, and cyanosis suggests chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is characterized by a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio. Increased erythropoietin is a common finding in COPD due to chronic hypoxemia causing erythropoietin production in the kidney to increase. Decreased serum bicarbonate may be seen in metabolic acidosis, which is not directly related to COPD. Nasal polyps and pleural effusion may be seen in other respiratory conditions, but are not specific to COPD."
