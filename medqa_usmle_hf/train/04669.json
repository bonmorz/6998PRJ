Fructosuria is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism that results from a deficiency in fructokinase activity. The lack of fructokinase activity results in the inability to phosphorylate fructose to fructose-1-phosphate. This causes excess fructose in the blood and urine. However, the activity of hexokinase, which is responsible for phosphorylating glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, is increased in fructosuria to compensate for the lack of fructokinase.
