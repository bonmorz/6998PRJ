The question describes that hormone A exerts its effects via dephosphorylation of intracellular proteins, which suggests it acts on a different 2nd messenger system than hormone B. Among the options, only option A, Adenylyl cyclase-cyclic AMP, is a different system than dephosphorylation of intracellular proteins. Option B, Direct cytoplasmic receptor binding, and option D, Tyrosine kinase, do not utilize 2nd messenger systems. Option C, Phospholipase C, is not the opposite of dephosphorylation and is therefore unlikely to be the correct answer."

Hormone B is secreted by \u03b1-cells, and it is known that glucagon is secreted by \u03b1-cells and antagonizes insulin, which is secreted by \u03b2-cells. Thus, hormone B is likely to be glucagon. Glucagon binds to a G protein-coupled receptor, which activates adenylyl cyclase, leading to an increase in cyclic AMP levels as a second messenger. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. The other options are not applicable to glucagon signaling."

The question mentions that hormone B antagonizes the actions of hormone A, which implies that hormone A and B have opposite effects. If hormone A utilizes dephosphorylation of different intracellular proteins, it suggests that hormone A utilizes a phosphatase enzyme. Phosphatases require a higher concentration of calcium ions to function, which suggests that hormone A utilizes a calcium-mediated signaling pathway. Since hormone B antagonizes the effects of hormone A, it is likely that hormone B utilizes a pathway opposite to a calcium-mediated signaling pathway. The only option among the choices that utilize a different pathway to calcium is the Adenylyl cyclase-cyclic AMP pathway, and thus, the correct answer is (A)."
