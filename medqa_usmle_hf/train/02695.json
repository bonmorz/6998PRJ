Calcium levels may also potentially be abnormal, but IgM is a more specific marker for these conditions. Natural killer cells and T-cells are types of white blood cells that may be affected in these conditions, but they are not as specific as IgM for the diagnosis."

The patient's symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of multiple myeloma, which is characterized by bone pain, fatigue, anemia, and organomegaly.
