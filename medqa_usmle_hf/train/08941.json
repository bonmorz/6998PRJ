Defective circulating IgA antibodies are associated with IgA nephropathy, which typically presents with hematuria and proteinuria but without edema. Inflammation of small-sized blood vessels may be a feature of vasculitis, but this is not suggested by the clinical presentation and laboratory findings in this case."
