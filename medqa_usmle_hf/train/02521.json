The symptoms and findings suggest Polyarteritis nodosa, which affects medium-sized arteries and causes systemic symptoms including muscle pain, weight loss, and abdominal and chest pain. The ulcers around the ankle and calves suggest cutaneous involvement. The negative perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies rules out Granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The other options are less likely given the patient\u2019s presentation."

Giant cell arteritis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis usually have positive anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and thromboangiitis obliterans usually presents with peripheral arterial disease and smoking history. The presence of chronic hepatitis B infection may be a risk factor for polyarteritis nodosa."

Urinalysis shows proteinuria and hematuria, which is common in PAN. The muscle biopsy findings are consistent with vasculitis.
