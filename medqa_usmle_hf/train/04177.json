Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that works by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Bacterial resistance to this drug can occur due to alterations in the 30S ribosomal subunit, which prevent binding of the drug and allow the bacteria to continue synthesizing proteins despite the presence of the antibiotic.
