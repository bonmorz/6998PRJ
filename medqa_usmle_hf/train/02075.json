The patient\u2019s history and physical examination findings suggest liver dysfunction, likely due to alcohol consumption.

Option (B) shows elevated AST and ALT levels, but not to the extreme levels seen in options (A) and (D) which suggest severe liver damage. Option (C) shows only mild elevations, which would be unexpected given the severity of the patient\u2019s symptoms and physical examination findings."
