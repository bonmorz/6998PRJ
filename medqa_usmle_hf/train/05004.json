The high serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels suggest hyperparathyroidism, but the low urinary calcium level is inconsistent. This suggests a defect in calcium-sensing receptors, which is a cause of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH). FHH is a benign, autosomal dominant condition that is caused by a defect in the calcium-sensing receptor of the parathyroid gland. This defect results in a decreased sensitivity of the parathyroid gland to calcium, which leads to an increase in parathyroid hormone secretion and, consequently, an increase in serum calcium levels. Despite the high serum calcium levels, there is a decrease in urinary calcium excretion because the kidneys are also affected by the defect in calcium-sensing receptors."

The high calcium and parathyroid hormone levels suggest primary hyperparathyroidism, which can be caused by hyperplasia of parathyroid chief cells or a defect in calcium-sensing receptors. The low urinary calcium level suggests the latter option, as defective calcium-sensing receptors would cause the kidneys to reabsorb more calcium and excrete less in urine. IL-1-induced osteoclast activation and extrarenal calcitriol production are not associated with primary hyperparathyroidism."
