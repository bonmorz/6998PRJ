This is consistent with a diagnosis of beta thalassemia minor, which is characterized by a decrease in beta-globin synthesis, resulting in milder anemia with microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells and elevated HbA2 levels. Hemoglobin Barts disease is associated with severe anemia in infants and hemoglobin H disease presents with moderate to severe anemia and target cells. Alpha thalassemia minima is asymptomatic and does not usually require treatment."
