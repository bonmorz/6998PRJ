This is a common form of immunodeficiency and typically resolves spontaneously by age 2-4.

The patient\u2019s history of recurrent ear infections, eczema, and allergic rhinitis suggest a possible immune deficiency. However, the fact that she has started to pull herself up to walk is a reassuring sign of normal development. The labs show low IgG levels but normal levels of other immunoglobulins, which is consistent with delayed onset of normal immunoglobulins. This condition is usually benign, and patients may outgrow it over time. Adenosine deaminase deficiency and defects in Bruton tyrosine kinase cause severe combined immunodeficiency, which is unlikely given the patient's history.

The patient\u2019s presentation suggests a possible delayed onset of normal immunoglobulins, as seen by the low levels of IgG.
