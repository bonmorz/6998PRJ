Arylsulfatase A is deficient in metachromatic leukodystrophy, and ceramidase deficiency is seen in Farber disease, but neither of these disorders present with cherry red spots."

The combination of symptoms and findings suggests a diagnosis of Niemann-Pick disease type A, which is caused by a deficiency in sphingomyelinase. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of sphingomyelin in various organs, leading to hepatosplenomegaly and neurological symptoms. The cherry red spots seen on ophthalmoscopic exam are also characteristic of this disease. Hexosaminidase A deficiency is seen in Tay-Sachs disease, which has a similar presentation but does not typically cause hepatosplenomegaly. Arylsulfatase A deficiency is seen in metachromatic leukodystrophy, which typically presents with progressive motor and cognitive decline, but not typically with hepatosplenomegaly. Ceramidase deficiency is seen in Farber disease, which typically presents with joint pain and subcutaneous nodules, but not typically with the neurological symptoms seen in this case."
