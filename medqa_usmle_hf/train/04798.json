The patient\u2019s history and physical examination suggest Prader-Willi syndrome, which is characterized by hyperphagia, obesity, short stature, and hypogonadism. Treatment with growth hormone and testosterone can address the hypogonadism and growth retardation, and possibly improve body composition. Calorie restriction alone is usually ineffective in controlling weight gain in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant not indicated for weight management. Laparoscopic gastric banding is not recommended in children under 13 years old. Levothyroxine is used to treat hypothyroidism, which is not a characteristic of Prader-Willi syndrome."
