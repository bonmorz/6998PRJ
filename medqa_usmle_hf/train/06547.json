During phase 0, rapid depolarization occurs due to the influx of calcium ions through the voltage-gated calcium channels. Therefore, the ion currents through the voltage-gated calcium channel studied by the molecular biologist primarily mediate phase 0 of the action potential in the sinoatrial node. Phases 1, 2, and 3 are primarily mediated by ion currents through other channels, and phase 4 is primarily due to the slow depolarization caused by a mixed Na+/K+ inward ionic current via funny channels (If)."

As the newly identified voltage-gated calcium channel is highly sensitive to nifedipine, which blocks the influx of calcium ions, it is most likely to be responsible for phase 0. The channel is activated at ~-40 mV, which is the threshold voltage for the upstroke of the action potential in the sinoatrial node. Voltage-dependent inactivation ensures that the channel is inactivated during the repolarization phase of the action potential. The channel does not appear to be involved in the phases 1, 3 or 4 of the cardiac action potential."
