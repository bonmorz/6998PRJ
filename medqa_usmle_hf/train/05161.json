The patient's symptoms of progressive muscle weakness and difficulty swallowing suggest a neuromuscular disorder such as myasthenia gravis. The laboratory studies show elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, further supporting a muscle disorder. The most appropriate next step in management would be electromyography to confirm the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Lumbar puncture would be useful to check for possible central nervous system involvement, but is not the best choice initially. Tensilon test is also used to diagnose myasthenia gravis, but is less accurate than electromyography. Temporal artery biopsy is used to diagnose giant cell arteritis, but is not indicated in this patient based on her symptoms and laboratory findings."

Tensilon test is used to diagnose myasthenia gravis, which is not likely given the presentation.
