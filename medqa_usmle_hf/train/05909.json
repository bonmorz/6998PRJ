The patient is presenting with symptoms of a heart attack (chest pain, radiating to jaw and left shoulder, difficulty breathing) and elevated troponin levels. The first-line antihypertensive agent in this case would be esmolol and intravenous nitroglycerin since the patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated and the goal is to reduce the workload on the heart to prevent further damage. Fenoldopam is used for hypertensive emergencies in patients with normal left ventricular function. Diazepam is not an antihypertensive agent and hydralazine may be used in hypertensive emergencies but is not the first-line option in this case."
