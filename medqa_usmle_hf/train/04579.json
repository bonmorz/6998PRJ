Allopurinol is used in the long-term management of gout and works by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for the production of uric acid. Therefore, the correct answer is (B). The other options either increase the level of uric acid or are not relevant to the management of gout."

The symptoms, laboratory and synovial fluid analysis are consistent with gout, which is caused by the deposition of urate crystals in the joints. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors like allopurinol are used in the long-term management of gout as they prevent the production of uric acid. Option A, inhibiting renal clearance of uric acid, would make gout worse. Option C, activating AMP deaminase, does not have a direct effect on uric acid levels. Option D, increasing renal clearance of uric acid, is the mechanism of action of uricosuric agents, which are only used in cases where the patient has normal renal function and urate overproduction."

The patient has presented with classic symptoms of gout, including elevated uric acid levels and negatively birefringent crystals in synovial fluid. The drug of choice for long-term management of gout is allopurinol, which inhibits xanthine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for converting purines to uric acid. This reduces the overall production of uric acid in the body and helps prevent gout flares. Option (A) refers to probenecid, which increases renal clearance of uric acid, while Option (C) refers to amprenavir, a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV. Option (D) is incorrect as it contradicts the mechanism of action of probenecid."
