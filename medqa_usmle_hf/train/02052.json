The patient\u2019s normal physical exam, parents\u2019 normal heights, and delayed bone age suggest a diagnosis of constitutional growth delay, which is a common cause of short stature in adolescents. Familial short stature would have already manifested in childhood and not lead to delayed bone age. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia would manifest as ambiguous genitalia and virilization in girls, but the patient has normal sexual development. Growth hormone deficiency would have additional symptoms like dry skin, constipation, and headaches, which are not present in this patient."

The patient\u2019s normal physical examination, normal vital signs, and delayed bone age suggest that the cause of his short stature is constitutional growth delay, which is a benign condition in which a child\u2019s growth rate is temporarily slower than average but eventually catch up during puberty. Familial short stature is unlikely because both parents are of normal height. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia causes salt-wasting and ambiguous genitalia but the patient did not present with these symptoms. Growth hormone deficiency can cause short stature, but the normal physical examination and normal vital signs make it less likely."
