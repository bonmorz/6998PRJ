The symptoms and history suggest a diagnosis of Meniere's disease, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. Treatment options for Meniere's disease include lifestyle changes and medications to control symptoms, as well as medications to prevent recurrent episodes. Oral hydrochlorothiazide is a first-line therapy for preventing recurrent episodes of Meniere's disease. Diazepam and dexamethasone may be used acutely to control symptoms but are not appropriate for long-term prevention of recurrent episodes. Ephedrine may worsen symptoms in patients with Meniere's disease."

Diazepam is a sedative and can alleviate symptoms during an acute attack, but it is not preventative. Ephedrine is a sympathomimetic drug that can cause an increase in blood pressure and heart rate, which can worsen symptoms in patients with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease.
