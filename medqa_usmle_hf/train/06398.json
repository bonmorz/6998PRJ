The symptoms, including difficulty swallowing, muscle weakness, atrophy of the tongue, and increased reflexes, suggest the most likely diagnosis is Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Inclusion-body myositis usually presents with muscle weakness in the proximal muscles of the limbs, while subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord is associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Cervical spondylosis with myelopathy is a probable diagnosis but the muscle atrophy is not commonly seen."

The atrophy of the tongue, muscle weakness and stiffness, and hyperreflexia support this diagnosis. Inclusion-body myositis and cervical spondylosis with myelopathy have different symptoms such as muscle pain and sensory loss.

The patient presents with bulbar symptoms (difficulty swallowing, atrophy of the tongue) and signs of both upper and lower motor neuron involvement (muscle weakness, muscle stiffness, decreased and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes, extensor plantar response). These symptoms and signs are highly suggestive of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Inclusion-body myositis typically presents with muscle weakness, but without bulbar symptoms or upper motor neuron signs. Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord typically presents with sensory ataxia, loss of proprioception, and spastic paraparesis, but without bulbar symptoms or upper motor neuron signs. Cervical spondylosis with myelopathy may present with symptoms similar to ALS, but usually has specific findings on an MRI of the spine."

Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord is characterized by sensory disturbances such as numbness and tingling in the feet and hands. Cervical spondylosis with myelopathy usually presents with neck pain, and the muscle weakness and atrophy are restricted to the upper extremities."
