She is also due for HPV vaccine since she has not received it yet. It is recommended for females to receive HPV vaccine at age 11-12 years and up to age 26 years. The current guidelines recommend starting cervical cancer screening at age 21 years and cytology and HPV testing every 3 or 5 years depending on age and other factors. However, since the patient is only 16 years old and therefore not due for cervical cancer screening yet, option (D) is the correct answer."

Since the patient is sexually active, HPV vaccine is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for females from age 9 to 26. While cytology and HPV testing are also important screening methods for cervical cancer, the patient is too young to be screened every 3 or 5 years. The current recommendation is to begin screening at age 21 and repeat every 3 years if using cytology alone or every 5 years if using cytology and HPV testing together. Therefore, the best next step in management for this patient is to administer HPV vaccine."
