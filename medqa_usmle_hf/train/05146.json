The patient has symptoms of meningitis, with fever and confusion, and the CSF analysis shows a high leukocyte count and low glucose concentration. The patient also has lymphadenopathy, which suggests a possible lymphoma-related infection. Therefore, the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy would be a combination of antibiotics that cover both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, such as Vancomycin, ampicillin, and cefepime. Acyclovir and dexamethasone would be appropriate if the patient had herpes simplex encephalitis, but this is not indicated based on the clinical findings."
