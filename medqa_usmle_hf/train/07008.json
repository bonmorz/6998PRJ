The patient's symptoms suggest a medial meniscus tear, which is commonly caused by a twisting or rotating force to the knee joint, often seen in sports injuries like soccer. The popping sound and sharp pain with locking sensation are also common symptoms of a meniscus tear. External rotation eliciting sharp pain further supports the diagnosis of a medial meniscus tear rather than ACL or PCL injury. Lateral meniscus tear can also cause similar symptoms, but medial meniscus tears are more common."

The popping sound, severe pain, and locking sensation suggest a possible meniscus tear. The medial meniscus is more commonly injured than the lateral meniscus in sports-related injuries, especially in soccer. The physical examination finding of tenderness at the medial aspect of the knee supports this diagnosis. The anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments are less likely to be injured in this scenario."
