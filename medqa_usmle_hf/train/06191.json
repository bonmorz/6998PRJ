Pyelonephritis typically presents with fever and leukocytosis, which is not present in this patient. Renal oncocytoma is a benign tumor and is less likely to cause symptoms such as pain and blood in the urine. The elevated hematocrit and hemoglobin can be attributed to erythropoietin secretion by the tumor."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest renal cell carcinoma, as there is gradual pain on the right flank, blood in urine, and a significant smoking history.

Pyelonephritis usually presents with fever and leukocytosis in addition to flank pain and hematuria. Renal oncocytoma is a benign tumor and is usually asymptomatic, and it is rare for it to present with hematuria.
