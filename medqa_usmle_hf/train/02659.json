Brimonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that decreases aqueous humor production and increases uveoscleral outflow by causing relaxation of the ciliary muscle and increasing prostaglandin release. Option A is incorrect as brimonidine actually decreases, not increases, aqueous humor formation. Option B refers to beta-blockers, not alpha-2 adrenergic agonists like brimonidine. Option C is incorrect as brimonidine does not have a significant effect on blood pressure control."

The patient has symptoms of reduced visual field and enlarged blind spots, as well as mildly increased IOP, suggesting the diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma. Brimonidine is a medication used to treat glaucoma by decreasing production of aqueous humor and increasing uveoscleral outflow. The mechanism of action is through selective activation of alpha-2 receptors, leading to increased release of prostaglandins which relax the ciliary muscle and increase uveoscleral outflow, thereby reducing IOP. Option (A) is wrong as this medication reduces the production of aqueous humor. Option (B) is wrong as it describes the mechanism of beta-blockers, not brimonidine. Option (C) is wrong as brimonidine does not have a significant effect on blood pressure."

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest glaucoma, which is characterized by increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and reduction in visual field. Brimonidine is a medication used to treat glaucoma by decreasing IOP. It works by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in the eye, leading to increased uveoscleral outflow and decreased aqueous humor production. This is described in option (D), which is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because brimonidine actually decreases aqueous humor production. Option (B) is incorrect because beta-blockers, not alpha-agonists like brimonidine, are used to block beta-receptors to reduce aqueous humor production.

The patient's symptoms and exam findings suggest primary open-angle glaucoma, which is characterized by increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and reduced visual field. Brimonidine is a medication that reduces IOP by increasing uveoscleral outflow. Its primary mechanism of action is through selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonism, which leads to decreased aqueous humor production and increased uveoscleral outflow. Therefore, answer (D) is correct. Answer (A) is incorrect because increased cAMP would increase aqueous humor formation, which would worsen glaucoma. Answer (B) is incorrect because blocking beta-receptors would also worsen glaucoma by reducing aqueous humor outflow. Answer (C) is incorrect because while brimonidine can cause peripheral vasoconstriction, it is not used primarily for the treatment of hypertension."
