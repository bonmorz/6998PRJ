Thiamine is a cofactor for many enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (\u03b1-KGDH), which rely on thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) as a cofactor. The synthesis of TPP is dependent on transketolase, which is a thiamine-dependent enzyme, and RNA polymerase, which is one of the options listed, is also thiamine-dependent. Therefore, the deficient substance that is most likely responsible for this patient\u2019s symptoms is associated with RNA polymerase."
