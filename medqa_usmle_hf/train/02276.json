The patient's symptoms suggest acute appendicitis, which commonly presents with gradually progressing abdominal pain that moves to the right lower quadrant. The right upper quadrant tenderness and the leukocyte count suggest something else, but pyuria suggests possible urinary tract involvement. However, nephrolithiasis does not explain the right upper quadrant tenderness, and acute cholangitis and HELLP syndrome present with different symptoms such as jaundice and hypertension. Therefore, acute appendicitis is the most likely diagnosis."
