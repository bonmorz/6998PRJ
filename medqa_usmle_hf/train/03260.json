In this case, the patient no longer cries at physician visits because he has not been reinforced for that behavior for a long time, despite having been reinforced for good behavior instead. Positive reinforcement involves providing a reward to increase the frequency of a behavior, but in this case, the behavior of crying has decreased, not increased. Classical conditioning involves pairing a neutral stimulus with a conditioned stimulus to elicit a response, which is not directly applicable in this situation. Acting out refers to behavior that is done to get attention or express feelings, which does not fit this scenario as the patient no longer cries to express feelings."

The mother's positive reinforcement through candy rewards potentially led to extinction of that fear response, as the child learned that good behavior was associated with positive outcomes (candy) rather than negative ones (needles or blood draws). Therefore, the correct answer is (C) extinction."

Classical conditioning would involve the development of an association between the clinic and the negative experience of getting blood checks, which is not the case here. Positive reinforcement is the most likely explanation as the patient is receiving a reward (candy) for good behavior during clinic visits. However, the fact that the patient no longer cries even without the reward suggests that extinction has also occurred, meaning that the previous association between the clinic and negative experiences has faded over time due to lack of reinforcement. Acting out refers to behavior that is meant to draw attention, which is not the case here."

The patient's behavior has changed due to the extinction of his previous negative association with the clinic, meaning that the behavior is no longer being reinforced. Additionally, positive reinforcement may have played a role in the patient's improved behavior as he associates good behavior with candy, but the primary reason for the change in behavior is extinction. Classical conditioning is the process of pairing a neutral stimulus with a response, which is not relevant to this scenario. Acting out is a term used to describe an individual's behavior when experiencing emotional distress, which is also not relevant to this scenario."

Classical conditioning involves pairing a stimulus (such as a clinic visit) with a response (such as crying) to create an association between the two. Positive reinforcement involves providing something desirable (such as candy) after a behavior to increase the likelihood of that behavior occurring again in the future. Extinction occurs when a previously learned behavior (such as crying at clinic visits) disappears over time because the previously paired stimulus and response (clinic visit and crying) are no longer consistently paired. In this case, the patient\u2019s crying behavior at clinic visits may have been classically conditioned due to their association with the unpleasant experience of undergoing blood checks for leukemia treatment. However, over time the patient\u2019s visits to the clinic no longer consistently resulted in painful experiences, and they may have stopped crying due to the extinction of the previously learned behavior. The candy may have served as positive reinforcement for the patient\u2019s good behavior during future clinic visits, but it is not the primary reason why the patient no longer cries at visits. Therefore, the best answer is (C), extinction."

Classical conditioning involves pairing a neutral stimulus with a natural response in order to create a conditioned response over time. Positive reinforcement involves adding a desirable stimulus to increase a behavior. Extinction involves stopping the reinforcement of a behavior in order to reduce or eliminate it. Acting out refers to outwardly expressing inner emotions through disruptive or inappropriate behavior. In this scenario, the use of candy as a reward for good behavior is an example of positive reinforcement. The patient's enjoyment of clinic visits could be seen as a conditioned response to the positive reinforcement of candy. However, the fact that the patient no longer cries at clinic visits suggests that the behavior of crying has been extinguished by the lack of reinforcement (i.e. attention or reward) for that behavior. Therefore, the best explanation for why the patient no longer cries at physician visits is extinction."
