The patient\u2019s response indicates a lack of understanding of the treatment\u2019s details, which raises concerns about her decision-making capacity. The physician should ensure that the patient fully understands the risks and benefits of the treatment and has decision-making capacity before proceeding with the therapy. This addresses the ethical principle of patient autonomy, where patients have the right to make informed decisions about their healthcare. Therapeutic privilege refers to the decision to withhold information from a patient if disclosure would cause harm. Patient competence refers to a legal determination made by a court to determine if a patient is capable of making their own decisions."
