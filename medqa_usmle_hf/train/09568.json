Since the patient has not responded to previous therapies and the fluid keeps returning, a pericardial window may be the best option for a therapeutic and diagnostic approach. The other options either have already been done or do not provide both therapeutic and diagnostic benefits. The low QRS voltage on the ECG suggests that the fluid is compressing the heart, making a pericardial window even more necessary."
