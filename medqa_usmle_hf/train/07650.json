The combination of recurrent respiratory infections, nasal polyps, and bulky, foul-smelling stools are suggestive of cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is known to cause male infertility due to the absence of the vas deferens. Option A is related to celiac disease, which is not supportive of the patient\u2019s symptoms. Option C is used to diagnose asthma, which is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. Option D is one of the immunoglobulin deficiencies that can increase the risk of recurrent infections, but it is not specifically associated with CF."
