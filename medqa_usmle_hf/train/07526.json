Among the options, the newborn is at greatest risk of developing rickets, a bone disease caused by vitamin D deficiency. Breast milk alone does not provide enough vitamin D, so vitamin D supplementation is recommended for breast-fed infants. Scaly dermatitis can be caused by essential fatty acid deficiency, which is rare in breast-fed infants. Intracranial bleed is a potential complication of delivery or trauma, but the newborn has already undergone standard testing and treatment. Microcytic anemia is not commonly seen in newborns and is unlikely in this case given the lack of other symptoms or findings on examination."
