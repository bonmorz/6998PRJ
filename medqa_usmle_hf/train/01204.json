Nitric oxide is a molecule that is released by vascular endothelial cells and plays an important role in vasodilation, which helps maintain normal blood flow. In atherosclerosis, the production of nitric oxide is decreased, which can lead to decreased blood flow and an increased risk of heart attack.
