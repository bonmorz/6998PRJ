The patient's altered mental status and high serum glucose levels suggest hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The first step in management is to administer fluids to correct dehydration and increase blood pressure. IV NS (normal saline) is the best option as it is isotonic and can help restore tissue perfusion. IV \u00bd NS has a lower sodium concentration and may not be as effective. IV D5W (dextrose 5% in water) is contraindicated as it can worsen hyperglycemia. IV insulin is essential for treatment but should not be the first step in management."
