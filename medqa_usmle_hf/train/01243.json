The symptoms suggest an anaphylactic reaction, which is mediated by IgE crosslinking on mast cells and subsequent release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators, including tryptase. Elevated tryptase levels are indicative of mast cell activation and can help confirm the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. IgG production by plasma cells and the formation of immune complexes are not involved in the mechanism of anaphylaxis. Cross-linking of IgG on mast cells is involved in a different type of hypersensitivity reaction, called type II."

When a patient with allergies is exposed to an allergen, the immune system produces large amounts of IgE antibodies that recognize the allergen. These antibodies attach to mast cells and basophils, causing them to release histamine, prostaglandins, and other mediators that cause the symptoms of an allergic reaction. Tryptase is a mast cell protease that is released during anaphylaxis and can be used as a marker of mast cell activation. Therefore, the elevated tryptase level indicates cross-linking of IgE on mast cells."
