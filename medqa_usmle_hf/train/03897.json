Inward deviation of the right eye and white reflex on the right eye are classic signs of retinoblastoma, a type of cancer that primarily affects young children.

The patient's older sister's eye disease and the presence of a red reflex in the left eye suggest that the right eye has a visual axis obstruction. This obstruction could be caused by a retinoblastoma, but it could also be caused by other conditions such as cataract or vitreous hemorrhage. Therefore, the patient is not necessarily at increased risk for any of the answer choices."
