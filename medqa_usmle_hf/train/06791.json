The patient has increased thirst and urine output, as well as low urine osmolality, indicating diabetes insipidus (DI). The water deprivation test confirmed the diagnosis.

Option (A) is not the correct option because counseling to decrease water intake would not address the underlying cause of DI. Option (C) is incorrect because intravenous fluids would not address the underlying cause of DI and might lead to excessive fluid intake.
