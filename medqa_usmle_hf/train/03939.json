The symptoms suggest Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), resulting in elevated levels of uric acid. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition should inhibit the conversion of xanthine to urate, which can be achieved by using allopurinol. The other options are not related to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome."

Xanthine to urate conversion is catalyzed by HPRT, therefore pharmacotherapy should inhibit this conversion. Option (D) is correct."

The symptoms suggest Lesch Nyhan syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that causes increased levels of uric acid in urine and can lead to neurological symptoms such as muscle weakness and self-injurious behavior. Inhibiting the conversion of xanthine to urate can help reduce the production of uric acid and control the symptoms. Option (A) refers to the urea cycle, (B) to pyrimidine biosynthesis, and (C) to purine metabolism, which are not relevant to this condition."

The orange, sandy residue in the boy\u2019s diaper indicates a problem with metabolism of purines, which can lead to hyperuricemia and gout-like symptoms.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be to inhibit the conversion of xanthine to urate, which can be achieved with allopurinol.
