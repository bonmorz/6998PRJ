This is a hallmark finding of mucormycosis, which is caused by fungus in the order Mucorales, including the Rhizopus species. Therefore, (C) Rhizopus infection is the correct answer. Cryptococcal and Candida infections typically do not present with necrotic tissue, and gram negative bacterial infections do not typically cause mucormycosis."
