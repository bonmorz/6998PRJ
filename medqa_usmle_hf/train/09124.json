The x-ray shows a tibial plateau fracture, which can cause compartment syndrome due to increased pressure in the lower leg compartments causing compression of nerves and blood vessels. The weak pulses and delayed capillary refill suggest compartment syndrome, and thus the most appropriate next step in management would be fasciotomy. Low molecular weight heparin is used for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Open reduction and internal fixation is not indicated as the fracture is not severely displaced. IVC filter placement is not indicated as there is no evidence of pulmonary embolism."
