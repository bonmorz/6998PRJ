The symptoms and exam findings suggest that the patient may have Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome or another cause of acute motor weakness. The best initial step in management would be to measure vital capacity using spirometry to determine the need for respiratory support. Option A, Dexamethasone, is not indicated for acute motor weakness, but may be used in certain cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Intubation is not necessary at this point and is only indicated if vital capacity is severely decreased or if respiratory failure occurs. Pyridostigmine is only used in cases of myasthenia gravis and would not be effective in this case."
