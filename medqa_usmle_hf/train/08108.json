The symptoms suggest that the baby has congenital cyanotic heart disease, possibly due to exposure to a drug that inhibits the 50S ribosomal subunit during the mother\u2019s pregnancy. This would have affected the development of the baby\u2019s heart. Option D, which inhibits the 50S ribosomal subunit, is the most likely mechanism of action for this drug. Options A-C are antibiotics and not relevant to this scenario."

The medication given was likely an antibiotic to treat the infection. The newborn's symptoms suggest he has sepsis, which can be caused by Brucella transmitted from the mother. The mechanism of action of antibiotics used to treat Brucella is inhibition of protein synthesis, specifically the 50S ribosomal subunit. Therefore, the correct answer is (D)."

The mother\u2019s symptoms suggest that she had Brucellosis, a bacterial infection commonly found in rural areas of India. The medication prescribed was likely a 50S ribosomal subunit inhibitor antibiotic. The mechanism of action of this antibiotic is to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit, inhibiting the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids. The baby\u2019s symptoms suggest that he was exposed to the antibiotic in utero and developed Gray Baby Syndrome, a rare but serious side effect of some antibiotics that results in altered metabolism and accumulation of the antibiotic, leading to cyanosis, cardiovascular collapse, and respiratory distress."

Therefore, the drug prescribed to the mother that led to the child's presentation is likely a 50S ribosomal subunit inhibitor.

The drug that was prescribed to the mother could have been a 50S ribosomal subunit inhibitor, which could have crossed the placenta and caused the symptoms in the newborn. The options of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, DNA gyrase inhibitor, and 30S ribosomal subunit inhibitor are not commonly used antibiotics for Brucella infection."
