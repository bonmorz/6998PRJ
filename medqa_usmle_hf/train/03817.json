The patient has multiple substances in his possession and symptoms that suggest opioid use, such as somnolence, non-reactive pupils, and respiratory depression. Naloxone is the reversal agent for opioids and is the best next step in management to try to reverse the respiratory depression and other symptoms. Flumazenil is for benzodiazepine toxicity and N-acetylcysteine is for acetaminophen toxicity, but there is no clear indication for either in this case. Supportive therapy, thiamine, and dextrose can be given, but they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms."
