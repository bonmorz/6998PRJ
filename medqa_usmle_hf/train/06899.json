The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest a viral myocarditis caused by Coxsackievirus infection, which is a common cause of viral myocarditis in healthy young adults. The third heart sound, displaced point of maximal impact, and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities up to the knees suggest cardiac involvement. The ECG and echocardiogram findings also support this. Acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina are less likely in a young healthy individual with no known risk factors. Cocaine abuse can cause similar symptoms but the patient's history mentions only occasional marijuana use with friends."

This is commonly seen with coxsackievirus infection, which is a common cause of viral myocarditis. Cocaine abuse can also cause cardiovascular effects, but the absence of a history of regular use or recent use, as well as the presence of a recent cold, makes viral myocarditis a more likely cause than cocaine abuse."
