The sharp pain in the anterior part of the chest is a common symptom in patients with pericarditis. The relief of pain while sitting or leaning forward, the presence of a \"knock\" on auscultation, and Kussmaul sign are all classic physical signs of constrictive pericarditis. The widespread ST segment elevation and PR depression on ECG are also characteristic of pericarditis. Pleurisy would present with pain on breathing and coughing, and tamponade would present with hypotension and pulsus paradoxus. Right ventricular myocardial infarction would present with ST segment elevation in leads V1\u2013V4."

The decreased intensity of pain while sitting and leaning forward is known as the \"pericardial knock,\" and Kussmaul sign (an increase in JVP on inspiration) is often seen with constrictive pericarditis. The positive ECG findings also support this diagnosis. Pleurisy would typically result in more pleuritic chest pain and would not be associated with pericardial sounds on examination. Cardiac tamponade may also present with chest pain and decreased cardiac output, but it would typically present with hypotension and a different physical exam finding of pulsus paradoxus. Right ventricular myocardial infarction would be expected to present with right-sided heart failure symptoms and ECG findings localized to right-sided leads."
