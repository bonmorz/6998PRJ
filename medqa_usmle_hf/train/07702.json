The fever, headache, exophthalmos, decreased extraocular movements and sensation near the affected eye suggest the most likely diagnosis is cavernous sinus thrombosis. The patient's medical history of hypertension and use of oral contraceptive pills increase her risk for developing this condition. The acute alteration in mental status suggests worsening of the condition and the need for immediate intervention. A CT scan should be done to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. Acute closed angle glaucoma, periorbital cellulitis, and intracranial hemorrhage do not have the same presentation as cavernous sinus thrombosis."

The symptoms and progression of the patient's condition suggest the most likely diagnosis to be cavernous sinus thrombosis, as it presents with fever, headache, and cranial nerve deficits (reduced extraocular movements in the affected eye, decreased sensation in V1 and V2). Exophthalmos is also a common symptom. Intracranial hemorrhage involves bleeding in the brain tissue and can be fatal but does not usually present with exophthalmos or cranial nerve deficits. Acute closed angle glaucoma presents with a sudden onset of severe eye pain, blurred vision, and halos around lights. Periorbital cellulitis presents with redness, swelling, and tenderness around the eye but does not involve cranial nerve deficits or exophthalmos."

Acute closed angle glaucoma is unlikely because the patient has exophthalmos and decreased extraocular movements, which are not typical features of acute closed angle glaucoma. Periorbital cellulitis does not explain the other symptoms present, and intracranial hemorrhage would not typically present with the same constellation of symptoms."

The patient's symptoms, including fever, headache, exophthalmos, decreased extraocular movements, and decreased sensation in the distribution of V1 and V2, are indicative of cavernous sinus thrombosis.

Intracranial hemorrhage may present with altered mental status and/or focal neurological deficits, but the presence of exophthalmos and reduced extraocular movements make this diagnosis less likely than cavernous sinus thrombosis."

The combination of fever, rapid progression of symptoms, exophthalmos, reduced extraocular movements, and decreased sensation in the distribution of V1 and V2 points towards this diagnosis. Acute closed angle glaucoma will cause severe eye pain and a fixed, mid-dilated pupil. Periorbital cellulitis will cause eyelid swelling and redness, but not the neurological symptoms seen in this patient. Intracranial hemorrhage may cause altered mental status, but it is not supported by the patient's ocular symptoms."
