A direct Coombs test is used to detect antibodies that have already coated the surface of red blood cells, which is not relevant in this case. Measurement of serum vitamin B12 is not indicated based on the patient\u2019s presentation. White blood cell differential may be done as part of routine blood testing, but is not specifically indicated in this case."
