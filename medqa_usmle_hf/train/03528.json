The patient\u2019s elevated beta-hCG levels suggest persistent gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD), and bilateral adnexal masses are often associated with GTD. The multiple thin-walled cysts are characteristic of theca lutein cysts, which can result from increased levels of beta-hCG. Corpus luteal cysts are possible during early pregnancy, but the patient has a history of an empty gestational sack, which suggests no pregnancy at the current time. Ectopic pregnancy can be ruled out by the absence of pain, as well as the previous treatment with methotrexate. Endometriomas are also a possibility, but the patient\u2019s history and clinical presentation are more suggestive of GTD."
