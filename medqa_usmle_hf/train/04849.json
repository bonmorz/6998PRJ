Compression stockings can also help reduce edema, but they are not as effective as pharmacotherapy.

The patient\u2019s hypertension and diabetes suggest that the most appropriate drug to reduce the risk of edema is enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, as it can reduce blood pressure and also reduce fluid buildup in the tissues. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that can help remove excess fluid, but it can also cause electrolyte imbalances. Compression stockings can help with edema but do not address the underlying cause. Switching to nifedipine, another calcium channel blocker like amlodipine, is unlikely to make a significant difference."
