Antihistamines are commonly used drugs that can have anticholinergic effects. Cannabis and amphetamine can cause altered mental status and increased heart rate, but they commonly cause other symptoms such as hyperactive bowel sounds and diaphoresis. Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause confusion, but it also commonly causes headache, nausea, and vomiting."
