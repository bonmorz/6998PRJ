This is most likely a benign condition called Mongolian spot, which is common among infants with darker skin tones. Reassurance is the best step in management, as there is no treatment necessary for Mongolian spot. However, if there are concerns about potential abuse or neglect, appropriate action should be taken, such as informing child protective services. A radiographic skeletal survey or topical hydrocortisone cream is not necessary or useful in this case."
