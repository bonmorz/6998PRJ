It is important to note that while a chest X-ray may be helpful in ruling out other causes of respiratory distress, it is not a definitive diagnostic tool for anaphylaxis. Immediate administration of epinephrine and transfer to a higher level of care should be considered in cases of suspected anaphylaxis."
