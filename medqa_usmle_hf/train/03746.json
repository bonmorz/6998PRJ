The patient\u2019s history of a previous aneurysm, along with the new onset of severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, and photophobia suggests a potential recurrence or new aneurysm. The subtle left-sided ptosis and mid-dilated pupil on the left are indicative of Horner\u2019s syndrome which can occur secondary to an aneurysm. The right-sided weakness further supports the need for a further diagnostic workup as it may suggest neurological involvement. Therefore, (A) right-sided weakness is the correct answer."

The patient has a past history of an aneurysm and presents with severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and a dilated pupil with ptosis on the left. These symptoms suggest the possibility of an acute aneurysm rupture, which can cause hemorrhage and lead to neurological deficits such as weakness. Therefore, the finding of right-sided weakness is the most concerning and warrants further diagnostic workup, such as imaging studies to evaluate for a possible aneurysm rupture. Obesity, age of onset, and photophobia are not as strongly indicative of a need for further workup in this context."
