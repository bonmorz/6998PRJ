The patient has a history of transient ischemic attacks and carotid stenosis on both sides, but more severe on the left. The best next step would be to perform a carotid endarterectomy on the left side only, as it has a higher degree of stenosis and is the likely source of the patient's symptoms. Repeat carotid ultrasound in 6 months would not address the underlying issue and may allow the condition to worsen. Increasing atorvastatin to 80 mg daily may help lower cholesterol levels but would not address the carotid stenosis. Carotid artery angioplasty with stenting is an option, but is generally reserved for cases where endarterectomy is contraindicated or not feasible."

The patient has repeated episodes of weakness and stenosis on both carotid arteries, which put her at high risk for a stroke. Endarterectomy is the preferred treatment for symptomatic carotid stenosis greater than 70%, as it has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke compared to medical therapy alone. Option A is not appropriate as the patient has symptomatic carotid stenosis. Option B may help lower cholesterol levels, but it does not address the underlying problem of carotid stenosis. Option C is risky and associated with higher rates of complications compared to endarterectomy."

While increasing atorvastatin may help reduce future cardiovascular events, it will not address the underlying issue causing the TIAs.
