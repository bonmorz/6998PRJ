The symptoms described are classic for Paget disease of the breast, which is a rare form of breast cancer that begins in the ducts of the breast before spreading to the skin of the nipple and areola. Inflammatory breast cancer would present with more diffuse erythema and edema involving the entire breast, and mastitis or breast abscess would show signs of infection, such as fever and localized tenderness.
