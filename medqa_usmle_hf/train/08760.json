Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by intrusive, unwanted, and distressing thoughts, images or urges (obsessions) that cause anxiety or discomfort, and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) that are performed to neutralize or alleviate the anxiety and discomfort caused by the obsessions. Patients with OCD usually have insight into their condition, and they may feel shame or embarrassment about their compulsions, which can be time-consuming and interfere with their daily activities. The disturbing thoughts are usually ego-dystonic, meaning that they are inconsistent with the patient's personality or self-image. Deep brain stimulation is a treatment option for severe cases of OCD that do not respond to other therapies. Compulsions are not logically related to the obsessions, and even if the patient realizes that the compulsions are irrational or excessive, he or she may still feel compelled to perform them. In this case, the patient's skin problems and psychiatric symptoms suggest that he may have OCD with contamination and washing compulsions."
