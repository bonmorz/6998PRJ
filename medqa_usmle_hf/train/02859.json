The presence of a maculopapular rash on the palms and soles of the feet, along with a history of camping in North Carolina, points to Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which is caused by a gram-negative bacteria transmitted via the Dermacentor tick. Option A refers to syphilis, which can also cause a rash, but it presents differently and is not associated with a recent camping trip. Option C is referring to Lyme disease, which is transmitted by the Ixodes tick, but it presents differently than Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Option D refers to a variety of viruses, but none of them are associated with the specific symptoms and clinical picture described in the scenario."

Option A is incorrect as spirochetes cause syphilis. Option C is incorrect as the bacterium transmitted via the Ixodes tick causes Lyme disease, which presents with a different rash. Option D is incorrect as the patient\u2019s symptoms are not suggestive of a non-enveloped RNA virus."

Option A is incorrect as the patient denies any contact with sick individuals and reports unprotected sex, which suggests a tickborne illness.
