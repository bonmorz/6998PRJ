The patient\u2019s symptoms and signs suggest congestive heart failure, and an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray confirms it. Elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a marker of congestive heart failure. Sarcomere duplication is a rare genetic disorder and is unlikely to be the cause. An opening snap with a low-pitched diastolic rumble is indicative of mitral stenosis, which is not present in this case. Electrical alternans may be seen in pericardial effusion, but there is no evidence of pericardial effusion in this case."

The symptoms, physical examination, and imaging findings suggest acute congestive heart failure with possible pericarditis. Elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is typically seen in patients with heart failure and can help confirm the diagnosis. Sarcomere duplication is a rare genetic disease that causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but is unlikely in this patient who had an upper respiratory tract infection. An opening snap with low-pitched diastolic rumble is characteristic of mitral stenosis, which is not suggested by the patient's history and physical examination. Electrical alternans can be seen in cardiac tamponade, but there is no evidence to suggest this diagnosis in this patient."
