Incentive spirometry, which consists of taking deep breaths and holding them for several seconds, helps to prevent respiratory complications by improving lung expansion and preventing atelectasis. Intravenous antibiotics may be used to prevent infections but do not specifically target postoperative pneumonia. Hyperbaric oxygenation is not a standard practice for preventing postoperative pneumonia. Shallow breathing exercises may worsen pulmonary function and increase the risk of postoperative pneumonia."

Postoperative pneumonia is a common complication after surgery, particularly in patients who have undergone thoracic or upper abdominal surgery.

In-hospital intravenous antibiotics are used to treat existing infections, while hyperbaric oxygenation is used to treat certain medical conditions like decompression sickness and carbon monoxide poisoning. Shallow breathing exercises are unlikely to be effective in preventing postoperative pneumonia."
