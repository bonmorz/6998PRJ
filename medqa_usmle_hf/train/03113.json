The patient has several symptoms that suggest hypothyroidism, including fatigue, difficulty concentrating, cold intolerance, and constipation. The presence of a nodule on physical examination also raises concern for thyroid disease. Thyroid ultrasound is the best next step to evaluate the nodule and assess the overall function and structure of the thyroid gland. The other options are less likely to be helpful for the specific presentation of this patient. Serum T3 levels may be used to diagnose hyperthyroidism, but do not provide enough information about the overall function and structure of the thyroid gland. Serum calcitonin levels may be tested in patients with medullary thyroid cancer, which is typically associated with a genetic mutation, but this is not the most likely diagnosis for this patient. Radionuclide thyroid scans may be helpful in some cases to differentiate between benign and malignant nodules, but as the patient is presenting with several symptoms of hypothyroidism, thyroid ultrasound is a better choice."
