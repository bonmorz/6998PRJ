This patient\u2019s persistent desire to be a girl, discomfort with male clothing and activities, and preference for female friends starting from preschool suggest gender dysphoria. Body dysmorphic disorder is a preoccupation with perceived flaws in appearance that are not visible to others, and fetishistic disorder involves recurrent intense sexual arousal from the use of inanimate objects or body parts unrelated to the individual for sexual arousal or gratification. Gender nonconformity refers to a child\u2019s expression of gender that is incongruent with societal expectations."

The presented symptoms and behaviors suggest that the most likely diagnosis is Gender dysphoria, which is the distress caused by the discrepancy between a person's gender identity and their sex assigned at birth. Gender nonconformity only describes the behavior of not conforming to typical gender roles, without the distress caused by it. Body dysmorphic disorder is characterized by obsessive concerns about a specific aspect of one's appearance, which is not the case here. Fetishistic disorder involves sexual arousal or gratification from an object, body part, or situation, which is also not applicable here."

Gender dysphoria is the term used to describe the distress a person feels as a result of the sex and gender they were assigned at birth.

Body dysmorphic disorder is characterized by persistent and excessive preoccupation with an imagined or slight defect in appearance, and fetishistic disorder involves a persistent sexual fixation on a specific object, material, or body part.
