The patient has symptoms of pulmonary hypertension and polysomnography shows hypopneic and apneic events, which indicate sleep apnea syndrome. This increases the risk of right ventricular failure, which can lead to cor pulmonale. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary embolism could also lead to pulmonary hypertension, but in this case, sleep apnea syndrome is the likelier cause. Left ventricular failure is not directly related to the patient's symptoms."
