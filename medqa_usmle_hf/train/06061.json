Amyloid deposition in the cardiac atria is associated with atrial fibrillation, and the peptide in question is likely atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which is known to cause vasodilation. ANP is involved in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance. It is produced by the atria of the heart and is released in response to atrial stretch or volume overload. Its actions include vasodilation, natriuresis, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, all of which help to reduce blood pressure."

The question describes a case of cardiac amyloidosis, which is often associated with deposition of ATTR (transthyretin) amyloid in the heart. ATTR is primarily produced by the liver and its normal function is to transport thyroxine and retinol-binding protein in the blood. There is no evidence that it has any of the functions listed in the answer choices except for vasodilation, which is attributed to a related peptide called amylin. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
