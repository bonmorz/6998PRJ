When treating patients with ACE inhibitors, there is a decrease in the filtration fraction due to the decrease in efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, which increases renal blood flow. The glomerular filtration rate will decrease, and there may be an increase in renal plasma flow. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer."

Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that can dilate blood vessels and improve blood flow to the kidneys.
