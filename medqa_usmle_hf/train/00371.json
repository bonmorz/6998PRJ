The patient presents with weakness and loss of vibration and position sensation in the left lower extremity, as well as loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity.

Anterior cord syndrome involves loss of motor and sensory function below the level of the lesion, while posterior cord syndrome involves loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation."
