The symptoms, including the loss of speech and motor skills, as well as the hand rubbing and cognitive delay, suggest Rett syndrome. This is most commonly caused by a mutation in the MECP2 gene on the X chromosome, which codes for methyl-CpG-binding protein 2. Therefore, the answer is (A) microdeletion of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 on X-chromosome. The other options are associated with Fragile X syndrome, Myotonic dystrophy, and Williams syndrome, respectively, and do not present with the same symptoms as seen in this patient."

The symptoms described in the question are consistent with Rett syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in the MECP2 gene, leading to a loss of function of the MeCP2 protein.
