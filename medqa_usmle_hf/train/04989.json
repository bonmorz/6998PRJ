The prednisone therapy is likely to suppress the immune system and downregulate neutrophil adhesion molecules, resulting in an increase in circulating neutrophils and a decrease in lymphocytes. Therefore, the answer is (D) Downregulation of neutrophil adhesion molecules."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the positive ANA and anti-double-stranded DNA levels confirm the diagnosis. Prednisone therapy is commonly used in SLE treatment. The CBC on admission showed a low hemoglobin level and low eosinophil count, indicating anemia and lack of allergic reaction. Two weeks later, the CBC showed increased leukocyte count, increased neutrophil count, and no eosinophils or basophils. This suggests an acute inflammation or infection, and since the patient\u2019s symptoms have improved with prednisone therapy, it is most likely due to downregulation of neutrophil adhesion molecules."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, leukocytosis, and positive ANA and anti-double-stranded DNA levels suggest the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Prednisone therapy is commonly used to treat SLE. The change in the CBC from admission to 2 weeks later suggests downregulation of neutrophil adhesion molecules, as the percentage of neutrophils increased while lymphocytes decreased, indicating a shift in the balance of immune cells. This is a common effect seen with corticosteroid therapy."

Prednisone therapy may cause downregulation of neutrophil adhesion molecules, which can result in an increase in the number of circulating neutrophils. This explains the increase in neutrophils and decrease in lymphocytes seen in the second CBC compared to the first. Upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules in the endothelium is not relevant to this case. Apoptosis of neutrophils and redistribution of neutrophils in the lymph nodes are not likely explanations for the changes in the CBC."

SLE can cause pleural effusion and joint pain. Prednisone therapy is commonly used to treat SLE. Looking at the CBC results, the leukocyte count increased from 8,000/mm3 to 13,000/mm3, and the neutrophils increased from 60% to 90%. This suggests that there was an upregulation of neutrophil adhesion molecules, leading to an increase in circulating neutrophils and subsequent inflammation. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) downregulation of neutrophil adhesion molecules."

The patient\u2019s symptoms and positive ANA and anti-double-stranded DNA levels suggest systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The difference in the CBCs is likely due to downregulation of neutrophil adhesion molecules as a result of the prednisone therapy, which reduces inflammation and suppresses the immune system. This leads to a decrease in neutrophil migration to the site of inflammation and a decrease in the percentage of lymphocytes, which are also suppressed by prednisone. The other options do not seem to be relevant to the case."

The patient\u2019s positive ANA and anti-double-stranded DNA levels, along with the rash and pleural effusion, suggest that the most likely diagnosis is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The increase in neutrophils and decrease in lymphocytes suggest that the prednisone therapy is having an effect on the patient\u2019s immune system. Downregulation of neutrophil adhesion molecules allows for the migration of neutrophils out of the circulation and into tissues, which may account for the increase in neutrophil count."

The patient has symptoms suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including pleurisy, rash, and positive ANA and anti-dsDNA antibodies. Treatment with prednisone resulted in an increase in neutrophil count, which suggests downregulation of neutrophil adhesion molecules. Neutrophil adhesion molecules are involved in neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow, and downregulation of these molecules can increase neutrophil counts in the peripheral blood. Upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules in the endothelium, apoptosis of neutrophils, and redistribution of neutrophils in the lymph nodes are unlikely to explain the increase in neutrophil count."
