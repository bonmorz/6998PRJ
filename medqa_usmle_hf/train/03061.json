The patient presents with sudden onset of pain, tingling sensation, and weakness in his right leg, with absent pedal pulses on the right. These symptoms are indicative of arterial embolism, which can occur from a blood clot or plaque dislodged from atherosclerotic plaque in the arterial wall. The fact that the patient has no history of claudication suggests that there was no previous decrease in blood flow to the leg due to atherosclerotic narrowing of the artery. Arterial vasospasm is less likely to cause sudden onset of symptoms, while popliteal artery aneurysm typically presents with a pulsatile mass in the popliteal fossa."
