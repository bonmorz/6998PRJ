Eplerenone is a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist and is the best next step in management. Surgical excision may also be necessary in some cases, but it is not the first-line treatment. Hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone are not indicated in this case as they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms."

Surgical excision may also be an option, but medication should be tried first. Hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone are not appropriate choices in this situation."

The low potassium level suggests hyperaldosteronism, which can cause hypertension and can be treated with aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or eplerenone. However, spironolactone has the side effect of gynecomastia, which the patient is already experiencing, making eplerenone a better choice. Surgical excision may be an option but is not the best next step before attempting medical management. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and may exacerbate the low potassium levels."

The hemoglobin and hematocrit levels suggest that the patient may have polycythemia vera, which can cause a ruddy complexion and increased risk for thrombotic events. The low potassium level can be a side effect of diuretic use, but the patient is not currently taking any diuretics. The abnormal abdominal masses suggest the presence of renal cell carcinoma, which can cause secondary hypertension through excess renin production. Eplerenone is a medication that can help decrease hypertension in patients with excess aldosterone production without causing potassium loss, and may be an appropriate initial therapy in this patient. Surgical excision may ultimately be necessary but would not be the next step in management."

The laboratory results show hypokalemia and elevated serum creatinine, suggesting renal impairment. The CT scan shows bilateral abnormal abdominal masses, likely adrenal tumors. Given the patient\u2019s symptoms and laboratory findings, the best next step in management would be to treat the underlying cause with medication, specifically eplerenone, which is a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist and can help lower blood pressure and improve renal function, without the risk of significant potassium loss. Surgical excision may be an option in some cases, but would not be the best initial step in management. Hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone may be used to treat hypertension, but would not address the underlying cause of the abdominal masses."
