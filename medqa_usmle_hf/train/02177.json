After the first wave of cases, there were 4,960 susceptible people remaining (5,000 total population minus the 40 initial cases). From these susceptible people, 90 new cases were reported 10 days later, bringing the total number of cases to 130. This means that the secondary attack rate for the first wave was (90/4960) x 100 = 1.81%. \n\nAfter a month, a total of 984 new cases (1024 - 40 initial cases) were reported, which means that there were 4,016 susceptible people remaining. From these susceptible people, an additional 25 cases were reported, bringing the total number of cases to 155. This means that the secondary attack rate for the second wave was (25/4016) x 100 = 0.62%. \n\nThe overall secondary attack rate can be calculated by adding the number of new cases from both waves (90 + 25 = 115) and dividing by the total number of susceptible people (150 + 4016 = 4166). This gives a secondary attack rate of (115/4166) x 100 = 2.76%. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) (90/110) x 100."

The number of susceptible individuals is the total population of 5,000 minus the 40 primary cases, minus any individuals who developed the disease and recovered during the outbreak. We do not have information about the latter, but we know that the total number of cases reported after a month is 1,024, which includes all primary and secondary cases, so we can subtract the primary cases from this number: 1,024 - 40 = 984. However, we also know that 150 individuals lived in the households of the primary cases, and we do not know if any of them were infected, so we must subtract them as well: 984 - 150 = 834.

In the first wave of the infection, 40 people from 40 different households (out of a total of 150 people in these households) developed the disease. This gives us a attack rate of (40/150) \u00d7 100 = 26.67%.\n\nIn the second wave, 90 new cases were reported from the same households. We know that the total number of cases after 10 days is the sum of the first and second wave, so the total number of cases after 10 days is 40 + 90 = 130. This means that the attack rate for the second wave is (90/110) \u00d7 100 = 81.82% (since 110 people were still susceptible after the first wave).\n\nFinally, 25 more cases were reported after a month, bringing the total number of cases to 1,024. We can subtract the 130 cases from the first and second wave to get the number of cases that developed after a month: 1,024 - 130 = 894.\n\nSo, the secondary attack rate for this infection is (25/110) \u00d7 100 = 22.73%. This is because out of the 110 people who were still susceptible after the first and second wave, 25 developed the disease after a month. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) (90/110) \u00d7 100."
