Since the dog's behavior seemed normal after the incident and the boy has fed the dog multiple times without incident, it is unlikely that the dog has rabies. The wound is also relatively minor.

If the dog remains well after the 10-day observation period, the risk of rabies transmission is low and no further treatment is needed. If the dog becomes ill during the observation period, then the boy should receive post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies."
