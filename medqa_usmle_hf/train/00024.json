The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), which is characterized by photosensitive skin blisters and dark urine. In PCT, there is an excess buildup of porphyrins in the liver, which is the result of an inherited or acquired enzyme deficiency. The most effective treatment is phlebotomy therapy, which removes iron and reduces porphyrin buildup. Liver transplantation is not indicated unless the disease progresses to liver failure. Thalidomide and hydroxychloroquine have not been shown to be effective in treating PCT."
