The patient has been consistently taking the combined oral contraceptive and her acne and dysmenorrhea have improved, suggesting that the weight gain is not due to the medication. She has also increased her exercise regimen and started college, which could have contributed to the weight gain. A serum TSH level or low-dose dexamethasone suppression test would be inappropriate in this case since there are no other clinical signs or symptoms of thyroid or adrenal dysfunction. Switching to a non-hormonal contraceptive method would not address the weight gain issue. Therefore, reassuring the patient and monitoring her weight over time would be the most appropriate next step in management."

The patient has been taking the combined oral contraceptive consistently and has experienced improvement in dysmenorrhea and acne. She also increased her exercise regimen, which could contribute to weight gain in the form of muscle mass. There have been no changes in her sleep or energy levels, which suggests that there is no underlying endocrine issue. Therefore, reassurance is the most appropriate next step in management. It is not necessary to measure serum TSH levels or perform a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test because there are no indications that suggest thyroid or adrenal dysfunction. Switching to a non-hormonal contraceptive method is also not necessary as the patient has been doing well on her current medication."
