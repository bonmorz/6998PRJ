The pathogenesis described with invasion of the thyroid capsule and blood vessels, along with the fine-needle aspiration biopsy showing cuboidal cells arranged around colloid, suggests a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The PAX8-PPAR gamma gene rearrangement is seen in up to 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas, making it the most likely answer choice. The other mutations are associated with other types of thyroid cancers."
