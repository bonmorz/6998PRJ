The patient has symptoms of hypocalcemia, which can occur after total thyroidectomy due to injury or removal of parathyroid glands.

PTH is decreased in hypoparathyroidism, which can occur after removal of parathyroid glands, and serum calcium and phosphate levels are also decreased. Therefore, the correct answer is (D)."
