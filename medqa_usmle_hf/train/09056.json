The sensory and motor deficits are most likely to be paresis and numbness of the medial thigh and medial side of the calf, and weak hip flexion and knee extension. This is due to injury to the obturator nerve, which runs through the pelvis and along the medial aspect of the femur, and is often damaged in anterior hip dislocations. Option (B) refers to injury to the obturator nerve, but only presents numbness and inability to adduct the thigh without weakness. Option (C) refers to injury to the ilioinguinal nerve, which is not likely in this case. Option (D) refers to injury to the sciatic nerve, which is not likely in anterior hip dislocations."

The hip flexor (iliopsoas) and knee extensor (quadriceps) muscles may be injured due to the dislocation and fracture, leading to paresis and weakness. The medial thigh and medial side of the calf are supplied by the femoral nerve, which may also be injured during the trauma. This matches option A. Option B describes the obturator nerve, which is responsible for hip adduction and sensory innervation of the medial thigh. Option C describes the genitofemoral nerve, which supplies the skin of the scrotum and upper medial thigh. Option D describes injury to the common peroneal nerve, which supplies the muscles of the lower leg and dorsum of the foot, leading to foot drop and sensory loss in specific areas."

The right anterior hip dislocation indicated involvement of the obturator nerve, which innervates the medial thigh and medial calf, resulting in paresis and numbness. Weakness of hip flexion and knee extension suggests involvement of the femoral nerve, which also innervates the muscles. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. Option (B) describes sensory and motor deficits associated with obturator nerve injury but not femoral nerve injury. Option (C) describes sensory deficits associated with ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve injury but not femoral nerve injury. Option (D) describes sensory and motor deficits associated with common peroneal nerve injury but not femoral nerve injury."

The other options refer to nerves that are not likely to be affected by the specific injury described."
