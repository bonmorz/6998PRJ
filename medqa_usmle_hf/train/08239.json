Breast milk provides optimal nutrition for infants, but it may not supply sufficient amounts of vitamin K and vitamin D. Therefore, both vitamin K and vitamin D supplementation are recommended for breastfed newborns. Vitamin K supplementation is particularly important to prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Vitamin D supplementation is important for bone health and can prevent rickets. It is important to note that this recommendation may vary depending on location, season, and other factors, so it is best to consult with a healthcare provider for individualized recommendations. Folic acid is not typically recommended for newborns but is important for pregnant women to take to prevent birth defects."

All breastfed newborns should receive a vitamin D supplement of 400 IU per day starting from the first few days of life and continuing until the infant is weaned and consumes adequate amounts of vitamin D-fortified formula or milk. Infants who are exclusively breastfed and who do not receive vitamin D supplementation are at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, which can lead to rickets and other health problems. Vitamin K is also important to prevent bleeding disorders and is routinely given to newborns. Formula-fed infants receive adequate vitamin K from formula, but breastfed infants should receive a single dose of vitamin K at birth or within the first week of life. Folic acid is not routinely given to newborns but is important for pregnant women to take to reduce the risk of birth defects. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Vitamin K and Vitamin D."
