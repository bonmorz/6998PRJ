The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a stroke and a medication, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), should be administered immediately to dissolve the clot and improve outcomes. However, if the patient\u2019s condition becomes significantly worse and new deficits are found, tPA may no longer be an appropriate option. Instead, aminocaproic acid, which can help prevent bleeding and clot breakdown, may be used. Antivenin is used to treat venomous bites or stings, plasma transfusion is used to replace blood components or treat coagulation disorders, and protamine sulfate is used to reverse the effects of heparin. None of these options are appropriate for a stroke patient."
