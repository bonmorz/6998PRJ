The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest that he may have developed antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be caused by Clostridium difficile infection. The pathogenic mechanism of Clostridium difficile involves the production of toxins that can modify or inactivate host cell proteins, including the glucosylation of Rho family GTPases. This can lead to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and ultimately cell death, resulting in the symptoms observed in this patient. Options B, C, and D are not associated with the pathogenic mechanism of Clostridium difficile infection."

The fact that the patient had recently taken clindamycin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that can disrupt the normal gut flora, increases the likelihood of CDI. CDI is caused by the release of toxins A and B, which are produced by Clostridium difficile. These toxins cause inflammation of the colon, resulting in diarrhea and abdominal pain. Toxin B is responsible for glucosylation of Rho family GTPases, which ultimately leads to cell death and inflammation. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer. Inactivation of elongation factor EF-2 is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ADP-ribosylation of Gs-alpha subunit of G-protein coupled receptors is caused by Vibrio cholerae, and cell membrane degradation by lecithinase is caused by Clostridium perfringens."
