The symptoms of muscle pain and fever following consumption of bear meat suggest Trichinosis, which is caused by the parasite Trichinella spiralis. The eosinophilia indicates an allergic response, which is mediated by antibodies and eosinophils. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity involves the activation of eosinophils by IgE antibodies and release of major basic protein, which causes tissue inflammation and damage. Therefore, the most likely answer is (D) Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The other options are not related to the mechanism of allergic response."
