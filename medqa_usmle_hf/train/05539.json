The excessive GH can cause thickening of the heart muscle, increased risk of coronary artery disease, and prolongation of the QT interval, but it is most likely to result in reduced cardiac output due to the increased workload on the heart. Deposition of mucopolysaccharides is associated with Hurler syndrome, and thickening of coronary artery walls is associated with atherosclerosis."

Growth hormone can cause thickening of the heart muscle and increased risk of arrhythmias, but the most likely sequela is reduced cardiac output due to the heart having to work harder to pump blood through the enlarged blood vessels and thickened heart muscle. Therefore, the correct answer is (D). Deposition of mucopolysaccharides in the myocardium is seen in patients with Hurler syndrome, and thickening of the coronary artery walls is associated with atherosclerosis."

Prolongation of the QT interval on ECG can be a result of electrolyte imbalances, but not specifically associated with acromegaly."
