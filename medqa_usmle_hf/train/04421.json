The patient has signs and symptoms of a ruptured spleen or liver injury, such as abdominal pain, tenderness, rebound and guarding, and hyperresonance to percussion in the epigastric region. The absence of hepatic dullness and free fluid in the pelvic region also support this diagnosis. The narrow pulse pressure suggests hypovolemia, which is confirmed by the patient's hemodynamics not improving with aggressive fluid resuscitation. CT scan is not the next best step as the patient is unstable and needs urgent intervention. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is an outdated technique and has been largely replaced by imaging modalities such as CT scan and ultrasound. Emergency laparotomy is the best next step as it allows for definitive diagnosis and treatment of the patient's condition. Emergency laparoscopy may be an option in some cases, but may not be feasible in the presence of large amounts of free fluid or air in the abdominal cavity."

The patient has signs of abdominal trauma, including abdominal pain, tenderness, and distension; narrow pulse pressure; hyperresonance in the epigastric region and absence of hepatic dullness in the right upper quadrant; bloody contents in the nasogastric tube; and free fluid in the pelvic region on FAST. These signs suggest intra-abdominal bleeding, likely from visceral or vascular damage, and the patient is in shock despite fluid resuscitation. CT scan or laparoscopy may not provide sufficient information to identify and treat the source of bleeding, and DPL is invasive and carries a risk of complications. Therefore, emergency laparotomy is the most appropriate next step to achieve hemostasis and control the bleeding."
