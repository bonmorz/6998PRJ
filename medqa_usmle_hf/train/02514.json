The patient\u2019s symptoms and history suggest a possible gallbladder disorder, and the hormone responsible for this pain is most likely cholecystokinin (CCK), which promotes the contraction of the gallbladder and relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi. Option A is incorrect because CCK decreases pancreatic bicarbonate secretion. Option B is incorrect because CCK promotes gallbladder contraction, not relaxation. Option C is incorrect because CCK does not promote migrating motor complexes."
