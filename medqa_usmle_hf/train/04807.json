The patient's recent bout of optic neuritis, pulmonary sarcoidosis, hypertension, and right-sided facial droop suggest a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Heparin and plasmapheresis are not indicated in the management of MS."

The patient\u2019s medical history suggests that she may have neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or multiple sclerosis (MS), which can cause episodes of blurry vision and dizziness. The recent optic neuritis episode and possible facial droop also suggest these diagnoses. MRI would be helpful in diagnosing and differentiating between NMO and MS. Treatment typically involves high-dose IV methylprednisolone followed by maintenance therapy with a disease-modifying drug such as methotrexate. Heparin and plasmapheresis are not indicated in this case."

The patient\u2019s symptoms and history of sarcoidosis and acute optic neuritis suggest a possible diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica. High-dose IV methylprednisolone is used to treat acute attacks, while methotrexate can be used for maintenance therapy to prevent further attacks. Therefore, option B, Methylprednisolone and methotrexate, is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. Heparin and plasmapheresis are not typically used in the treatment of neuromyelitis optica."

The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS), including acute optic neuritis, dizziness, and disorientation. The recent use of IV methylprednisolone also supports the diagnosis. The right-sided facial droop may indicate a new or worsening lesion in the brainstem. The most appropriate next step in management would be to initiate therapy with high-dose IV methylprednisolone and add methotrexate to reduce the risk of future exacerbations. Heparin is not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of thrombotic disease. Plasmapheresis may be considered in severe cases of MS or when patients do not respond to steroid therapy. However, it is not the first-line treatment for a patient with a new onset of MS symptoms like this."
