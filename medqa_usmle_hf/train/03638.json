The patient is presenting with hereditary angioedema (HAE), which is characterized by recurrent swelling episodes due to low levels of C1 inhibitor. ACE inhibitors, such as fosinopril, can increase bradykinin levels and exacerbate symptoms of HAE. Therefore, fosinopril is contraindicated in this patient. Amlodipine, valsartan, and atenolol are not known to exacerbate HAE symptoms and can be considered for blood pressure control."
