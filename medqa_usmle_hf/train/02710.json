Spironolactone competitively binds to aldosterone receptors and reduces fluid volume, making it the most likely drug prescribed to this patient. Amiloride also reduces fluid volume, but it does not bind to aldosterone receptors. Atorvastatin is a statin used to lower cholesterol levels and has no effect on fluid volume. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that also reduces fluid volume, but it acts on the ascending loop of Henle in the kidney, not aldosterone receptors."

Amiloride also works as a diuretic by blocking Na+ channels but does not specifically target aldosterone receptors.
