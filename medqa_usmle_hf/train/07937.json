Among the options, the most useful laboratory test to include in the evaluation is thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) levels. TSH levels will help determine if there is a problem with the thyroid gland, while free T4 levels will help determine the severity of the hyperthyroidism."
