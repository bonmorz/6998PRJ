The provided photograph shows a white, raised lesion which is consistent with oral thrush, a fungal infection caused by Candida albicans. Leukoplakia usually presents as thick, white patches on the tongue, gums, or cheeks, but is usually painless. Primary gingivostomatitis is a viral infection caused by herpes simplex virus, and would be associated with other symptoms such as fever or sore throat. Oral hairy leukoplakia is usually seen in immunocompromised patients and presents with white, corrugated lesions on the lateral aspect of the tongue."
