Open reduction internal fixation and TPN may be necessary for the patient's fractures and nutritional needs, but administering a pneumococcal vaccine is the most important intervention in this case."

The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy for a lacerated spleen, and this puts him at risk for encapsulated bacterial infections like pneumococcal disease. Therefore, administering the pneumococcal vaccine would be appropriate as a preventative measure. Prophylactic ceftriaxone may be given in some cases to prevent surgical site infections or infections in patients with a weakened immune system. Open reduction internal fixation may be used to treat the fractures, but it is not necessary for immediate administration. TPN may be used if the patient cannot tolerate oral or enteral nutrition, but it is not necessary in this case as the patient's injuries do not suggest significant gastrointestinal dysfunction."
