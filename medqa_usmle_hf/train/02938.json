The patient\u2019s occupation as a babysitter and exposure to a child with chickenpox puts her at risk for varicella infection, but the vaccine is contraindicated in pregnancy.

Hepatitis B vaccine is typically given to newborns and is not necessary for this patient at this time. The intramuscular flu vaccine is recommended for all pregnant women, regardless of gestational age, to protect both the mother and fetus."

Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis vaccine would be recommended only in the third trimester. That leaves us with option D, which is the intramuscular flu vaccine. The patient is at increased risk of contracting the flu due to her exposure to sick children and should receive the flu vaccine to protect herself and her developing fetus."
