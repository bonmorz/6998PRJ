The question describes a synapse that involves the release of neurotransmitters from small vesicles with dense cores, which is characteristic of adrenergic synapses. Epinephrine is the major neurotransmitter released by adrenergic synapses, making it the most likely option. Follicle stimulating hormone is not a neurotransmitter, GABA is released from vesicles with clear cores, and glutamate is released from vesicles with flattened, pleiomorphic cores."
