The transverse tubules in skeletal muscle cells are responsible for the rapid conduction of action potentials into the interior of the muscle cell, leading to the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the subsequent formation of cross-bridges between actin and myosin filaments. Therefore, the most likely associated finding with the absence of consistent density of transverse tubules is impaired synchronization of cross-bridge formation, as this process relies on the rapid and coordinated release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Decreased entry of calcium at the presynaptic membrane (option A) is not related to the function of transverse tubules. Decreased expression of sarcolemmal Na+/K+ ATPase (option B) is also not related to transverse tubules. Impaired binding of acetylcholine to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (option D) is related to neuromuscular junction function, which is not directly affected by the absence of consistent density of transverse tubules in skeletal muscle cells."
