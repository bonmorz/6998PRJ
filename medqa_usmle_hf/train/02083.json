The patient's symptoms include hearing voices and a lack of motivation, which are common in schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. However, her depressive symptoms suggest that she may have schizoaffective disorder, which combines symptoms of schizophrenia with a mood disorder. The brief duration of her symptoms would not be enough to diagnose schizophrenia or delusional disorder, and her symptoms are not limited to delusions, as in the case of delusional disorder."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including hearing voices, insomnia, unintentional weight loss, feeling sad and worthless, and the desire to harm others indicate a psychotic disorder. Among the options, schizoaffective disorder fits the symptoms the most, as it involves both mood symptoms (feeling sad and worthless) and psychotic symptoms (hearing voices and delusions). Delusional disorder involves non-bizarre delusions without other psychotic symptoms, while Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by an episode of psychotic symptoms that last less than one month. Schizophrenia involves symptoms lasting at least 6 months with significant impairment of multiple domains of functioning."

There are multiple symptoms that suggest a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, including psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), mood symptoms (depression), and a history of a significant change in behavior. Schizophrenia can also present with similar symptoms, but the presence of mood symptoms over a period of time suggests a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder rather than schizophrenia. Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by symptoms lasting less than 1 month, which does not apply to this case. Delusional disorder involves nonbizarre delusions, but in this case, the patient is experiencing hallucinations as well as delusions."
