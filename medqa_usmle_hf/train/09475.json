The new combination drug regimen containing an agent that binds to glycoprotein 41 is most likely targeting viral fusion and entry into host cells, as this glycoprotein plays a key role in viral entry. Inhibition of viral docking and attachment would require targeting other viral surface proteins, while viral genome transcription and particle assembly occur after viral entry into host cells. Increased viral load despite ongoing treatment suggests that the virus has developed resistance to the previous treatment, necessitating the switch to a new combination drug regimen."
