The patient's presentation of vomiting and hypotension are seen in Mallory-Weiss tears, which occur from forceful retching or vomiting. A tear involving the mucosa and submucosa of the gastroesophageal junction, as seen in the endoscopy, is consistent with Mallory-Weiss tear. Boerhaave syndrome is a complete rupture of the esophagus and is unlikely in this case as the tear is only involving the mucosa and submucosa. Gastric ulcer and hiatal hernia may cause epigastric tenderness, but they wouldn't result in a tear at the gastroesophageal junction."
