The patient is presenting with symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

However, the question specifically asks for the most appropriate next step in management, which is the addition of doxylamine. Doxylamine is an antihistamine commonly used for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and has been found to be effective for hyperemesis gravidarum. IV fluid resuscitation may still be necessary, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case."

IV fluid resuscitation or supplemental oxygen may be needed in severe cases, but the patient's vital signs and orthostatic testing are currently within normal limits. Monitoring and stress counseling may be helpful in managing the patient's psychological distress, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management for her physical symptoms."
