Azotemia is a condition in which there is an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating impaired kidney function. Hyperkalemia, or high levels of potassium in the blood, can cause weakness, palpitations, and tall-peaked T waves on ECG. This can occur as a result of acute kidney injury from the contrast medium reaction. Uremic pericarditis can also occur in acute kidney injury, but it is unlikely to present with tall-peaked T waves. Anemia and platelet dysfunction do not explain the clinical manifestation of this scenario."
