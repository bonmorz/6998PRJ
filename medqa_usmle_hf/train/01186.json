FFP contains clotting factors and is the most appropriate choice to correct the coagulopathy. Cryoprecipitate contains fibrinogen, which may help with clot formation, but FFP is more appropriate for correcting coagulopathy caused by warfarin use. Intravenous vitamin K will help reverse the anticoagulant effect, but is not the best choice in a bleeding emergency. Platelets are not indicated in this case as the patient's bleeding is likely due to a warfarin-induced coagulopathy rather than a platelet disorder."

The combination of bleeding, history of warfarin use, and elevated INR suggest that the underlying coagulopathy is due to warfarin. The next best step to correct this is to give fresh frozen plasma, which contains clotting factors needed to reverse the effects of warfarin. Cryoprecipitate provides clotting factors VIII and XIII and fibrinogen, which are not affected by warfarin. Vitamin K takes time to work and is not a quick reversal agent. Platelets are not effective in correcting coagulopathy due to warfarin use."

Treatment for elevated INR depends on the degree of bleeding and INR level. In this case, there is significant bleeding and the INR is only slightly elevated. The best initial treatment is FFP which replaces clotting factors. Cryoprecipitate is used for clotting factor deficiencies and platelets are used in platelet deficiencies.
