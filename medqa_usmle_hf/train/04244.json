Based on the symptoms, laboratory results, and autopsy findings, the most likely cause is bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The peripheral smear image shows Howell-Jolly bodies, which are associated with hyposplenism, a risk factor for pneumococcal infections. Neisseria meningitidis can cause a similar clinical picture but would typically present with signs of meningeal irritation. The other options are less likely causes of this presentation."

The patient\u2019s symptoms and the peripheral smear showing Howell-Jolly bodies suggest severe sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The gram stain from the autopsy is also consistent with S. pneumoniae. Staphylococcus aureus can cause pneumonia but is less likely to result in disseminated intravascular coagulation. Neisseria meningitidis usually presents with meningeal symptoms and a petechial rash, which are not mentioned in the case scenario. Non-typeable H. influenzae is typically associated with respiratory infections and otitis media in children."

Among the options, only Streptococcus pneumoniae causes both sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The gram stain proves this diagnosis."
