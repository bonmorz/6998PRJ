The abnormal serum studies suggest a potential risk for fetal abnormalities, and the most appropriate next step in management is to perform amniocentesis to sample the amniotic fluid for further testing. Cell-free fetal DNA testing is an option, but it may not provide as comprehensive information. Chorionic villus sampling is not typically performed after 15 weeks' gestation. Pelvic ultrasound may provide some information, but not definitive diagnosis of fetal abnormalities."
