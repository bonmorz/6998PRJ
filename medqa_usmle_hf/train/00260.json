The injury occurred during football when the finger got caught in the jersey and was forcefully pulled away, which is a mechanism commonly associated with this injury. The inability to flex the distal interphalangeal joint also supports this diagnosis. Closed fracture of the distal phalanx or slipping of the central band of the extensor digitorum tendon would not cause the inability to flex the distal interphalangeal joint. Inflammation of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon sheath may cause pain and swelling in the affected finger, but it would not result in the inability to flex the distal interphalangeal joint."

Inflammation of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon sheath would involve pain with tendon movement but not necessarily a loss of ability to flex. Slipping of the central band of the extensor digitorum tendon would lead to a mallet finger deformity with inability to extend the fingertip."
