The increased anxiety and hallucinations suggest that the current treatment may not be sufficient. Among the options, ziprasidone is a second-generation antipsychotic that is used to treat schizophrenia and can also help with anxiety and agitation. Chlorpromazine is a first-generation antipsychotic that may not be as effective for the patient's symptoms. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant and may not be the best option for anxiety and psychosis. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine and may help with anxiety but does not address the underlying schizophrenia."
