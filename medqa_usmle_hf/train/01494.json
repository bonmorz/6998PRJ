Option (C) is a normal blood chemistry for someone without diabetes, while (A) and (D) cannot occur simultaneously as high insulin levels should lead to low glucose levels."

In this case, the patient likely injected a fatal dose of lispro to commit suicide. Option (B) is the correct answer because a high insulin level and absent C-peptide level suggest exogenous insulin injection rather than endogenous insulin production. The low glucose level is likely due to the actions of the insulin. Options (A) and (D) are incorrect because they both suggest high insulin and C-peptide levels, which would not be seen with exogenous insulin injection. Option (C) is incorrect because it suggests low insulin and C-peptide levels, which would not be expected in a type 1 diabetic patient."
