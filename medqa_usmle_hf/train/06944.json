Malathion is an organophosphate, which inhibits acetylcholinesterase, leading to accumulation of acetylcholine and symptoms of cholinergic toxicity, such as confusion, lacrimation, salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The inhibition is irreversible as malathion forms covalent bonds with the enzyme. Vmax is decreased in affected patients. Malathion does not activate the enzyme responsible for acetylcholine breakdown but instead inhibits it. Therefore, the correct answer is (C)."

Malathion is an organophosphate insecticide that irreversibly inhibits acetylcholinesterase by forming covalent bonds with the enzyme. This inhibition leads to an accumulation of acetylcholine, which causes the symptoms described in the patient. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. Options (A) and (B) are incorrect because malathion-induced acetylcholinesterase inhibition is irreversible and affects both the Vmax and the Km of the enzyme. Option (D) is also incorrect because malathion does not activate acetylcholinesterase but inhibits its breakdown of acetylcholine."

The presentation of the patient (cholinergic symptoms, decreased heart sounds, and wheezes) suggests organophosphate toxicity. The mechanism of action of organophosphates such as malathion is irreversible enzyme inhibition through the formation of strong covalent bonds between the pesticide and the enzyme responsible for acetylcholine breakdown. This leads to cholinergic excess with symptoms such as those presented by the patient. Option A is incorrect since the enzyme inhibition is irreversible. Option B is incorrect since Vmax is decreased in enzyme inhibition. Option D is incorrect as malathion does not activate the enzyme responsible for acetylcholine breakdown."
