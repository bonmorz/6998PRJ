While Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia are both possible diagnoses for memory difficulty, the patient's history and symptoms suggest depression as the most likely cause. The recent decrease in mood since the patient's husband died, along with feelings of heaviness in limbs, fit with symptoms of depression. The patient's age and lack of significant findings on neurological exam make Alzheimer's disease less likely. Hypothyroidism could also cause memory difficulty, but there are no other symptoms or physical exam findings to support this diagnosis."

The fact that the memory loss is recent and the patient was previously fully functional also supports the diagnosis of depression. Hypothyroidism is another possibility, but there are no symptoms or physical exam findings suggestive of this diagnosis."
