Impaired bradykinin degradation is also a possible cause of captopril-induced rash but it does not fit the patient\u2019s symptoms. Options A and B do not fit with the patient\u2019s presentation."

Therefore, impaired bradykinin degradation is the most likely explanation for this patient's skin findings."

The symptoms described are consistent with cutaneous mast cell activation, which is a common manifestation of allergic reactions. Option A is incorrect because epidermal keratinocyte hyperproliferation is associated with psoriasis, not an allergic reaction. Option B is incorrect because Cutaneous Trichophyton rubrum infection would not typically present with an itchy rash."
