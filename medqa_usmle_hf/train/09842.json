However, since the blue section appears to cover roughly half of the total distribution, we can estimate that the number of patients in the blue section is approximately half of the total sample size, or 125 patients. Therefore, the answer is (A)."

However, we can estimate that approximately 50% of the patients fall to the left of the mean, and an additional 35% fall within one standard deviation to the left of the mean. Therefore, approximately 85% of patients (0.85 x 250 = 212.5) fall to the left of the blue highlighted area. This means that approximately 125 patients (250 - 212.5 = 37.5, rounded to 38; 212.5 - 38 = 174.5, rounded to 175; 175 - 50 = 125) fall within the blue highlighted area.

According to this rule, approximately one-third of the data falls within one standard deviation (SD) of the mean, two-thirds fall within two SDs, and almost all (about 99.7%) fall within three SDs. In Image A, the blue portion highlights the range between -1 and 1 SD from the mean, which is roughly one-third of the distribution. Since there are 250 patients in total, we can estimate that there are approximately 125 patients in the blue portion. Therefore, the correct answer is (A)."
