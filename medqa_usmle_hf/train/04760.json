Menopause is associated with decreased estrogen, decreased inhibin B, and increased follicle-stimulating hormone levels due to the loss of ovarian function. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone levels are not typically impacted by menopause. Therefore, the most likely change to occur in this patient's condition is increased follicle-stimulating hormone levels."

Option A is incorrect because estrogen levels decrease during menopause. Option B is incorrect because inhibin B is also decreased during menopause. Option C is incorrect because gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) levels fluctuate during perimenopause but overall decrease during menopause."

Decreased estrogen levels would be expected, leading to symptoms such as vaginal atrophy and irregular cycles. As a result, there would be a decrease in inhibition of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to increased levels of FSH. Therefore, the most likely change in this patient's condition would be an increase in FSH."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a menopausal transition, which is often marked by irregular menstrual cycles, vulvovaginal atrophy, and hot flashes. During this transition, there is a decrease in estrogen levels, which stimulates an increase in follicle-stimulating hormone levels as the body tries to compensate for the decreased estrogen production. Inhibin B levels also decrease during this time. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone levels may fluctuate but are not typically decreased during this transition. Therefore, the most likely change in this patient\u2019s condition is an increase in follicle-stimulating hormone levels as a result of decreased estrogen production."
