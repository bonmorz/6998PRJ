Since the incidence of the disease X is 1 in 25, the carrier frequency is 2/25, which means that q is equal to the square root of 2/25 or approximately 0.28. Therefore, the probability of both parents being carriers is 0.28 x 0.28, or approximately 0.078. The probability of having a child with the disease X is the probability of both parents passing on the recessive allele, which is q^2, or approximately 0.078. Simplifying this fraction, we get 1/4 as the answer, choice (A)."

We know that the incidence of the disease is 1 in 25, so the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 1/5. Since both parents are carriers, they each have one copy of the recessive allele, so their genotype is Hh (where H represents the dominant allele). The probability of each parent passing on the recessive allele is 1/2. Using a Punnett square or the rules of probability, we can see that the probability of their child inheriting two recessive alleles and expressing the disease (hh) is 1/4.

In this scenario, the incidence of the disease X is 1 in 25, which means that the carrier frequency is 2 in 25 (since it is an autosomal recessive disease). Using the Hardy Weinberg equation, we can calculate the probability of having a child with the disease: p^2 (the probability of having a homozygous affected child) = 1/625, 2pq (the probability of having a heterozygous carrier child) = 2/25, and q^2 (the probability of having a homozygous unaffected child) = 21/25. Since both parents are carriers, their genotype would be Aa. The probability of passing on the recessive allele to their offspring would be 1/2. Therefore the probability of having a child expressing the disease would be 1/4 (p^2 x 1/2)."

                "content": "We use the formula for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium: p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1. Let X be the recessive allele and x be the dominant allele. The frequency of the X allele (q) is 1/5 since the incidence of the disease is 1 in 25, and q^2 = 1/25. The frequency of the dominant allele (p) is 1 - q = 4/5. Both parents are carriers, so their genotype is Xx. The probability of each parent passing on the X allele is 1/2. To calculate the probability of their child expressing the disease, we need to consider the genotype of the child. There are three possible genotypes: XX, Xx, and xx. The only genotype that expresses the disease is xx. The probability of the child inheriting an X allele from each parent (either XX or Xx) is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. The probability of the child being xx is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. However, we need to add the probability of the child being Xx, since carriers can pass on the disease allele. The probability of the child being Xx is (1/4) * (1/2) + (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/4. So the total probability of the child expressing the disease is 1/16 + 1/4 = 5/16. However, the question asks for the probability that a carrier couple will have a child expressing the disease, so we need to divide the probability by 4 (since there are 4 possible child genotypes): 5/16 / 4 = 1/4. Therefore, the answer is (A) 1/4."
