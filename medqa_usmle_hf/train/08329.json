The patient's history of alcohol use disorder, joint pain, and oral examination findings suggest a deficiency in vitamin C, which is necessary for the hydroxylation of lysine residues in collagen synthesis. This results in weakened blood vessels and the spontaneous bruising seen in the patient's legs. Conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is involved in energy production, gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues is involved in vitamin K dependent clotting factors, and intestinal absorption of Ca2+ and PO43- is involved in calcium homeostasis. None of these processes are directly related to the patient's symptoms."
