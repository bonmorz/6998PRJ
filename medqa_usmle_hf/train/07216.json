The orange/red hue of the eyes suggests that the drug responsible is most likely isoniazid, which inhibits RNA polymerase. This can lead to an accumulation of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), which can cause ocular toxicity. Arabinosyltransferase is inhibited by ethambutol, mycolic acid synthesis is inhibited by isoniazid and rifampin, and squalene epoxidase is inhibited by terbinafine."

The orange/red hue in the eyes is a well-known side effect of isoniazid, which is part of the standard four-drug treatment regimen for tuberculosis. Isoniazid works by inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis, but it is metabolized by the liver, where it is converted to a toxic intermediate that can cause liver damage and also interact with melanin, leading to the discoloration of the eyes. However, none of the answer choices mentioned liver damage or melanin interaction. Instead, option A, inhibition of RNA polymerase, is a plausible mechanism of action for isoniazid, as it can inhibit bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is necessary for transcription and protein synthesis in bacterial cells."
