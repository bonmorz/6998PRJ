The blisters on the abdomen, anterior chest, and anterior and posterior aspects of the right upper extremity and right thigh suggest that these areas have been affected by 2nd-degree burns. The skin over the left thigh is not affected by burns, so it can be excluded from the calculation. A rough estimation of the affected body surface area can be done using the Rule of Nines, which divides the body into areas of 9%. Based on the description of the affected areas, the closest approximation would be 36% (9% for each arm, 18% for the trunk, 9% for each leg)."

According to this method, the anterior trunk accounts for 18% and the posterior trunk accounts for 18% of the body surface area. Each upper limb accounts for 9%, and each lower limb accounts for 18%. Therefore, the right upper limb and thigh (9% + 18% = 27%) and the anterior chest and abdomen (18%) together add up to 45%. Since only some areas on the right side are affected and the left side is unaffected, we can estimate that approximately half of the affected area is burned, making it closer to 36% (45% \u00f7 2 = 22.5% for the affected area, plus 18% for the unaffected area on the left side). However, the exact percentage cannot be determined without a thorough examination of the patient, so choice (D) is the closest approximation."
