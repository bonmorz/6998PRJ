This is supported by the patient\u2019s symptoms, including restlessness, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension, which are consistent with cyanide toxicity. The fact that lactate levels continued to rise despite hemodialysis also suggests cyanide toxicity, as cyanide inhibits mitochondrial respiration, leading to increased lactate levels. Carbon monoxide poisoning and sulfmethemoglobinemia are less likely causes, as the patient did not have exposure to high levels of carbon monoxide or sulfur-containing drugs. Anemia is also unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms."
