Acarbose is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that blocks the breakdown of complex carbohydrates into glucose, therefore preventing an increase in blood glucose levels.

Glyburide and Exenatide are medications that stimulate insulin release and lower blood glucose levels, while Metformin decreases glucose production by the liver, so none of them would prevent the breakdown of sucrose into glucose."
