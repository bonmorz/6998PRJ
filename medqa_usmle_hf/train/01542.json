The described immunodeficiency is most likely severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) which is associated with absent T-cells. Accumulation of deoxyadenosine is a characteristic finding of adenosine deaminase deficiency, which is one of the causes of SCID. Dysfunctional cell chemotaxis is seen in chronic granulomatous disease, which is a disorder of phagocytes, not T-cells. Negative nitroblue-tetrazolium test is also seen in chronic granulomatous disease. Nonfunctional common gamma chain is seen in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency."

The fact that there are absent T-cells means that the disorder affects cellular immunity. Among the options, only accumulation of deoxyadenosine is associated with an autosomal recessive form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which is a group of disorders with absent T-cells. This accumulation is toxic to developing lymphocytes and suppresses lymphopoiesis. The other options are associated with different forms of immunodeficiency disorders. Dysfunctional cell chemotaxis is associated with chronic granulomatous disease, a primary immunodeficiency disorder that affects the phagocytic cells. Negative nitroblue-tetrazolium test is also associated with chronic granulomatous disease as it indicates the absence of the ability of phagocytic cells to produce superoxides to kill pathogens. Nonfunctional common gamma chain is associated with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, which also affects the cellular immunity by impairing the development of T and NK cells."
