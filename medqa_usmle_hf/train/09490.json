In option B, PTH is increased, calcium is decreased, phosphate is increased, and calcitriol is decreased, which would be expected in a patient with chronic kidney disease.

PTH is expected to be elevated and calcitriol is expected to be decreased. However, the elevated phosphate levels due to kidney disease can also contribute to the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism, leading to an increase in PTH. In addition, low calcium levels can stimulate the release of PTH. As a result, the expected findings in this patient would be PTH \u2191, Ca \u2193, phosphate \u2191, and calcitriol \u2193, as seen in option (B)."

The patient has chronic kidney disease and is on hemodialysis, which suggests potential mineral and bone disorder (MBD). The finding of peripheral pitting edema and low albumin levels also suggest hypoalbuminemia, which can contribute to MBD. PTH (parathyroid hormone) is expected to be elevated in this patient due to chronic kidney disease, and it can lead to bone resorption, calcium release, and phosphate retention, causing low serum calcium and high serum phosphate levels. Calcitriol (active vitamin D) deficiency, as well as impaired kidney function, can also contribute to calcium and phosphate abnormalities.

The patient has stage 4 chronic kidney disease and is on hemodialysis, which can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. This is indicated by the elevated PTH levels, which can result in decreased calcium levels. The elevated phosphate levels can be attributed to the impaired kidney function, as the kidneys are responsible for excreting excess phosphate. The decreased calcitriol levels can also be a result of the impaired kidney function, as the kidneys are responsible for converting vitamin D to its active form, calcitriol.

The presence of pitting edema suggests fluid overload. The complete blood count shows mild anemia and mild leukopenia with neutrophilia. These findings are consistent with renal disease. In patients with chronic kidney disease, there is a disturbance in calcium-phosphate metabolism, resulting in hyperparathyroidism. This leads to increased bone resorption, decreased serum calcium, and increased serum phosphate levels. The decreased calcitriol levels result in impaired intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Therefore, the expected findings in this patient are PTH\u2191, Ca\u2193, phosphate\u2191, and calcitriol\u2193, which is option B."

The patient has stage 4 chronic kidney disease, which means that his kidneys are not functioning properly and he is on hemodialysis. The peripheral pitting edema and scratch marks suggest fluid overload. The high potassium level and low bicarbonate level indicate that the kidneys are not effectively regulating electrolytes and acid-base balance. The anemia and low albumin level are also common in patients with chronic kidney disease. The expected findings in this patient's current visit are PTH (parathyroid hormone) increased, calcium decreased, phosphate increased, and calcitriol decreased. This is because chronic kidney disease can lead to renal osteodystrophy, which is characterized by abnormalities in bone metabolism, including high PTH levels, low vitamin D levels, and disturbances in the calcium and phosphate balance."

The patient's blood test results show an increase in potassium and a decrease in albumin, indicating potassium retention and malnutrition, respectively.
