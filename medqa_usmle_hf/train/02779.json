The nodular mass on the gastric stump is suspicious of cancer. Abdominopelvic CT scan is necessary to determine the extent of the disease and help plan further management. Stool antigen test for H. pylori is useful in diagnosing gastroduodenal ulcers but is not indicated in this case. Laparoscopy may be indicated for diagnosis and staging of gastric cancer, but CT scan is less invasive and provides more information. Vitamin B12 assessment is useful in detecting pernicious anemia but is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management."

Stool antigen test for H. pylori is not necessary in this case as the patient had a partial gastrectomy 20 years ago.

The patient has a history of gastrectomy, recurring black stools, and an upper endoscopy showing a nodular mass, which all suggest a possible gastric cancer. An abdominopelvic CT scan can help confirm the suspicion and determine the stage of the cancer. Stool antigen test for H. pylori is not indicated here as the patient's symptoms and history suggest a more serious condition.
