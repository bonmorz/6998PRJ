The patient\u2019s BMI suggests obesity, which increases the risk for loss of ciliary action and impaired tubal motility. History of pelvic tenderness and vaginal discharge suggest a possible pelvic inflammatory disease, which can also cause tubal damage and subsequent infertility. Insulin resistance can lead to hormonal imbalances but is less likely to be the sole cause of infertility in this case. Adverse effects of the oral contraceptive pill would not persist for over a year after discontinuation. Primary ovarian insufficiency is less likely given regular menstrual cycles."

The fact that the patient's husband's semen analysis was normal also suggests that male factor infertility is not the cause. The fact that the patient has been off oral contraceptive pills for a year suggests that any adverse effects from the pill have likely resolved by now."
