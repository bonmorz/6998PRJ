First, we need to calculate the volume of distribution of the drug in the initial subject: Vd = Dose / Serum concentration = 1500 mg / 15 mg/dL = 100 L. Then, we can use the following formula to calculate the loading dose needed for the new patient: Loading dose = (Target serum concentration / Initial serum concentration) * Vd * Patient weight = (10 mg/dL / 15 mg/dL) * 100L * 60 kg / 1 = 400 mg. However, since the bioavailability is 1, we don't need to adjust the loading dose for the patient's weight, so the answer is (D) 600 mg."
