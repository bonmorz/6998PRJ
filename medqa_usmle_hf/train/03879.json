The presence of a systolic murmur and an S3 gallop suggest possible heart failure. The barium radiograph shows a dilated esophagus and possible esophageal diverticulum. The most likely diagnosis is achalasia, which is characterized by the absence of myenteric plexus neurons. Atrophy of esophageal smooth muscle cells is seen in scleroderma, infiltration of eosinophils in the epithelium is seen in eosinophilic esophagitis, and presence of metaplastic columnar epithelium is seen in Barrett's esophagus. None of these diagnoses fit the patient's history and symptoms."
