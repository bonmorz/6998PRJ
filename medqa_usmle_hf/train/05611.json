The patient\u2019s symptoms and colonoscopy findings suggest that she has Crohn\u2019s disease, with focal areas of inflammation in the ileum. Crohn\u2019s disease can cause intestinal strictures and obstruction, which puts the patient at risk for intestinal obstruction. Metastasis to the liver is not associated with Crohn\u2019s disease. Carcinoid syndrome is associated with tumor-produced hormones and gastrointestinal symptoms but is not associated with Crohn\u2019s disease. Paralytic ileus is not associated with Crohn\u2019s disease, which causes inflammation and structural changes in the intestine rather than a functional ileus."
