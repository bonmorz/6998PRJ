The patient\u2019s symptoms have persisted despite treatment with diphenhydramine and there are no abnormalities found on physical examination and chest x-ray. Pulmonary function testing can help determine if the cough is caused by asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which are common in patients with obesity. Azithromycin is used to treat respiratory tract infections, but there are no indications of an infection in this case. Omeprazole therapy is used to treat acid reflux disease, which does not seem to be related to the patient\u2019s cough. A CT scan of the chest is not indicated at this point."

The patient has a nonproductive cough and no abnormalities on chest examination and X-ray, ruling out pneumonia as the cause of the cough. The patient\u2019s BMI indicates obesity, which puts him at risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and asthma. Pulmonary function testing can help diagnose the underlying cause of the cough and guide treatment. Azithromycin is generally reserved for treating bacterial infections, which do not appear to be present in this case. Omeprazole therapy is used for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is not a likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms in this case. CT scan of the chest may be considered if other diagnostic tools are inconclusive or if lung cancer or other serious lung conditions are suspected."

Therefore, pulmonary function testing would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate for underlying lung disease, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which can cause chronic cough. Azithromycin therapy is indicated for respiratory infections, which have been ruled out.
