The patient\u2019s loud snoring and large body habitus suggest obstructive sleep apnea as the cause of his excessive daytime sleepiness. Poor oropharyngeal tone contributes to the airway obstruction during sleep, leading to frequent arousals and daytime sleepiness. Insufficient sleep duration and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder are not consistent with the patient\u2019s complaint of good sleep quality and gradual worsening of symptoms. A psychiatric disorder is also unlikely to be the primary cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms."

Insufficient sleep duration and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are unlikely causes given that the patient sleeps approximately 8-9 hours per night.
