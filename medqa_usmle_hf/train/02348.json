The child\u2019s ability to speak at home and with friends, and the normal language development suggest that expressive speech delay is unlikely. Normal development would not explain the child\u2019s selective mutism in certain settings. Child abuse at school without any other symptoms is also unlikely. Selective mutism, the inability to speak in certain social settings, appears to fit the child\u2019s symptoms."

The child is showing signs of normal development in terms of his ability to speak and communicate at home, but is exhibiting selective mutism at school and in public situations. This is a rare condition where a child is able to speak in certain situations but not in others, often due to anxiety or social phobia. It is important to rule out other causes, such as child abuse, but based on the information provided, selective mutism is the most likely explanation."
