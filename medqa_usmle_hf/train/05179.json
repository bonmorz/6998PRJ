The symptoms of inconsolable crying for hours a day that resolve spontaneously suggest colic, which is a normal and self-limiting condition that often resolves by 3-4 months of age. Administering simethicone or pantoprazole is not supported by evidence for treating colic. Gripe water, which contains various herbs and sometimes alcohol, is not recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Reassurance and nonpharmacologic measures such as changes in feeding techniques, swaddling, and soothing may be helpful."

Gripe water is not recommended due to concerns about the ingredients and potential side effects. Reassurance is the most appropriate next step in management. It is important to educate parents about colic and provide advice on coping mechanisms, such as swaddling, rocking, and pacifiers."
