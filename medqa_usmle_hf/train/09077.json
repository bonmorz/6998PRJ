The patient's symptoms and laboratory and imaging findings are suggestive of lymphoma, and the histopathologic examination confirms the presence of CD20-positive lymphocytes with a high proliferative index. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and it presents with rapidly enlarging lymph nodes, systemic symptoms, and high proliferative rate. Marginal zone lymphoma typically presents with indolent, slowly growing lymphadenopathy, and Hairy cell leukemia typically presents with splenomegaly and pancytopenia. Follicular lymphoma also presents with slowly enlarging lymph nodes, but it is characterized by follicle-like structures and a low proliferative rate."
