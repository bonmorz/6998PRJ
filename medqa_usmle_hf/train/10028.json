Study A has a better control over confounding variables as patients were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups.

Study B only used dietary recall to estimate sodium intake which is less accurate than direct measurement, and also did not randomize participants, which increases the likelihood of selection bias. Both studies can use a chi-square test to analyze results since they are assessing the presence of a categorical outcome (atrial fibrillation) between two groups (treatment and control). Therefore, the correct answer is option (B) - Study A allows for better control of confounding variables."

Study A involved random assignment to treatment and control groups, allowing for better control over confounding variables. Study B relied on self-reported dietary recall, which is subject to measurement bias and may not accurately represent actual sodium intake, therefore, limiting its ability to control confounding variables. Both studies can use a chi-square test to analyze the results as the outcome is categorical (presence or absence of atrial fibrillation) and the exposure variable (salt restriction) is also categorical (treatment or control group in Study A, estimated sodium intake in Study B).
