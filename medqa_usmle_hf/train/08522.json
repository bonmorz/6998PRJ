IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies are commonly used to diagnose celiac disease. Periodic acid-Schiff-positive macrophages are seen in Whipple's disease, which can also cause malabsorption, but the patient's symptoms do not fit that diagnosis. Elevated serum amylase concentration suggests pancreatic disease, which is not likely in this case. Positive hydrogen breath test suggests bacterial overgrowth, which can cause similar symptoms, but celiac disease is a more likely explanation given the patient's history and presentation."
