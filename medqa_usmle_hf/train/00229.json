Thus, the appropriate statistical test to use is the chi-square test. This test is used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. The null hypothesis is that there is no association between the two variables, while the alternative hypothesis is that there is an association. In this case, the null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference in the frequency of interference with daily functioning between the two treatment groups. The p-value for the chi-square test can be calculated and compared to the significance level (usually 0.05) to determine if the results are statistically significant."
