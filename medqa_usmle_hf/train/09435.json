The patient's concern for her skin and spending several hours on make-up every day suggest that she may have body dysmorphic disorder. A diagnosis of major depressive disorder should also be considered, as constant concern about one's appearance can cause low self-esteem and depression. Malingering and Munchausen's syndrome are unlikely as the patient's concern appears genuine, and her BMI indicates she is not under-nourished."

The patient shows excessive concern about her physical appearance and spends several hours every morning using make-up, which suggests a possible underlying mental health disorder. Major depressive disorder can cause negative self-image and difficulty with decision-making, which can contribute to the patient's excessive concern about her appearance. Malingering and Munchausen's syndrome involves faking or exaggerating symptoms for secondary gain, which is not evident in this case. Anorexia can cause weight loss and malnutrition, which can affect the patient's appearance, but this is not suggested by the patient's BMI of 21."
