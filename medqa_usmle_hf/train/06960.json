The skin lesions suggest eczema, which is common in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) caused by defective beta-2 integrin. Defective IL-2R gamma chain causes X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), defective NADPH oxidase causes chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), and defective WAS gene causes Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is a defective beta-2 integrin."
