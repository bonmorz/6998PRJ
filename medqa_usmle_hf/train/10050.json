The patient\u2019s low potassium and growth retardation suggest a defect in the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter at the thick ascending loop of Henle, a condition called Bartter syndrome. This defect can cause polyuria, polydipsia, and nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting). The urine test results also show elevated urine calcium and osmolality, which are consistent with this diagnosis. The other options do not fit with the patient\u2019s history or laboratory results."

The patient\u2019s laboratory tests show low serum potassium and high serum bicarbonate, which suggests metabolic alkalosis. The urine test shows high urinary calcium, which points to hypercalciuria. These findings, along with the patient\u2019s symptoms of bedwetting, suggest a defect in the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter in the thick ascending loop of Henle. This can lead to excessive salt and water loss, leading to polydipsia, polyuria, and bedwetting. Option A is incorrect because defect in NaCl reabsorption at the distal collecting tube would cause hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, but the laboratory tests show normal chloride levels. Option C is incorrect because generalized reabsorptive defects in the proximal collecting tube would cause hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis, but the laboratory tests show high bicarbonate levels. Option D is incorrect because hereditary deficiency of 11B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase would cause hypertension and hypokalemia, which are not present in this patient."
