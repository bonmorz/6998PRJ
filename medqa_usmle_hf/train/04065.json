Option C is the correct answer because antibiotics that cause ototoxicity, such as aminoglycosides, bind the 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibit protein synthesis, ultimately leading to damage in the inner ear. Options A and B refer to antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis by binding the 50S ribosomal subunit, and option D refers to an antibiotic that inhibits translocation by binding the 30S ribosomal subunit, but none of these are associated with ototoxicity like option C."

Ampicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, and it is commonly used to treat meningitis in neonates. Antibiotic X is known to cause ototoxicity, which means it can damage the structures of the inner ear, causing hearing loss or balance problems. Among the options provided, only antibiotics that bind to ribosomes affect protein synthesis. Antibiotic X binds to the 30s ribosomal subunit and inhibits the formation of the initiation complex, which blocks the bacterial protein synthesis, and can ultimately lead to cell death and antibiotic action. The mechanism of action for antibiotic X is not reversible, and it can cause permanent damage to the auditory and vestibular systems."
