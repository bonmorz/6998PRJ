Countertransference occurs when a therapist has a personal emotional reaction to a patient that interferes with their ability to provide effective therapy. In this case, the therapist's own personal loss may be influencing her behavior towards the patient, which is not appropriate in the context of therapy. Isolation refers to a defense mechanism where a person compartmentalizes feelings or situations rather than dealing with them. Sublimation is a defense mechanism where a person redirects their unacceptable urges into more socially acceptable behaviors. Identification occurs when a person models their behavior after someone else in order to cope with their own feelings."
