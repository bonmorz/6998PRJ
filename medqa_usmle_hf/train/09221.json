A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis (usually the hypothesis that there is no difference between groups) is true, but is rejected in error, leading to a conclusion that there is a difference between groups when there really isn't. This is also known as a false positive. Option (A) is referring to a lack of statistical power, which is a different issue. Option (C) is referring to a type 2 error, which occurs when the null hypothesis is false, but is accepted in error, leading to a conclusion that there is no difference between groups when there really is. Option (D) is incorrect as well, as the confidence interval is not directly related to type 1 error."
