The patient\u2019s symptoms along with snoring and choking at night suggest sleep apnea, which can lead to chronic hypoxia and ultimately cause right ventricular heart failure with jugular venous distention and peripheral edema. The presence of right axis deviation on ECG also supports the diagnosis of right ventricular hypertrophy due to chronic hypoxia. Coronary artery disease may cause shortness of breath on exertion but does not explain the other symptoms.

Alveolar destruction is more likely to cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which presents with symptoms such as cough and wheezing rather than edema and jugular venous distention.
