A normal baseline ACTH level would suggest adrenal gland as the cause, and low baseline ACTH levels indicate exogenous steroid use. An elevation of cortisol above pre-test levels would suggest an adrenal tumor."

In this case, a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test can be used to differentiate between Cushing's disease (pituitary adenoma causing excess ACTH production) and adrenal Cushing's syndrome (adrenal tumor causing excess cortisol production). In Cushing's disease, there will be an abnormal Cortisol suppression response, but ACTH levels will be elevated. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."

The physical examination findings suggest Cushing's syndrome, which can be caused by a pituitary adenoma that secretes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used to distinguish between pituitary and ectopic causes. In pituitary adenoma, suppression of cortisol production is expected with high-dose dexamethasone, but the baseline ACTH level will be elevated. Therefore, answer (B), cortisol suppression and high baseline ACTH, is the correct answer."

The symptoms, including truncal obesity, distal muscle wasting, and moon facies, suggest Cushing's syndrome, which can be caused by a pituitary adenoma. High-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used to distinguish between different causes of Cushing's syndrome. In a pituitary adenoma, there is an increase in the production of ACTH, leading to high baseline ACTH levels. However, because cortisol is suppressed by the high-dose dexamethasone, the cortisol suppression test should be positive. Therefore, answer (B) is the correct choice, with cortisol suppression and high baseline ACTH."
