Endometrial tissue in fallopian tubes can cause tubal infertility or ectopic pregnancy but not the symptoms described. Cystic enlargement of ovaries is more likely to present with symptoms such as abdominal pain and abnormal menstrual bleeding. Benign smooth muscle tumors of the uterus, or fibroids, can cause heavy bleeding and pelvic pain, but the characteristic finding on ultrasonography is a well-defined border."
