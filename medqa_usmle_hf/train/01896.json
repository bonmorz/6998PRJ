The fact that the behavior is specific to certain classes suggests reduced interest, rather than a mood disorder.

Based on the symptoms presented by the patient, it is likely that the issue is not related to intellectual disability or mood disorder. ADHD, however, is a possibility, but the fact that the patient is able to focus on things he enjoys indicates that the issue is more likely to be reduced interest in subjects he finds less engaging. This can lead to difficulty in maintaining focus and motivation in those subjects, resulting in poorer grades."

The IQ of 102 is in normal range, making intellectual disability less likely. There is no evidence of mood disorder. The most likely explanation for this patient\u2019s grades is reduced interest in certain subjects, possibly due to a lack of engagement or motivation, which can be addressed with behavioral and cognitive strategies."
