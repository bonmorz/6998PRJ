The symptoms and findings suggest a myocardial infarction, which can lead to a decrease in cardiac output due to damage to the heart. In response, the body can increase systemic vascular resistance to maintain blood pressure. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because there can be an increase in systemic vascular resistance in response to a myocardial infarction. Option (B) is incorrect because there may be a decrease in venous return due to damage to the heart. Option (D) is incorrect because there is usually a decrease in cardiac output, not an increase, due to damage to the heart."
