Atenolol is a beta-blocker that specifically targets beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, resulting in decreased heart rate and contractility. It primarily affects the atrioventricular node activity, as it slows down the conduction velocity of electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles, thus reducing heart rate."

The patient has symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which is supported by the laboratory results showing a low TSH and high T4. Methimazole is used to treat hyperthyroidism, and atenolol is a beta blocker used to treat the symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as tachycardia and tremor. Beta blockers act by decreasing sympathetic activity, primarily by reducing the activity of the heart's SA and AV nodes. Therefore, the most likely answer is (A) atrioventricular node activity."
