Drug B reduces the potency of drug A when combined in the same solution, which suggests it is a competitive antagonist. Adding more drug A increases the maximal efficacy (Emax) of drug A, which means it is not a non-competitive antagonist. Drug C works on the same molecules as drugs A and B, reduces the maximal efficacy (Emax) of drug A significantly when combined with drug A, and is not reversible. This suggests drug C is a non-competitive antagonist."

Based on the information provided, drug B is a partial agonist, since it reduces the potency of drug A but can still elicit a response. Adding more of drug A increases the Emax because it can fully occupy the target site. Drug C, on the other hand, reduces the Emax of drug A when combined, indicating that it is a non-competitive antagonist. This means that it binds to a different site on the molecule than drug A, causing a conformational change that prevents drug A from binding and eliciting a response."

From the information given, we know that drug B is a non-competitive antagonist of drug A, which means it decreases the potency and maximal efficacy of drug A. When additional drug A is added, the Emax of drug A increases, which suggests that drug A is a partial agonist. Drug C reduces the Emax of drug A significantly when combined, which indicates that drug C is a non-competitive antagonist, similar to drug B. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) non-competitive antagonist."

The fact that additional drug A can increase Emax suggests that drug A is not at maximum capacity and can overcome the antagonistic effect of drug B. Therefore, drug C must be a non-competitive antagonist as it reduces the Emax of drug A significantly. Competitive antagonists bind at the same site as drug A and can be overcome by increasing the concentration of drug A. Inverse agonists induce the opposite effect of an agonist and are not relevant to the scenario. Reversible antagonists can be competitive or non-competitive and do not provide enough information to differentiate drug C."

A competitive antagonist would compete with drug A for binding sites, but would not affect its maximal efficacy.

The term reversible antagonist simply indicates that the antagonist can be displaced by increasing the concentration of agonist."
