It involves taking in the values and ideals of others as if they were your own, which could explain why the patient is trying to imitate his coworker who got the promotion. Sublimation refers to channeling one's impulses into more socially acceptable behavior, conversion is when psychological stress converts into physical symptoms, and regression is when one reverts back to an earlier stage of development."
