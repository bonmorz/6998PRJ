The lack of Sialyl-Lewis X on the neutrophils indicates a deficiency in the rolling process, which is the first step of leukocyte recruitment to sites of infection. Rolling enables the neutrophils to interact with endothelial cells in order to undergo firm adhesion and eventually transmigrate through the vessel walls. Deficiency in chemoattraction, tight adhesion, or diapedesis would not result in the specific symptoms described in this case."
