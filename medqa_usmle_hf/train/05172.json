To calculate relative risk in a cohort study, we need to divide the probability of the outcome in the exposed group by the probability of the outcome in the unexposed group. In this case, the probability of AML among exposed is 17/19 and the probability of AML among unexposed is 67/181. Therefore, the relative risk is 0.90 (17/19 divided by 67/181)."

Dividing these gives a relative risk of 6.48, indicating that individuals exposed to the pesticide chemical are 6.48 times more likely to develop AML compared to those who were not exposed. Option A is incorrect because it uses prevalence instead of probability. Option B is incorrect because it uses odds instead of probability. Option D is incorrect because it does not take into account the exposure to the pesticide chemical."

The formula for relative risk is (a/(a+b))/(c/(c+d)), where a is the number of cases with exposure, b is the number of cases without exposure, c is the number of controls with exposure, and d is the number of controls without exposure. Applying the numbers from the scenario, we get (17/(17+67))/(2/(2+114)) = (17/84)/(2/116) = 5.94. Therefore, the relative risk of developing AML upon exposure to the pesticide is 5.94 in this study group. Option (A) calculates the odds ratio, option (B) calculates the odds ratio in a different way, and option (D) calculates the proportion of cases in the study group."

So, the relative risk is 17/19 divided by 67/181, which simplifies to 8.95. Therefore, (C) is the correct answer.
