Dyspnea and palpitations suggest a cardiovascular condition, and the ECG shows a type II second-degree atrioventricular block, which can cause bradycardia and arrhythmias. The diagnosis is Lyme carditis, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, transmitted by black-legged ticks. Ceftriaxone is the treatment of choice for Lyme carditis. Oral amoxicillin and doxycycline can be used for early Lyme disease but not for Lyme carditis. Permanent pacemaker implantation is not necessary for a type II second-degree AV block caused by Lyme carditis, as it usually resolves with treatment."
