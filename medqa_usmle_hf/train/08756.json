PCV13 is a conjugate vaccine, which uses a carrier molecule to enhance the immune response against the pneumococcal polysaccharide antigens. It is contraindicated in patients with a previous anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine component or to a previous dose of PCV13. Therefore, PPSV23 is a better option for the patient. The other options provided in the answer choices are incorrect as they do not apply to this scenario."
