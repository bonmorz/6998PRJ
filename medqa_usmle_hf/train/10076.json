Echocardiography may be done later to assess cardiac function. Observation alone is not appropriate for a suspected ACS. Metoprolol can be given after the patient\u2019s blood pressure has stabilized and imaging has been performed to assess for any contraindications."

Metoprolol may be used for beta-blockade, but reperfusion therapy is the priority at this time. Observation alone is not sufficient management for an acute coronary syndrome."
