The symptoms and physical findings are consistent with infectious mononucleosis, including the palpable spleen and hepatomegaly, and the blood smear morphology of atypical lymphocytes. Cytomegalovirus infection can have similar symptoms but typically doesn't cause hepatosplenomegaly. Graves' disease is unlikely in a 7-year-old and viral hepatitis doesn't have the same blood smear morphology."
