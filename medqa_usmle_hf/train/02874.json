The relevant option is fractional excretion of sodium, which is low in pre-renal failure. A high urine/plasma creatinine ratio suggests intrinsic renal failure, whereas a low urine Na concentration suggests extra-renal loss of fluid, dehydration or some medications. Urine osmolarity can be consistent with both pre-renal and intrinsic renal failure."

Pre-renal failure is characterized by decreased renal blood flow, which leads to decreased urine output and increased concentration of urine. Among the options, fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is the most reliable criteria to differentiate pre-renal from renal causes of acute kidney injury. A FENa of less than 1% suggests pre-renal failure. A urine osmolarity of 280 mOsm/kg and urine/plasma creatinine ratio of 10 are not specific enough to differentiate between pre-renal and renal failure. A urine Na of 80 mEq/L is above the normal range but not enough to suggest a diagnosis of pre-renal failure."

Pre-renal failure is caused by decreased blood flow to the kidneys, leading to decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and resulting in decreased urine output.
