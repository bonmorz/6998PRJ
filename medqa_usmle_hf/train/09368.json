A full thickness biopsy or partial gastrectomy may be necessary depending on the diagnosis after further testing, but management of bleeding and potential infection should take priority first.

MALToma is a low-grade lymphoma that is often associated with chronic inflammation caused by Helicobacter pylori infection.
