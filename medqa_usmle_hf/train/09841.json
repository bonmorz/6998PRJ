The symptoms suggest maternal estrogen withdrawal, which occurs when high levels of estrogen from the mother cross the placenta and they are suddenly removed when the baby is born. This can lead to vaginal bleeding, breast enlargement, and neonatal acne. Other options, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia and genitourinary infection, would present with different symptoms. External trauma is unlikely as there is no history of trauma."
