The patient is experiencing a compartment syndrome, indicated by the cold and edematous toes, absence of distal pulses, and a delta pressure of 25 mmHg. Escharotomy is the best next step in management to relieve pressure and prevent tissue necrosis. Amputation is not necessary at this point and fasciotomy is a more invasive procedure than escharotomy. Transfer to a burn center can be considered but managing the compartment syndrome should be the priority."
