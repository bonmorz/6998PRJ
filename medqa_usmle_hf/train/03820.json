The symptoms and the family history suggest that the child may have albinism, a genetic disorder that affects melanin production. This is caused by a defect in the enzyme involved in the metabolism of DOPA. Phenylalanine is involved in the metabolism of tyrosine, while leucine is an essential amino acid. Homogentisic acid is involved in the metabolism of tyrosine and phenylalanine, but it is associated with a different genetic disorder known as alkaptonuria."

The symptoms described in the question suggest that the child has albinism, which is caused by a defect in melanin synthesis. Melanin is synthesized from tyrosine through a series of enzymatic steps, which includes the conversion of DOPA to melanin. Therefore, a defect in DOPA metabolism would result in a lack of melanin production, which would explain the child's pale skin and white hair. Phenylalanine metabolism is involved in phenylketonuria, leucine metabolism is involved in maple syrup urine disease, and homogentisic acid metabolism is involved in alkaptonuria, none of which are consistent with the symptoms described."
