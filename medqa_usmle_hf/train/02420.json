The patient presents with hypertension, nodulocystic acne, and signs of androgen excess (gynecomastia and testicular shrinkage), which suggest a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome or congenital adrenal hyperplasia. However, the patient is male, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia is rare in males. Thus, the most likely diagnosis is an androgen-producing adrenal tumor, which puts him at risk for developing hepatic adenoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma is not associated with androgen excess, and renal cyst or Type 1 diabetes are not associated with this presentation."
