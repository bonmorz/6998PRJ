Therefore, the next best step in management is to temporarily stop antihypertensive medications and monitor blood pressure regularly while the patient is in the hospital. Option A (EEG) and option B (Holter monitoring) are not indicated based on the presented information, as there is no indication of seizures or cardiac arrhythmias. Option D (tilt table testing) may be considered in the outpatient setting to confirm the diagnosis, but is not the immediate next step in management."
