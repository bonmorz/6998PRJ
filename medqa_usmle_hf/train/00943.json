The symptoms and blood work point towards a diagnosis of methylmalonic acidemia, which occurs due to the inability to metabolize methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. This is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which converts methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA.

The carbon-14 propionate incorporation assay measures the activity of the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which is responsible for converting methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. Since little to none of the radiolabeled carbons of the propionate appeared in any of the intermediates of the Krebs cycle, it suggests that this reaction, methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, is not taking place in this individual. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Methylmalonyl-CoA --> Succinyl-CoA. The other reactions listed are not directly related to the metabolism of methylmalonic acid."
