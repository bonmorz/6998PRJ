Elevated liver enzymes, including AST, ALT, and GGT, are common in liver damage. Option B shows only slightly elevated AST and moderately elevated ALT, suggesting mild to moderate liver damage. Option A and D show very high AST and ALT levels, suggesting severe liver damage, while option C shows very high AST and moderately elevated ALT, which is less likely. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."

Based on this, the most likely laboratory values would be AST: 255, ALT: 130, GGT: 114, which is option (B)."

In liver disease, AST and ALT levels are typically elevated, with ALT being the more specific marker for liver damage.
