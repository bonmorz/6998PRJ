The mild left-hand tremor, increased muscle tone, narrow gait, and difficulty turning further support this diagnosis. Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia typically present with memory impairment and cognitive decline, but not necessarily with behavioral changes and motor symptoms. Serotonin syndrome is not likely given the patient's medication history and symptoms."

The presence of a left-hand tremor and slightly increased muscle tone also supports this diagnosis. Alzheimer\u2019s disease typically presents with memory loss as the first symptom, while frontotemporal dementia typically has behavioral changes as the first symptom.

Alzheimer\u2019s disease is characterized by memory loss but not usually behavioral changes and hallucinations. Frontotemporal dementia presents with significant behavioral and language changes. Serotonin syndrome occurs when there is an excess of serotonin and is unlikely in this patient due to her current medication regimen, which includes escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor."
