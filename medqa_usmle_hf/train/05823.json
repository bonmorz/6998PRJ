Pressure sensation is transmitted by mechanoreceptors called Merkel cells and Pacinian corpuscles, which are more resistant to local anesthetics than the nerve fibers that carry temperature and touch sensation. Therefore, the nerve function that would be the last to be blocked by the lidocaine would be pressure sensation."
