The patient is presenting with symptoms of thrombocytopenia, recurrent infections, and skin lesions, suggesting a diagnosis of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. CD43 is a protein found on the surface of platelets that regulates their activation and adhesion, and decreased expression of CD43 is a common finding in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, so option A is the correct answer. The other options are not relevant to the diagnosis of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome."
