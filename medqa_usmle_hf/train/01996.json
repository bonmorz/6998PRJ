This suggests a flare-up of the condition, and the patient is also hypotensive which can be a sign of sepsis. Abdominal x-ray can help rule out toxic megacolon, which is a complication of ulcerative colitis. IV antibiotics like metronidazole and rectal vancomycin may also be initiated, but the first priority is fluid resuscitation and ruling out complications. Double-contrast barium enema and colonoscopy are contraindicated in acute colitis flares."

The patient\u2019s symptoms are suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease, specifically exacerbation of ulcerative colitis.

An abdominal x-ray can help assess for toxic megacolon, which is a surgical emergency. Antibiotics and colonoscopy are not the appropriate next steps in management. Double-contrast barium enema may also be contraindicated in this setting as it carries a risk of perforation in patients with acute colitis."
