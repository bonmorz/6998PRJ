The patient presents with poor weight gain, easy fatigability, and shortness of breath, which may be due to a cardiac defect. The holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border suggests a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is the most common congenital heart defect. Atrial septal defect (ASD) will present with a widely split fixed S2 and a systolic ejection murmur. Coarctation of the aorta will present with abdominal and/or lower extremity claudication, hypertension, and weak pulses in the lower extremities. Tetralogy of Fallot presents with a systolic ejection murmur and a single S2."
