The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), given the snoring at night, the excessive daytime sleepiness, and the low-lying palate. The most appropriate next step in management is in-laboratory polysomnography, which is the gold standard for diagnosis of sleep disorders such as OSA. ENT evaluation may be useful if there is suspicion of upper airway obstruction, but the low-lying palate does not confirm that suspicion. Overnight pulse oximetry is less sensitive and specific than polysomnography. Echocardiography is not likely to be helpful in this case as it does not address the patient\u2019s main complaint of fatigue."
