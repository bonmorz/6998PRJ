The patient presents with severe vertigo, vomiting, and difficulty walking, which suggests a condition affecting the vestibular system.

High-dose corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for an acute episode of MS. Acyclovir would be used for viral infections such as herpes simplex, which is not the suspected cause of this patient's symptoms. High doses of glucose are not indicated, and plasma exchange is not typically used as a first-line treatment for MS."

The symptoms suggest central vertigo which is often associated with vestibular neuritis or vestibular migraine, but the patient\u2019s history of acute vision loss and left-sided numbness suggest a possible history of multiple sclerosis. High-dose corticosteroids can help reduce the inflammation associated with multiple sclerosis attacks. Treatment with acyclovir is not indicated since there is no evidence to suggest that a viral infection is the cause. High doses of glucose also do not have any evidence-based support. Plasma exchange is used for severe refractory cases of multiple sclerosis and not for initial treatment."
