Nitrofurantoin, a possible cause of rhabdomyolysis, was given for the previous urinary tract infection. Rhabdomyolysis can cause acute kidney injury due to the release of myoglobin from muscle tissue, which can clog renal tubules. Thus, option (A) is the correct answer. The other options are less likely complications of rhabdomyolysis, with compartment syndrome being a possible complication if there is severe muscle swelling, metabolic alkalosis being unlikely due to the presence of blood and protein in the urine indicating a potential metabolic acidosis, and myocarditis being less likely in the absence of cardiovascular symptoms or abnormal cardiac enzymes."
