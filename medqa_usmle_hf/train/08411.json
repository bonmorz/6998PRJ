Applying very low continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) helps air pressure in the alveoli and pulmonary arterioles to increase, which makes the blood flow in Zone 1 decrease. Therefore, the correct answer is reduced blood flow in zone 1."

When the volunteer is given very low continuous positive airway pressure, blood flow to zone 1 will be reduced due to the increase in alveolar pressure. This is due to the fact that zone 1 is the area closest to the apex of the lung, and has lower vascular pressures than the rest of the lung. The reduced blood flow in zone 1 is due to the redistribution of blood flow from zone 1 to zones 2 and 3, which have higher vascular pressures."

The application of continuous positive airway pressure affects blood flow and pressure in the lung zones.

The application of continuous positive airway pressure decreases the pressure gradient for blood flow, leading to reduced blood flow in zone 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (A)."
