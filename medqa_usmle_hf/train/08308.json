Alzheimer disease usually has a gradual onset, ischemic stroke presents with focal deficits, and vitamin B12 deficiency usually causes peripheral neuropathy before affecting the cognitive function. The patient\u2019s alcohol and tobacco use may have contributed to the development of the subdural hematoma. Immediate imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and surgical intervention may be required."

Vitamin B12 deficiency may cause forgetfulness, but it would not explain the other symptoms."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including confusion, forgetfulness, balance issues, headache, and nausea with emesis, are consistent with subdural hematoma. This is further supported by the patient\u2019s history of falls and anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. Alzheimer disease is a possibility but is less likely given the acute onset of symptoms. An ischemic stroke would typically result in focal neurological deficits, which the patient does not exhibit. Vitamin B12 deficiency is a possibility but not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient\u2019s presentation."
