CD18 is present on leukocytes and is important for their adhesion to the vascular endothelium during inflammation, so deficiency in CD18 might impair the child's immune response to the infection. CD21 is a receptor for Epstein-Barr virus, CD1a is expressed on Langerhans cells and thymocytes, and CD3 is expressed on T cells, and none of them are directly related to the symptoms presented."
