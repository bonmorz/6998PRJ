This leaves $500 in remaining charges. She has a $300 copay, which leaves $200 in remaining charges. The plan also has a 20% coinsurance, which is calculated as 20% of the remaining $200, or $40. Therefore, the total amount she must pay out of pocket is $300 + $40 = $340. However, she has already paid $350 and $450 for her previous emergency department visits, which exceed the amount she owes for this visit. Therefore, the answer is (D) $1700, which is the total cost of her visit minus what she has already paid for her deductible, copay, and coinsurance."

Therefore, she must pay $300 + 0.2 x $2200 = $1700 out of pocket for her visit to the emergency department. Answer choice (D) is correct."

Since the patient has already met the deductible through her previous emergency department visits, she only needs to pay the copay and coinsurance for this visit, which totals $500. Therefore, the patient will need to pay $1700 out of pocket (total cost - insurance payment of $800 = $1900 x 20% = $380 + $300 copay = $680, then add the $1000 deductible that was already met)."

The patient has already met her annual deductible of $2000 and her insurance plan has a $300 copay for emergency medical visits. Therefore, her out-of-pocket cost for this emergency visit will be $300. After the copay, 20% coinsurance applies to the remaining cost of the visit, which is $2200 ($2500 total cost minus $300 copay). The patient will have to pay an additional $440 (20% of $2200). Therefore, the total out-of-pocket cost for the visit is $300 + $440 = $740. Since this is not one of the answer choices, we need to add the cost of her previous visits to the total. The total cost of all three visits is $2500 + $350 + $450 = $3300. Therefore, the patient must pay $3300 - $2000 (annual deductible) = $1300 before the coinsurance kicks in. Adding the $740 for this visit to the $1300 already paid, the total out-of-pocket cost is $2040. This is closest to answer choice (D) $1700, which is the correct answer."

The deductible has already been met from the previous two emergency visits, so the patient must pay the $300 copay plus 20% coinsurance. The copay is straightforward, but to calculate the coinsurance, we first subtract the deductible from the total cost: $2500 - $2000 = $500. Then, we calculate 20% of $500, which is $100. Therefore, the patient must pay $300 + $100 = $400 for coinsurance, plus the $300 copay, for a total out-of-pocket cost of $700. However, the question asks for the cost after deductible and copay are already paid, so the answer is $700 - $300 = $400, which is option (D)."

Adding this to the amount already paid for copay ($300), the patient must pay a total of $800 out of pocket. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."

The patient has already met her annual deductible of $2000, which means she is responsible for paying only the copay and coinsurance. The copay for emergency medical visits is $300, which means she must pay that first. The total cost of the visit is $2500, so the remaining $2200 (after the $300 copay) is subject to the 20% coinsurance. Therefore, she must pay 20% of $2200, which is $440. Adding the copay and coinsurance amounts together, her out-of-pocket cost is $300 + $440 = $740. However, since she had previous medical costs, her out-of-pocket maximum also comes into play. Her out-of-pocket maximum is the sum of her deductible, copays, and coinsurance, which is $2000 + $300 + $440 = $2740. Since her total cost is less than her out-of-pocket maximum, she only pays the actual cost of $2500, which is answer choice (D)."
