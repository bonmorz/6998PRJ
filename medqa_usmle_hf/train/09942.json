The patient is presenting with symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is characterized by chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. The extensive mucosal erythema, induration, and pseudopolyps seen during colonoscopy are consistent with IBD. Sulfasalazine and azathioprine are medications used to treat IBD, but they are not considered definitive treatments. Systemic corticosteroids can provide temporary relief of symptoms, but they are not a definitive treatment and can have significant side effects with prolonged use. Total proctocolectomy is the definitive treatment for severe, refractory IBD cases that do not respond to medical treatment. It involves the surgical removal of the colon and rectum and can result in a cure. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Total proctocolectomy."
