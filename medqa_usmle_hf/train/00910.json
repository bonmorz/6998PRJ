This may be due to a deficiency of erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates the production of red blood cells. The estimated GFR is also low, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. Erythropoietin therapy can help improve her anemia and overall energy levels. Oral iron supplements may not be effective if the cause of the anemia is not due to iron deficiency. Fluoxetine is used to treat depression and may not address her physical symptoms. Transfusion may not be a sustainable long-term solution for her anemia."

The low hemoglobin and erythrocyte count, along with the low MCH and MCV, suggest microcytic hypochromic anemia. The normal reticulocyte count suggests a decreased production of red blood cells, possibly due to iron deficiency or chronic kidney disease, which is also suggested by the decreased GFR and elevated serum creatinine. Oral iron supplements may not be effective if the anemia is due to chronic kidney disease, so erythropoietin is a better option. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant and may not address the underlying cause of the anemia. Transfusing red blood cells may be necessary in severe cases, but should not be the first option."
