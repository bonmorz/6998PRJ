The question asks which enzyme causes a chromatin modification that loosens DNA coiling, allowing for greater transcription of proteins. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are enzymes that acetylate histones, leading to a more open chromatin structure and enhanced transcription. Therefore, the correct answer is (B). DNA methyltransferases add methyl groups to DNA, histone deacetylases remove acetyl groups from histones, and Xist is a non-coding RNA molecule involved in X-chromosome inactivation."

The question is asking about a chromatin modification that increases transcription of proteins in a region of DNA, which suggests histone acetylation. Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) adds an acetyl group to histones, loosening the DNA and allowing for increased transcription. DNA methyltransferase adds a methyl group and does not necessarily affect DNA coiling. Histone deacetylase removes acetyl groups and would lead to tighter DNA coiling and reduced transcription.

Among the options, Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) is responsible for adding acetyl groups to histone proteins, which causes DNA to unwind and be more accessible for transcription. DNA methyltransferase adds methyl groups to DNA and can suppress gene expression. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) removes acetyl groups from histone proteins and can silence gene expression.

The question refers to a process by which chromatin modification causes increased transcription of proteins after DNA damage.
