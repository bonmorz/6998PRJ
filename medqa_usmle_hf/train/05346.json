The fundoscopic examination shows optic disc swelling and blurred margins, suggesting papilledema, which can occur due to increased intracranial pressure caused by uncontrolled hypertension or another underlying condition such as a brain tumor or intracranial hemorrhage. Retinal hemorrhage would present as flame-shaped hemorrhages or dot blot hemorrhages scattered in the retina. Optic nerve inflammation would present with optic disc hyperemia and edema. Neovascularization would present with the development of new, abnormal blood vessels in the retina."
