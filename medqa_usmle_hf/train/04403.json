Embolic occlusion of the pulmonary artery would cause sudden onset symptoms but the decreased tactile fremitus and diminished breath sounds over the left lung point in a different direction. Infection with gram-positive diplococci would require more symptoms such as fever and cough, and inflammation of costal cartilage would cause localized symptoms and tenderness."

Embolic occlusion of the pulmonary artery would present with sudden onset of dyspnea and chest pain but in a more acute and severe form. Infection with gram-positive diplococci is indicative of Streptococcus pneumonia, also known as pneumococcal pneumonia, but the symptoms do not match. Inflammation of the costal cartilage is indicative of costochondritis, but the decreased tactile fremitus and diminished breath sounds suggest lung involvement."
