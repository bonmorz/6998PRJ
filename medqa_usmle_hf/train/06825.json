Eosinophils in the urine are commonly observed in drug-induced interstitial nephritis.

Urinary crystals may be observed in some types of kidney stones, but this is not the most likely explanation for the patient\u2019s symptoms. Crescent-shape extracapillary cell proliferation is a histopathologic finding characteristic of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, which is not suggested by the patient\u2019s presentation."
