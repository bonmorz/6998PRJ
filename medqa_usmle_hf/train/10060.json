Diagnostic peritoneal lavage and FAST exam are less invasive methods to assess abdominal injuries and may be used in stable patients, but in this case, the patient\u2019s instability warrants a more urgent and thorough exploration. Laparoscopy may not be appropriate in this case as it may require additional time and may not provide adequate visualization and access for repair of the injuries."
