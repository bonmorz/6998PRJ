The crescendo-decrescendo murmur that increases in intensity on standing and decreases with fist clenching is consistent with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). HOCM is often caused by mutations in genes that encode for proteins of the sarcomere of the cardiac muscle fibers, including myosin heavy chain. Therefore, the most likely cause of her condition is a myosin heavy chain defect. Dystrophin defect is seen in muscular dystrophy, fibrillin-1 defect is seen in Marfan syndrome, and GAA trinucleotide repeats are seen in Friedreich ataxia."
