The most common medications used for ADHD are stimulants, which increase synaptic reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine. Option A is incorrect as GABAa channels are not believed to be directly involved in ADHD pathophysiology. Option B is incorrect as NMDA receptor antagonists are not used for ADHD. Option D is incorrect as blockade of D2 receptors is not the primary mechanism of action for ADHD medications."

The symptoms are consistent with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), for which the first-line pharmacotherapy is usually stimulant medications such as methylphenidate or amphetamines. These medications increase the synaptic concentrations of norepinephrine and dopamine by blocking their reuptake, leading to increased activity in regions of the brain related to attention and focus. Option (C) correctly describes this mechanism of action. Options (A) and (B) are not typically used to treat ADHD, and option (D) involves blocking dopamine receptors, which would worsen symptoms instead of improving them."

The symptoms suggest attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is often treated with stimulant medications such as methylphenidate and amphetamines. These medications work by increasing the synaptic concentration of norepinephrine and dopamine, which improves attention and motivation. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Option A describes benzodiazepines which act on GABAa receptors and are not used to treat ADHD. Option B describes ketamine which is an NMDA receptor antagonist that has been studied for depression treatment, but is not used to treat ADHD. Option D describes antipsychotic medications that block dopamine receptors and are not typically used to treat ADHD."
