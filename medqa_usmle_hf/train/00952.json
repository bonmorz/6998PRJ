Tenofovir is a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, which means it inhibits the virus enzyme that converts RNA to DNA. It will increase the Michaelis constant (Km) but not affect the maximum reaction rate (Vm), as it competes with the viral nucleotides and increases the amount of substrate needed to reach the same reaction rate. Therefore, the correct answer is (C)."

Tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor and its mechanism of action is to inhibit viral replication by blocking reverse transcriptase, an enzyme used by retroviruses such as HIV to convert RNA to DNA.

It does not directly affect the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of viral reverse transcriptase, but it does increase the Michaelis constant (Km), which reflects the enzyme's affinity for its substrate. This causes the enzyme to require a higher concentration of substrate to attain half of Vmax, effectively slowing down the reaction.

Tenofovir inhibits viral reverse transcriptase by competing with deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate (dATP) for incorporation into the viral DNA strand. This competition leads to an increase in Km, which is the substrate concentration required for half-maximum reaction velocity, but does not affect Vm, which is the maximum reaction rate. Therefore, the correct answer is (C), Vm will stay the same, and Km will increase."
