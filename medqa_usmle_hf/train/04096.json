Bipolar I disorder is characterized by at least one manic episode, which is not present in this case. Major depressive disorder alone does not explain the hypomanic symptoms. Substance abuse may cause similar symptoms, but the patient's history suggests no current use of cocaine or other substances."

The symptoms suggest that the patient is experiencing a manic episode with decreased need for sleep, increased energy, distractibility, and impulsive behavior regarding spending money. The previous episodes of fatigue and depression suggest a history of depressive episodes which, along with the current manic symptoms, support a diagnosis of Bipolar II disorder. The absence of psychotic symptoms differentiates Bipolar II from Bipolar I disorder. Substance abuse is not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's history."
