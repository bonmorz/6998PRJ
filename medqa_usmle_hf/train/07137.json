The enlarged, soft, and tender uterus, along with normal-appearing endometrial glands within the myometrium, are strong indicators of adenomyosis. Endometriosis usually causes infertility, while leiomyoma can cause heavy bleeding but does not involve the glands within the myometrium.

Adenomyosis is characterized by growth of endometrial tissue into the myometrium, which can lead to symptoms such as dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and pelvic pain, and an enlarged, soft, and tender uterus. Uterine biopsy showing normal-appearing endometrial glands within the myometrium is also consistent with adenomyosis. Endometriosis typically presents with cyclic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and infertility, and is not typically associated with an enlarged uterus. Leiomyoma is a common benign tumor of the uterine smooth muscle that can cause heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain, but it typically presents as a well-circumscribed, firm mass within the uterus. Endometrial carcinoma typically presents with postmenopausal bleeding, and uterine biopsy would show malignant endometrial cells."
