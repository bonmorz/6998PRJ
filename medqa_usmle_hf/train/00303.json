The symptoms, such as loss of sensation in the lateral part of the leg and dorsum of the foot and weakness in foot eversion, suggest that the superficial peroneal nerve is most likely injured. The nerve innervates the peroneus longus and brevis muscles, which evert the foot and stabilize the ankle. The sural nerve supplies sensation to the lateral foot and ankle, but it does not control any muscles. The deep peroneal nerve controls dorsiflexion of the foot and is not likely to be injured in this case. The saphenous nerve supplies sensation to the medial foot and ankle and does not control any muscles in the foot."

The symptoms, including loss of sensation in the lower part of the lateral side of the right leg and the dorsum of the right foot, and weakness in foot eversion, suggest an injury to the superficial peroneal nerve, which is responsible for foot eversion and sensation of the dorsum of the foot. Rattlesnake bites can cause tissue damage and can lead to compartment syndrome, which can damage nerves and blood vessels in the affected area. Fasciotomy is a procedure to relieve compartment syndrome by making incisions in the muscle fascia to release pressure. However, it can also cause nerve damage."

The sural nerve supplies the lateral border of the foot and the saphenous nerve supplies the medial side of the leg and foot, but neither of these nerves are likely to be injured in this scenario. The fact that the patient underwent fasciotomy suggests that there was significant pressure in the lower leg, which could have caused nerve injury."
