His wife is assumed to be unaffected, so she would be heterozygous. This means that each child they have would have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene from the father and a 50% chance of inheriting the normal gene from the mother. The chance of inheriting the mutated gene from both parents (and thus being affected by the disorder) is 50% multiplied by 50%, which equals 25%. However, since the wife comes from a population where 1 in 10,000 people are affected, the chance of her being a carrier for the disorder is 2 in 100 (or 1 in 50). This means that there is a 50% chance that any child they have would inherit the mutated gene from the father and a 1 in 50 chance that the mother is also a carrier, resulting in a 1% chance that the child would be affected by the disorder. Therefore, the answer is (C) 1%."

If his wife is a carrier for the same disorder, there is a 25% chance that their child would be affected. Since the population prevalence is 1 in 10,000, the carrier frequency is about 1 in 100. Therefore, the probability that his wife is a carrier is approximately 0.01 or 1%. The probability that their child would be affected is then 0.25 (25% chance of being affected as described above) multiplied by 0.01 (carrier frequency), which equals 0.0025 or 0.25%.

The probability of inheriting two mutant alleles (having the disorder) is therefore 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%. However, the question asks for the likelihood that a child would be affected, which includes both homozygous and heterozygous carriers. The probability of inheriting one mutant allele is 0.5, which means the probability of being a carrier is 0.5 + 0.5(0.0001) = 0.50005. Therefore, the probability of being affected (either homozygous or heterozygous) is 0.50005 * 0.25 = 0.125 or 12.5%, which is equal to 1% (option C)."
