The presentation of acute intermittent umbilical abdominal pain, vomiting, and right lower abdominal pain every 15-30 minutes suggests Meckel diverticulum, the most common underlying cause. The concentric rings of bowel on ultrasound are consistent with the presence of Meckel diverticulum. Malrotation with volvulus may also present with abdominal pain, vomiting, and hemoglobin concentration can be low, but the pain is not usually intermittent and tends to persist. Intestinal polyps and intestinal adhesions are less common causes."
