Option (C) is the opposite of what would be expected in hyperaldosteronism, which is excessive aldosterone production leading to sodium retention and potassium loss. The correct answer is therefore (D), which suggests low plasma renin levels due to excessive aldosterone production."

The patient\u2019s hypertension, headaches, and muscle cramping are consistent with a diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn syndrome), which is characterized by excess aldosterone production. However, none of the answer choices are directly related to aldosterone levels. The presence of a right-sided adrenal mass and the low potassium level in the labs suggest a diagnosis of adrenal adenoma, which is a common cause of primary hyperaldosteronism. Low plasma renin levels are typically seen in this condition."
