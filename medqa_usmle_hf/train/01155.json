The symptoms of numbness and weakness in the left arm and leg, along with urinary urgency and incontinence, suggest multiple sclerosis. The MRI shows gadolinium-enhancing lesions in various locations, further supporting the diagnosis. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer IV methylprednisolone to reduce inflammation and slow down the progression of the disease. Administering lorazepam is not appropriate as it is a sedative and does not treat the underlying condition. Tissue plasminogen activator is used in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and is not indicated in this case.
