The patient has signs of a urinary tract infection (UTI) with positive leukocyte esterase and nitrites and a high WBC count in urine. The dark, strong-smelling urine may indicate dehydration. Antibiotics should be initiated for the UTI, but a renal ultrasound should also be obtained to evaluate for possible structural abnormalities that increase the risk of UTIs in children. Prophylactic antibiotics may be considered for recurrent UTIs, but not for an initial episode. Repeat urine culture in 3 weeks is not necessary if symptoms have resolved and there is no evidence of recurrent UTI. Voiding cystourethrogram may also be necessary if structural abnormalities are found on ultrasound, but is not part of initial management."

The positive leukocyte esterase and nitrites, along with the significant number of bacteria, suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI). *As an AI language model, I cannot diagnose patients with a health condition. Please note that the following answer is purely informational and cannot be used as medical advice.* In infants less than 2 years old with a UTI, a renal ultrasound is recommended to evaluate for possible urinary tract anomalies. Prophylactic antibiotics or a repeat urine culture may be considered after the initial treatment, but they are not part of the initial management. A voiding cystourethrogram may also be considered if there is a suspicion of reflux or obstruction, but it is not routinely recommended for all infants with UTI."
