Mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are all potential treatment options for bipolar disorder. The combination of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics is often used to treat acute manic episodes, while benzodiazepines can help with anxiety and agitation. ECT is typically reserved for more severe cases or when other treatments have failed."

The symptoms suggest a manic episode, which can be treated with mood stabilizers such as lithium or valproate, antipsychotics such as olanzapine or risperidone, benzodiazepines for agitation, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in severe cases.
