Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a condition in which abnormal proteins are found in the blood. Patients with MGUS are at increased risk of developing multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer that affects plasma cells. Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia is another type of blood cancer that can cause elevated levels of gamma globulin, but it typically presents with other symptoms such as anemia and enlarged lymph nodes. The leukemias listed are not typically associated with MGUS. Therefore, multiple myeloma is the most likely disease to develop over the course of the patient's condition."
