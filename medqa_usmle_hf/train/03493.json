The trochlear nerve supplies the superior oblique muscle, which is the only option that explains the patient's ocular symptoms. Oculomotor nerve damage would cause limitation of eye movement, ptosis, or an enlarged pupil. Retrobulbar hemorrhage would cause vision loss with a normal ocular exam. Dorsal midbrain damage would cause vertical gaze palsy, convergence retraction nystagmus, and light-near dissociation."

The patient's ocular symptoms, specifically the left eye hypertropia worsens with right gaze and when the patient tilts her head toward her left shoulder, are consistent with damage to the trochlear nerve. This nerve controls the superior oblique muscle, which is responsible for downward and outward eye movements. Damage to the oculomotor nerve would cause more generalized eye movement abnormalities, retrobulbar hemorrhage would cause vision loss, and dorsal midbrain damage would cause a combination of eye movement and other neurological abnormalities."
