The family history of high cholesterol and early myocardial infarctions raises suspicion for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), which is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder affecting the LDL receptor. Flat yellow patches on the eyelids (xanthelasmata) and hard yellow bumps around the ankles (xanthomas) are commonly seen in FH. Therefore, the most likely protein that is defective in this patient is the LDL receptor. Lipoprotein lipase is involved in the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, whereas VLDL receptor and Apoprotein E play roles in the metabolism of VLDL, another type of lipoprotein. None of these proteins are specifically associated with the clinical presentation described in the question."
