The patient's symptoms and low serum potassium level suggest hypokalemia, which can be caused by excessive aldosterone secretion, as seen in hyperaldosteronism. HCTZ can cause hypokalemia, but given the timeline of only 4 weeks since starting the medication, it is less likely to be the sole cause of the patient's hypokalemia. Options A, B, and D are unrelated to the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings."
