The presentation of erythematous nodules and yellow-white discharge suggests a diagnosis of gonorrhea, which is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The organism has protein pili that help it attach to the host tissue and evade the immune system, which may explain why the patient lacks immunity against it. Lipooligosaccharide and exotoxin are also virulence factors of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but protein pili are the most relevant in terms of the patient's lack of immunity. A vaccine for Neisseria gonorrhoeae is currently not available."
