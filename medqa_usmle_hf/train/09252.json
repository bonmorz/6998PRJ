The patient has symptoms of major depressive disorder and a history of ADHD and smoking, which make him a good candidate for bupropion. Bupropion acts on both norepinephrine and dopamine, making it a good choice for patients with depression and ADHD symptoms who are also trying to quit smoking. Other options like Amitriptyline and Valproic acid are used for other mood disorders or pain management. Fluoxetine is a good choice for depression but may increase the risk of suicidal ideation in this patient."
