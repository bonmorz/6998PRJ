The high potassium levels in the blood can cause cardiac arrhythmias, and peaked T waves suggest hyperkalemia. The most appropriate next step in management is intravenous calcium gluconate to counteract the hyperkalemia. Mannitol and sodium bicarbonate are not indicated in this scenario. Packed red blood cell transfusion is not necessary at this stage, as the patient\u2019s hemoglobin level is above 7 g/dL."
