Based on the information provided, the irregular bone trabeculae and star-shaped cells with long, cytoplasmic processes likely represent osteoblastic lesions caused by metastasis of prostate cancer. The cells described are likely osteoblasts, which exchange nutrients and waste products through gap junctions known as macula communicans. Therefore, the correct answer is (A). Zonula occludens, hemidesmosomes, and zonula adherens are not involved in this process."
