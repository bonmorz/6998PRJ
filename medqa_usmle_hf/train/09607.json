Oral roflumilast is a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor and is used for reducing the frequency of exacerbations in severe COPD but is not indicated in this patient. Oral theophylline is less effective than inhaled bronchodilators and can cause toxicity. Antibiotic therapy may be necessary if there is evidence of a bacterial infection, but it is not the most important management step in this patient."
