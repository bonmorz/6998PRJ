This study is a retrospective cohort study because the investigators started with a group of patients who did not have syphilis and followed them over time to determine whether active cocaine use was associated with a higher rate of syphilis. A case-control study would have started with patients who have syphilis and compared them to patients without syphilis. A meta-analysis is a statistical method for combining the results of multiple studies, and a cross-sectional study involves collecting data at a single point in time."
