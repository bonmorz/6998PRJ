The patient has generalized pain, tenderness/pain of the extremities, and a medical history of alcohol abuse, all of which suggest the possibility of fibromyalgia. Hypercalcemia is associated with multiple myeloma, which is characterized by the presence of Bence Jones proteins but this is not consistent with the patient's laboratory values. Obstructive jaundice may be associated with pancreatic cancer, which is relevant to the patient's history of repeat episodes of pancreatitis, but this would likely be associated with elevated bilirubin levels. The only option that may be associated with fibromyalgia is hearing loss, which has been reported in some studies."

Obstructive jaundice is not associated with the patient\u2019s symptoms or laboratory values.

Hearing loss has been associated with fibromyalgia, likely due to the nervous system involvement. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) hearing loss."

Bence Jones proteins are not specific to multiple myeloma, but their presence in urine can support the diagnosis. Obstructive jaundice is not associated with multiple myeloma. Thus, choice (C) is the correct answer."

The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible diagnosis of fibromyalgia, which is associated with generalized pain and tenderness of the extremities. Elevated alkaline phosphatase levels suggest possible liver or bone disease, but the normal calcium level rules out hypercalcemia. There is no mention of proteinuria or bone pain, which would be associated with multiple myeloma and the presence of Bence Jones proteins. Obstructive jaundice is also unlikely given the normal liver function tests. Hearing loss can be associated with alcohol abuse, which the patient has a history of. Therefore, (A) hearing loss is the most appropriate answer."
