The fact that his nasal discharge has turned yellowish further supports this diagnosis. The most appropriate next step in management would be to start an oral antibiotic, such as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, which is effective against the most common pathogens causing acute sinusitis. Intravenous amphotericin B is used for fungal infections and should not be used in this case. Oral levofloxacin is also an option, but amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is preferred as initial treatment for acute sinusitis. Oral loratadine is an antihistamine and would not be effective for the treatment of bacterial sinusitis."
