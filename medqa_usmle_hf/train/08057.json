The patient has a metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap and respiratory compensation, as seen from the bicarbonate level and PaCO2.

Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis occurs when there is a loss of bicarbonate without a corresponding increase in chloride. In this case, the bicarbonate level is low (19 mEq/L) and the chloride level is high (115 mEq/L), indicating loss of bicarbonate through diarrhea. The respiratory compensation is appropriate as shown by the normal PaO2 and Pco2 levels. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) non-anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation."
