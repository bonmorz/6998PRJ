Menkes disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene, which codes for a protein involved in copper transport. The decreased activity of lysyl oxidase, which requires copper as a cofactor, is responsible for the connective tissue defects seen in Menkes disease. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) lysyl oxidase."

The symptoms described in the question suggest Menkes disease, a disorder that affects copper transport and metabolism. The enzyme responsible for this transport is ATP7A, and a mutation in this enzyme causes Menkes disease. Lysyl oxidase is not related to copper metabolism but is responsible for cross-linking collagen and elastin in the extracellular matrix. The other enzymes listed are not relevant to Menkes disease."
