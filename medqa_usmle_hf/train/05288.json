The patient has a history of upper abdominal pain that subsides after taking ibuprofen, which may suggest cholecystitis.

Cecal torsion and bowel infarction usually present with more severe symptoms and signs, and viscus perforation would likely show free air on imaging. The dry mucous membranes suggest dehydration, which is common in cases of prolonged vomiting and bowel obstruction."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including intermittent abdominal pain and vomiting, suggest a possible gastrointestinal issue.

The other options, including cecal torsion, bowel infarction, and viscus perforation, are possible causes of abdominal pain and other symptoms, but are not supported by the information given in the question stem."
