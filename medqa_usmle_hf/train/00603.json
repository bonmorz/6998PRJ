The most likely finding on abdominal imaging would be a gallstone lodged in the cystic duct. A dilated common bile duct with intrahepatic biliary dilatation might suggest an obstruction in the common bile duct, but this is not as likely to be seen in acute cholecystitis. Fistula formation between the gallbladder and bowel is a possible complication of chronic cholecystitis, but it would not be seen acutely. Decreased echogenicity of the liver is not a specific finding and could be seen with a variety of liver pathologies, but it is not directly related to acute cholecystitis."
