The patient has a history of working in construction and a ship dry-dock, which puts him at an increased risk for asbestos exposure. The bilateral crackles and bilateral infiltrates suggest interstitial lung disease, and the CT scan shows pleural scarring. Asbestosis is a type of interstitial lung disease caused by inhalation of asbestos fibers, making it the most likely explanation in this case. Drug-induced interstitial lung disease typically occurs with prolonged or high-dose use of certain medications, which is not the case here. Sarcoidosis typically presents with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and noncaseating granulomas on biopsy, which are not seen in this case. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis typically presents with asthma-like symptoms and eosinophilia, which are not seen in this case."

The patient has a history of working at a ship dry-dock for 15 years, which suggests exposure to asbestos, and chest X-ray reveals bilateral infiltrates at the lung bases, which is a common finding in asbestosis. Pulmonary function tests also show decreased total lung volume, another characteristic finding in asbestosis. The patient also recently started amlodipine, but the onset of symptoms before starting the medication suggests that drug-induced interstitial lung disease is less likely. Sarcoidosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis are also possible diagnoses, but the patient's history of occupational exposure and radiographic findings make asbestosis the most likely explanation."
