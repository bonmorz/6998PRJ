The symptoms presented by the patient suggest Meckel diverticulum, as it is common in children and presents with abdominal pain that starts around the umbilicus and radiates to the right lower quadrant, accompanied by vomiting. The concentric rings of bowel seen on ultrasound can also be a characteristic finding of Meckel diverticulum. Appendicitis usually presents with pain starting around the belly button and later moving to the right lower quadrant, and malrotation with volvulus presents with bilious vomiting and a distended abdomen, which are not seen in this patient. Intestinal adhesions may be a cause of recurrent abdominal pain, but they do not present with the specific symptoms seen in this case."

The ultrasound finding of concentric rings of bowel also supports this diagnosis. Intestinal adhesions might cause abdominal pain and bowel obstruction, but they are less likely to cause location-specific pain and vomiting. Acute appendicitis typically causes right lower quadrant pain without radiation to the umbilical region. Malrotation with volvulus can cause vomiting and abdominal pain, but it usually presents earlier in life and with more severe symptoms."

Intestinal adhesions may cause similar symptoms, but the ultrasound findings would be different. Acute appendicitis may also cause lower right abdominal pain, but the drawn-up knees and concentric rings on ultrasound are not typical.

The symptoms of acute intermittent umbilical abdominal pain that radiates to the right lower abdomen and periumbilical tenderness suggest a possible diagnosis of Meckel diverticulum.

Intestinal adhesions typically present with chronic abdominal pain and distension, while acute appendicitis presents with pain that initially starts in the periumbilical region before migrating to the right lower quadrant. Malrotation with volvulus can present with similar symptoms but typically presents earlier in infancy with bilious vomiting and a distended abdomen."

The patient's symptoms suggest acute appendicitis, but the ultrasound shows concentric rings of bowel in transverse section, which is highly suggestive of a Meckel diverticulum. This condition occurs in 2% of the population and can cause symptoms that mimic acute appendicitis. The leukocyte count and abdominal tenderness suggest an inflammatory process, which can occur with either condition. Intestinal adhesions are usually caused by prior surgery or infection, and malrotation with volvulus typically presents with bilious vomiting, which this patient does not have."
