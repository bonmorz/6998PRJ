The patient\u2019s sore throat 3 weeks ago and subsequent symptoms suggest acute rheumatic fever, which can cause migratory joint pain and subcutaneous nodules. Arthrocentesis reveals no organisms, making septic arthritis less likely. Lyme disease does not typically cause joint involvement as severe as described in this case. Kawasaki disease typically presents with fever, lymphadenopathy, and mucocutaneous changes, and is more common in younger children. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a possible differential diagnosis, but the patient\u2019s history and symptoms point more strongly to acute rheumatic fever."

Kawasaki disease would typically present with fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and coronary artery involvement. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis would typically present with joint symptoms for at least 6 weeks before a diagnosis is made."
