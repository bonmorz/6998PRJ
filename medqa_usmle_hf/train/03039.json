Two main reasons for surgical repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are rupture and symptoms such as abdominal, back, or groin pain. Smoking history is a risk factor for the development of an AAA but is not an indication for surgical repair. A growth of < 0.5 cm in one year is less than the normal rate of growth for an AAA and is not an indication for surgical repair unless there are other symptoms or risk factors.
