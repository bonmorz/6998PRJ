The patient appears to be experiencing symptoms of adjustment disorder with depressed mood, which is characterized by a persistent low mood and difficulty functioning after a stressful life event.

Option (C) is incorrect as symptoms can present up to 6 months after the stressor. Option (D) is not entirely accurate as symptoms may persist beyond 2 years in some cases."
