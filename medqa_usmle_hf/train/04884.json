The symptoms and history suggest that the patient is experiencing a Type I hypersensitivity reaction, also known as an immediate or IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Peanut butter is a common allergen that can trigger this type of reaction. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, and can include itching, hives, swelling, shortness of breath, and anaphylaxis. The patient's facial flushing, scratching, and audible stridor suggest an anaphylactic reaction, which is a severe and potentially life-threatening complication of Type I hypersensitivity."
