The patient\u2019s breast cancer is estrogen- and progesterone receptor-positive, which means that hormone therapy is a suitable treatment option. Among the options, only inhibiting the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogen with aromatase inhibitors can effectively reduce estrogen levels in the body and prevent further growth of the cancer cells. Cell cycle arrest is a mechanism of action for chemotherapy, but the patient specifically asks not to be treated like her mother did. Antagonizing estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus is not a suitable treatment option for breast cancer. Estrogen receptor downregulation in the breast can be achieved with tamoxifen, but the patient\u2019s cancer is also progesterone receptor-positive, which means that aromatase inhibitors are more effective."

Option B is a mechanism of action of estrogen receptor antagonists, which are used in the treatment of breast cancer that is not hormone receptor-positive. Option D is the opposite of the desired effect - downregulation of estrogen receptors in the breast would ultimately lead to less inhibition of cancer growth by estrogen."

The patient\u2019s cancer is estrogen- and progesterone receptor-positive, so hormone therapy is a suitable treatment option. The mechanism of action of aromatase inhibitors (such as anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane) is to inhibit peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogen, reducing the amount of estrogen available to stimulate the growth of hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells. Cell cycle arrest is a mechanism of action of chemotherapy drugs, but the question asks for the mechanism of action of the best treatment option for this patient. Antagonists for estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus are used to treat breast cancer in premenopausal women, but this patient has had her last menstrual period 10 years ago. Estrogen receptors downregulation in the breast is a mechanism of action of selective estrogen receptor modulators (such as tamoxifen), not aromatase inhibitors."
