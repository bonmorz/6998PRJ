The structure marked with an arrow is a rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is responsible for protein synthesis and modification. However, in minimal change disease, the characteristic feature is the absence of visible changes in the glomeruli by light microscopy, with effacement (flattening) of the foot processes of epithelial cells (podocytes) in electron microscopy. Therefore, the correct answer should be none of the given options. However, if we assume that the image is of a healthy glomerulus, then option (C) would be the most appropriate as ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is produced in the nucleolus of the nucleus and then transported into the rough ER for translation into protein."

The structure marked with an arrow is the nucleus, which contains the genetic material (DNA) and is responsible for producing rRNA. Therefore, the process that occurs in the structure marked with an arrow is the production of rRNA. This process is important for the assembly of ribosomes, which are involved in the synthesis of proteins in cells. However, it is not directly related to the diagnosis or treatment of minimal change disease."
