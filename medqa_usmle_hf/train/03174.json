The patient has a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are risk factors for stroke. The sudden onset of slurred speech and left facial droop for the past 30 minutes is consistent with a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is a warning sign of an impending stroke. The patient also had a carotid bruit, suggesting atherosclerotic plaque build-up. The symptoms resolved on the way back from the CT scan, which is typical of a TIA. Conversion disorder, partial seizure, and multiple sclerosis are less likely diagnoses for this patient."

The patient\u2019s risk factors for stroke, including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking, further support this diagnosis. A partial seizure would have different symptoms, such as jerking movements, confusion, or loss of consciousness. Multiple sclerosis would present with a variety of neurological symptoms that are typically progressive and not sudden like a TIA. Conversion disorder is a possibility but less likely given the patient\u2019s risk factors for stroke and the resolution of symptoms."

The patient\u2019s symptoms of slurred speech, left facial droop, numbness on the left side of her face, and a right-sided carotid bruit suggest a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain. The fact that her symptoms resolved on their own reinforces this likelihood. Conversion disorder and partial seizure do not fit with the presentation. Multiple sclerosis is a possibility but a noncontrast CT scan showed no abnormalities, which makes TIA the more likely diagnosis."
