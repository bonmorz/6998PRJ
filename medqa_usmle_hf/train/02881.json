However, patients taking glucocorticoids or with rheumatoid arthritis may have a reduced response to the vaccine, which is why immunoglobulin is added to provide immediate protection until their own antibodies can develop. Option B is the correct answer as it explains the rationale behind administering both tetanus toxoid and immunoglobulin. Option A is incorrect as tetanus toxoid should still be administered, even if the patient is taking glucocorticoids. Option C is incorrect as there is no age limit for receiving tetanus prophylaxis. Option D is incorrect as the duration of protection provided by immunoglobulin varies and depends on the dose administered."

Methylprednisolone does not affect the patient's immune response to tetanus toxoid, so it is still reasonable to administer tetanus toxoid. However, because the wound is contaminated and the patient's vaccination history is uncertain, both tetanus toxoid and immunoglobulin should be given. Immunoglobulin provides immediate passive immunity until the patient's own antibodies develop, but the protection is short-lived (approximately 2-4 weeks). Therefore, the patient will still need the tetanus toxoid vaccine to induce active immunity and provide long-term protection. Option A is incorrect because oral glucocorticoids do not interfere with the immune response to tetanus toxoid. Option C is incorrect because there is no upper age limit for tetanus toxoid administration. Option D is incorrect because the duration of protection provided by immunoglobulin is shorter than 4 months."

Option A is incorrect because although glucocorticoids can suppress the immune system, they do not completely prevent the development of immune response to vaccines. Option B is correct; administering both tetanus toxoid and immunoglobulin will provide immediate protection against tetanus infection while the patient's own immune system takes time to produce antibodies. Option C is incorrect because age alone is not a contraindication for tetanus toxoid administration. Option D is incorrect because immunoglobulin administration provides temporary immunity, not constant levels of antibodies for more than 4 months."
