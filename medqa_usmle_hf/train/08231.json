The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and a widely split first heart sound with a holosystolic murmur loudest over the left sternal border, indicating an atrial septal defect. Visible cyanosis suggests the presence of Eisenmenger syndrome. Lithium is a mood stabilizer that can cause fetal cardiac abnormalities, including Ebstein anomaly and atrial septal defects. Therefore, Lithium is the most likely medication that the patient was exposed to prenatally."
