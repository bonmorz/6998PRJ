The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest Gallstone pancreatitis, which is characterized by abdominal discomfort, elevated lipase and amylase, and radiation of pain to the back. Cholelithiasis and acute cholecystitis present with similar symptoms, but elevated bilirubin suggests obstruction of the common bile duct, making a diagnosis of choledocholithiasis more likely. However, the elevated lipase and amylase make gallstone pancreatitis the most likely diagnosis."

The radiation of pain to the back is another common symptom of gallstone pancreatitis. Cholecystitis presents with right upper quadrant tenderness, while choledocholithiasis presents with jaundice and obstruction of the common bile duct. Cholelithiasis presents with no inflammation or obstruction."
