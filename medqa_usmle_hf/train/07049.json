The patient is hypotensive and has signs of reduced cardiac output (low cardiac index and low PCWP) with a high systemic vascular resistance. These findings are consistent with hypovolemic shock, likely from significant fluid loss due to the unknown cause of unconsciousness. Septic shock would show a low systemic vascular resistance and high PCWP, while neurogenic shock would show a low systemic vascular resistance and normal PCWP. Cardiogenic shock would show a low cardiac index and high PCWP."
