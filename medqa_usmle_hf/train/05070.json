The patient has a history of scraping his left knee and a recent onset of pain and swelling in the left knee along with fever, suggesting septic arthritis. Arthrocentesis of the left knee is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and obtain fluid for culture and sensitivity testing. Bone scan and MRI are not first-line tests for the diagnosis of septic arthritis. Blood cultures should be obtained in addition to joint fluid cultures, but arthrocentesis is needed to confirm the diagnosis."
