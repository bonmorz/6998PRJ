The patient\u2019s symptoms, including involuntary lip smacking and hand and leg movements, suggest tardive dyskinesia, which is a side effect of long-term use of antipsychotic medications such as fluphenazine. Risperidone is also an antipsychotic medication, but it has weaker dopamine antagonism, which may explain the patient\u2019s improvement. Weaker acetylcholine antagonism or agonism and weaker histamine agonism do not explain the patient\u2019s improvement in this case."
