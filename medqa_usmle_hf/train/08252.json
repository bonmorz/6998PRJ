The CAAT box and DNA methyltransferase are involved in gene regulation but not as directly involved in the initiation of transcription as the TATA box. Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (SnRNPs) are involved in RNA splicing, not transcription initiation. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) TATA Box."
