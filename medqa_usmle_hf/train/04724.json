The symptoms described point to Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, which is caused by compression of the median nerve at the wrist. The inability to oppose the thumb to other digits is a classic sign of this syndrome. Flattened hypothenar eminence and atrophied adductor pollicis muscle are indicative of ulnar nerve damage, which is not relevant to this patient's symptoms. Paresthesia over the thenar eminence is another classic sign of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, but it is not as specific as the inability to oppose the thumb."
