The size of the mass is small (less than 2 cm) and there is no distant metastatic disease, which suggests stage I breast cancer. Lumpectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy, followed by radiation and hormone therapy, is the standard of care for stage I breast cancer, as it has been found to be just as effective as mastectomy with lower morbidity rates. The fact that the tumor is positive for estrogen receptors suggests that hormone therapy should also be administered. Nipple-sparing mastectomy is not necessary in this situation, as the tumor is located away from the nipple-areolar complex and there are no changes in the skin or nipple. Radical mastectomy is too aggressive for stage I breast cancer."
