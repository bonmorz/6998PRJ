The patient is presenting with symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon, joint pain and stiffness, unintentional weight loss, and laboratory results of anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, and decreased haptoglobin. These suggest that the patient most likely has systemic sclerosis, which can affect multiple organ systems, including the renal system. Ramipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, can be used to manage hypertension and improve kidney function in patients with systemic sclerosis. Nitroprusside and labetalol are used in hypertensive emergencies, but the patient does not have a hypertensive emergency. Dialysis is not indicated at this time."
