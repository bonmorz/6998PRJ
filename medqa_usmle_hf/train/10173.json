The patient is presenting with symptoms of hyponatremia, which is confirmed by the laboratory results showing low serum sodium level and low urine specific gravity. The clear urine also suggests a potential issue with ADH regulation. Thus, the best next step in management would be to administer desmopressin, which is a synthetic analogue of ADH that can help increase water reabsorption in the kidneys and improve serum sodium levels. Administering hypotonic fluids would only exacerbate the hyponatremia, and performing a head CT would only be indicated if there were other neurological symptoms or signs. Demeclocycline can also be used to treat hyponatremia, but it is less commonly used and has more potential side effects than desmopressin."
