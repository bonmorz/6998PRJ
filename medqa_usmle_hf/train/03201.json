The chest radiograph reveals bilateral infiltrates, and the patient has been treated for community-acquired pneumonia with no improvement.

Given the patient\u2019s history of long-term steroid use and respiratory failure, adding steroids to the treatment is the best option. Therefore, the best treatment strategy for this patient is Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole + steroids."

The patient\u2019s past medical history, chest radiograph, and initial treatment for pneumonia suggest that the patient has Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). This is confirmed by the presence of organisms in the induced sputum samples. Treatment for PCP typically involves the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). However, since the patient has been on long-term dexamethasone therapy, which can suppress the immune system and increase the risk of PCP, a combination of TMP-SMX and steroids is the best treatment strategy."
