Proteus mirabilis can also cause pyelonephritis, but it grows swarming colonies on blood agar and is unlikely to grow on eosin methylene blue agar. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of UTI in hospitalized patients, but it grows greenish colonies on blood agar and is oxidase-positive. Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a common cause of UTI in sexually active young women, but it grows non-hemolytic colonies on blood agar and is coagulase-negative."
