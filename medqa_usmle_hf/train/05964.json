The non-tender twisted mass along the left spermatic cord that disappears when the patient lies supine indicates a spermatic cord torsion. The left testicular vein drains into the left renal vein which then travels to the inferior vena cava, and decreased laminar flow at this vascular junction can lead to spermatic cord torsion. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) left testicular vein - left renal vein."

Option B is the correct answer for testicular pain caused by an acute testicular torsion, but the description of the mass disappearing with supine position makes it less likely. Option C refers to abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is not related to testicular pain. Option D is incorrect as the left internal iliac vein does not drain the testicle."
