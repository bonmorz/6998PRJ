The patient's symptoms suggest weakness and the absence of elevated ESR and creatine kinase levels rules out polymyositis. Mononeuritis multiplex is characterized by asymmetric weakness but there are no sensory symptoms mentioned in the case. Polymyalgia rheumatica would have resolved jaw pain, which the patient still experiences. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is drug-induced myopathy, which can occur as a result of treatment for temporal arteritis."

The resolution of the patient's headaches, jaw pain, and visual disturbances suggests that the arteritis is under control. The weakness is likely due to a drug-induced myopathy, as the initial laboratory work-up showed normal levels of ESR and creatine kinase. Mononeuritis multiplex and polymyositis would present with more widespread weakness, while polymyalgia rheumatica would not typically cause weakness."

The previous diagnosis of arteritis would likely have been treated with steroids, which can cause myopathy. It is important to also consider other medications the patient may be taking. Mononeuritis multiplex presents with asymmetric sensorimotor deficits, and polymyalgia rheumatica presents with pain and stiffness in the shoulders and hips, whereas the patient's weakness is more widespread. Polymyositis would also present with weakness, but would be associated with elevated creatine kinase levels."

The fact that ESR and creatine kinase levels are within normal limits make polymyositis less likely. The lack of involvement of individual nerves suggests mononeuritis multiplex is not the most likely diagnosis. Polymyalgia rheumatica may cause muscle pain and stiffness, but not weakness. Finally, the patient\u2019s biopsy revealed arteritis, which may be treated with glucocorticoids, but this therapy may also cause drug-induced myopathy as a side effect. Therefore, drug-induced myopathy is the most likely diagnosis."
