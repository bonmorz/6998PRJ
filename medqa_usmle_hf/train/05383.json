The patient's presentation is most consistent with reperfusion associated edema, which occurs when blood flow is restored to ischemic tissue too quickly. This can occur after prolonged cold exposure, such as in this patient's case, and can cause swelling and loss of sensation. Cellulitis typically presents with redness, warmth, and tenderness, but does not cause loss of sensation. Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly spreading bacterial infection that would likely present with more severe pain and signs of systemic infection. Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder and is not the most probable cause for this patient's acute symptoms."

Reperfusion associated edema is the most probable cause of this patient's condition. While cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis can be complications of frostbite, they do not explain the loss of sensation or compartment syndrome. Diabetes is not relevant to the scenario presented."

Diabetes is also less likely as there is no history of diabetes and the presentation does not fit diabetic neuropathy or complications."
