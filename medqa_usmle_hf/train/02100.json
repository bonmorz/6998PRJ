The patient\u2019s history of being struck on the outside of the leg while playing soccer followed by swelling and instability of the knee suggest a medial meniscal tear. The bruising over the leg, knee, and lateral thigh may be a result of the trauma from being struck. The minor clicking and catching during passive range of motion may be due to the unstable meniscus in the joint. Anterior cruciate and posterior cruciate ligament tears may also cause instability but are less likely given the mechanism of injury. Iliotibial band syndrome typically causes lateral knee pain, not instability. Imaging will confirm the diagnosis."

The presence of bruising and edema of her knee also support an injury. Passive range of motion showing minor clicking and catching of the joint points to a meniscal tear. The instability and lack of confidence bearing weight on the leg suggest a torn meniscus. The other options would have different signs and symptoms. Anterior cruciate ligament tear would cause a feeling of instability, swelling, and difficulty with weight-bearing activities. Posterior cruciate ligament tear would cause swelling, pain, and instability. Iliotibial band syndrome would cause lateral knee pain, but not necessarily swelling or instability."

Anterior cruciate ligament tear may result in an unstable knee but is usually associated with a sudden pivoting injury, which is not described in this case. Posterior cruciate ligament tears may also result in an unstable knee, but they are less common than anterior cruciate ligament tears and are also associated with a different mechanism of injury.
