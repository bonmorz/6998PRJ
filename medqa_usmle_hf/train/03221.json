It involves comparing a provider's prescribing patterns with those of their peers in the same area or institution and providing feedback to the provider. The other options - CRP testing, procalcitonin testing, and testing for non-antibiotic-appropriate diagnoses - may be useful in specific cases but are not as effective in reducing overall inappropriate prescribing."
