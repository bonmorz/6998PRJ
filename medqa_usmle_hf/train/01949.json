The patient\u2019s increased calcium and PTH levels suggest hyperparathyroidism, which can be a complication of chronic hypertension. Chronic hypertension can cause damage to the parathyroid gland and lead to hyperplasia or adenoma development. Medullary thyroid cancer is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), which includes pheochromocytoma as a symptom. Therefore, it is a potential complication in this patient's condition.
