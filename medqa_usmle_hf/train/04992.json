Childhood history is the most critical detail to diagnose this condition as it is characterized by a pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others since age 15. This means that childhood behaviors like cruelty to animals, fighting, truancy, and running away from home are crucial for a diagnosis. Family history, lack of remorse and criminal record alone cannot confirm the diagnosis."
