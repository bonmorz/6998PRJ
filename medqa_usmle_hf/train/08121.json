The symptoms, laboratory results, and immunofluorescence findings suggest Berger\u2019s disease (IgA nephropathy), which is a common cause of isolated hematuria in young adults with a history of recurrent respiratory infections or gastrointestinal infections. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can also cause hematuria, but it is usually associated with proteinuria and decreased C3 levels. Hemolytic uremic syndrome usually presents with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. Celiac disease is not typically associated with hematuria."

The patient presents with a history of multiple episodes of hematuria as a child, pharyngeal edema, cervical lymphadenopathy, and an ASO titer of 100, suggesting a recent streptococcal infection. The combination of gross hematuria, pharyngitis, and a history of recurrent hematuria is strongly suggestive of Berger\u2019s disease, which is characterized by IgA deposition in the glomerulus. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is another possibility, but typically occurs 1-4 weeks after a streptococcal infection and is more common in children. Hemolytic uremic syndrome is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure, which are not present in this patient. Celiac disease is not related to the patient\u2019s symptoms."
