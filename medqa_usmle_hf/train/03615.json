Lisinopril can cause further hypotension and should be withheld, while IV fluids can help increase blood pressure. Fludrocortisone can also help increase blood pressure, but it is not the next best step in management. IV norepinephrine is a more aggressive treatment for hypotension and should only be considered if IV fluids and withholding lisinopril are ineffective. Further laboratory tests and an ECG are needed to fully evaluate the patient\u2019s condition."

Administering IV norepinephrine is not necessary at this time. Administering oral fludrocortisone may be an option for long-term management of hypotension, but not for acute management."

The patient had substantial blood loss during surgery and is now presenting with symptoms of weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure when standing.

Administering IV norepinephrine may be necessary if the patient\u2019s blood pressure does not respond to fluids and withholding lisinopril, but it is not the next best step in management. Administering fludrocortisone, a medication that mimics the effects of aldosterone, is not indicated in this case."
