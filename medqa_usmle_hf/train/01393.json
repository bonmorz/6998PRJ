The ECG shows a regular narrow QRS tachycardia with a rate of 194 bpm, which is suggestive of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The fact that gentle massage over the carotid artery did not terminate her palpitations suggests that the patient has a stable SVT. Verapamil is effective for terminating SVT and is the most appropriate next step. Adenosine is another medication used to terminate SVT, but it would be given as a rapid intravenous push rather than orally. Amiodarone and digoxin are not effective for terminating SVT."
