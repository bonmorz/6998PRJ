The drug of choice for this patient is benzodiazepines, which work by increasing the duration of chloride channel opening of GABA-A receptors.

This drug can help alleviate psychosis and agitation caused by phencyclidine."

Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam and diazepam increase duration of chloride channel opening of GABA-A receptors and may provide additional sedation. However, the best alternative sedative drug for this patient is an antipsychotic agent that is a D2 receptor antagonist such as olanzapine, quetiapine, or droperidol, because it can control agitation and reduce the risk of dystonias and muscle rigidity."

The patient's symptoms suggest that the best alternative sedative drug would be an antagonist of D2 receptors, such as haloperidol. Phencyclidine acts on the NMDA receptor, causing hallucinations and altered mental status. Midazolam enhances the binding of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, to the GABA-A receptor, increasing chloride influx and leading to sedation. Competitive opioid receptor antagonists, such as naloxone, are used to treat opioid overdose. Mu-opioid receptor partial agonists, such as buprenorphine, are used for opioid dependence treatment."
