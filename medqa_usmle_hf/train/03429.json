The clinical features suggest hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) due to Rh incompatibility between the mother and the infant. Increased hemoglobin Barts concentration is a feature of alpha-thalassemia, which can be present in cases of severe HDN. Elevated HbF is seen in beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease, not HDN. Low serum ferritin suggests iron deficiency anemia, which is not likely in this case. Elevated HbA2 is seen in beta-thalassemia trait, not HDN."

The newborn\u2019s presentation is consistent with alpha-thalassemia, which is caused by the deletion of two or more alpha-globin genes. This leads to excess formation of gamma-globin chains and accumulation of hemoglobin Barts, which has a high affinity for oxygen and results in tissue hypoxia. Therefore, the most likely laboratory finding is increased hemoglobin Barts concentration. HbF is elevated in beta-thalassemia, which is caused by mutations in the beta-globin gene. Low serum ferritin is associated with iron deficiency anemia, and elevated HbA2 is seen in beta-thalassemia trait."
