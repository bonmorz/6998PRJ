The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest kleptomania, as he has an intense impulse to steal things that he doesn\u2019t need or have any use for, without any ill will towards the victims. Conduct disorder may be a consideration, but it typically involves aggressive behavior towards others and violation of societal norms beyond stealing. Manic episode and schizophrenia are unlikely diagnoses based on the patient\u2019s symptoms."
