The concentration gradient of Na+ and K+ ions across the cell membrane is critical to the proper function of excitable cells. The high concentration of Na+ outside the cell and high concentration of K+ inside the cell creates an electrochemical gradient, making the inside of the cell more negative than the outside, establishing the resting membrane potential. Option A is correct, while options B, C, and D are all incorrect because they don't have the correct concentration gradient for either cations or anions."

Option A best explains the phenomenon of membrane potential, as there is a high concentration of positively charged sodium ions outside the cell and a high concentration of positively charged potassium ions inside the cell. This creates an electrical gradient that contributes to the generation of the membrane potential. Option B is incorrect, as there is typically a higher concentration of K+ ions inside the cell rather than outside.

The highest concentration of Na+ exists outside the cell membrane while the highest concentration of K+ exists inside the cell membrane. Therefore, option (A) best explains the phenomenon. Option (B) is incorrect as the concentration of K+ inside the cell should be high, not low. Option (C) is incorrect as Ca2+ is not one of the major contributors to membrane potential. Option (D) is incorrect as Cl- is a negatively charged ion and therefore cannot contribute to membrane potential alone."

Excitable cells, such as neurons and muscle cells, generate membrane potential through the differential distribution of ions across the cell membrane. The resting membrane potential of excitable cells is primarily determined by the concentration gradient of K+ ions across the cell membrane. The concentration of K+ ions is higher inside the cell, which creates a negative potential inside the cell relative to the outside. The concentration of Na+ ions is higher outside the cell, which creates a positive potential outside the cell relative to the inside. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer, as it describes the differential distribution of Na+ and K+ ions necessary for generation of the membrane potential in excitable cells. Options (B), (C), and (D) do not accurately describe the distribution of ions necessary for generation of the membrane potential."

In excitable cells, the resting membrane potential is generated by the differential distribution of ions across the cell membrane. The typical resting potential is around -70 mV and is generated by a high concentration of K+ inside the cell and a high concentration of Na+ outside the cell. This creates an electrochemical gradient that favors the movement of K+ out of the cell and Na+ into the cell. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Option B describes a situation where K+ ions move into the cell, which would result in depolarization of the cell membrane. Option C and D describe the distribution of different ions, which are not primarily responsible for generating the resting membrane potential."

Option (D) is incorrect because Cl- is not the primary ion involved in cell membrane potential, and the concentration gradient for Cl- is generally not as steep as for Na+ and K+."
