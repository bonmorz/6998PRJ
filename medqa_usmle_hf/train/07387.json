The leukocytosis and elevated neutrophils also support this diagnosis. The urine analysis shows only mild UTI and glucose in the absence of ketones suggests poorly controlled diabetes rather than diabetic ketoacidosis. Post-operative ileus does not usually cause fever and would not explain the other symptoms. Surgical error is possible but less likely given the uncomplicated surgery and absence of other findings suggestive of this."

Post-operative ileus and surgical error are less likely to present with these specific symptoms. Further evaluation of the surgical site, including possible wound cultures, is recommended."

Urinary tract infection may present with fever and leukocytosis, but the urinary specimen does not support this diagnosis. Surgical error would need more specific information to confirm."
