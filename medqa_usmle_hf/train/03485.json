Muddy brown casts in urine are indicative of AKI caused by rhabdomyolysis, which is the breakdown of muscle tissue. Urine output and BUN:Cr ratio are also used to diagnose AKI, and in this case, a low urine output and a BUN:Cr ratio <15:1 would be expected. Urinary osmolality is not specific to AKI and can vary based on factors such as fluid intake. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer."

The patient had a myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention which can cause acute kidney injury. Muddy brown casts in the urine and low urinary output suggest acute tubular necrosis, which has a BUN:Cr ratio less than 15:1. Urinary osmolality is not typically affected in acute tubular necrosis, so option B can be ruled out. Option A is incorrect because the normal range for urinary osmolality is 500-800 mOsmol/kg."

Muddy brown casts in the urine are indicative of acute tubular necrosis, which is a common cause of acute kidney injury in the setting of ischemic injury. The expected feature for this patient\u2019s condition is a BUN:Cr ratio < 15:1. This value is consistent with the diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis. Option A is not correct because a high urinary osmolality is indicative of prerenal causes of acute kidney injury, such as dehydration, rather than acute tubular necrosis. Option B is incorrect because the value is within the normal range for urinary osmolality. Option C is not correct because a BUN:Cr ratio > 20:1 is indicative of prerenal causes of acute kidney injury, such as dehydration, rather than acute tubular necrosis."

Since the patient is in the ICU with an acute injury, he is likely to have prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI), which is characterized by hypoperfusion of the kidneys. In prerenal AKI, urine output decreases, but the kidneys are still able to concentrate urine. Therefore, the urinary osmolality is expected to be high, in the range of 900 mOsmol/kg. A BUN:Cr ratio greater than 20:1 is also indicative of prerenal AKI, but in this case, the ratio is likely to be less than 15:1, as the patient\u2019s symptoms suggest an acute injury rather than chronic kidney disease."

The patient's symptoms and electrocardiogram suggest a myocardial infarction, and the subsequent treatment likely involved the use of intravenous fluids and medications. The subsequent low urinary output and presence of muddy brown casts suggest acute kidney injury, which is commonly seen in cases of ischemic injury to the kidneys. In this condition, both BUN and serum creatinine levels are elevated, but the BUN:Cr ratio is typically less than 20:1. Therefore, the most likely answer is (D), with a BUN:Cr ratio less than 15:1. Option (A) is incorrect because the urinary osmolality is usually reduced in cases of acute kidney injury due to impaired concentration ability. Option (B) is within the normal range and unlikely to be seen in a patient with acute kidney injury. Option (C) is incorrect because the BUN:Cr ratio is typically less than 20:1 in acute kidney injury, not greater than 20:1."

The patient had an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which can cause contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). The patient\u2019s low urine output and muddy brown casts suggest acute kidney injury (AKI) from CIN. In AKI, the BUN:Cr ratio is usually < 15:1, which is option D. Option A is incorrect because a high urinary osmolality suggests dehydration, which is not expected in this scenario. Option B is incorrect because normal urinary osmolality is 500-800 mOsmol/kg, so 550 mOsmol/kg would be considered normal. Option C is incorrect because a high BUN:Cr ratio is usually seen in prerenal AKI, which is caused by decreased blood flow to the kidneys, rather than in CIN."

The patient\u2019s presenting symptoms and ECG changes suggest acute coronary syndrome, which was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. The patient\u2019s subsequent oliguria and muddy brown casts suggest acute kidney injury (AKI), likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy. Therefore, we can expect the blood urea nitrogen (BUN):Serum creatinine ratio (Cr) to be < 15:1, as this indicates prerenal azotemia, which is commonly seen in AKI. Urinary osmolality is not a reliable indicator of AKI, as it may be affected by various factors such as hydration status and medications."
