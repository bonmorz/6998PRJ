Therefore, option B and D are incorrect. Urea is not reabsorbed in the collecting tubules, so option C is also incorrect. When sodium reabsorption is blocked, potassium secretion is also affected as they are exchanged in the collecting tubules. Therefore, option A is the most likely to be decreased upon drug administration."

Option (B) is incorrect as it is the opposite of the expected effect of blocking sodium channels. Option (C) is also incorrect as urea secretion is not primarily affected by cortical collecting duct function. Option (D) may be affected by drugs that block the sodium chloride co-transporter in the distal tubule, but not by blocking epithelial sodium channels in the cortical collecting duct."
