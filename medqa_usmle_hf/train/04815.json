The history of sore throat and the joint involvement suggest acute rheumatic fever, and the cardiac exam finding of a holosystolic murmur indicates valvular involvement.

High-dose glucocorticoids are used for severe cases, but are not the first-line pharmacotherapy. Amoxicillin is not effective for treating acute rheumatic fever.
