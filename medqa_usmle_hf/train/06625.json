Failure of fusion of the pancreatic buds can result in separate duct systems as seen in this patient.

The dorsal pancreatic bud is supposed to fuse with the ventral pancreatic bud during embryonic development to form the pancreas, but if this fusion doesn't occur properly, the dorsal pancreas may develop separately and drain into a separate duct. This can lead to pancreatitis and other complications, as seen in this patient. The other options do not relate to the development of the pancreas or its ducts, and are therefore less likely to be the cause of this patient's symptoms."
