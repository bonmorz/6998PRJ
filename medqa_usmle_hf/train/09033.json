Based on the patient's symptoms (regression in behavior, difficulty walking, repetitive hand movements), the most likely diagnosis is Rett Syndrome, which is an X-linked dominant disorder. This means that the affected gene is located on the X chromosome, and a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disorder. It predominantly affects females and is rarely seen in males, as they only have one X chromosome. Therefore, X-linked dominant is the most likely genetic pattern of inheritance responsible for this behavioral regression."

The behavioral regression and difficulty walking indicate a neurological disorder such as Rett syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene located on the X chromosome. X-linked dominant inheritance means the mutated gene only needs to be present on one of the two X chromosomes to cause the disorder, which is consistent with the fact that the patient is a girl.

The symptoms suggest a possibility of Rett Syndrome, which is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects girls almost exclusively due to mutations in the MECP2 gene on the X chromosome. X-linked dominant is a possible pattern of inheritance for Rett Syndrome. Autosomal dominant inheritance can be seen in conditions like Huntington's Disease, which typically presents later in life. X-linked recessive inheritance may cause conditions like Hemophilia A, but does not fit the symptoms described here. Chromosomal trisomy can cause conditions like Down Syndrome, but the symptoms and pattern of inheritance do not fit in this case."
