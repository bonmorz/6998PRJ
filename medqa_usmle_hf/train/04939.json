The patient has severe chronic neck pain, is experiencing suicidal ideation, and has access to a firearm, which puts him at high risk for suicide.

Outpatient options are not appropriate for a patient at this level of risk. Confiscating the gun alone does not address the patient's overall condition, and releasing him home without proper treatment and support would be unsafe."
