The patient's immunosuppressive therapy in combination with low neutrophil count (only 10%) suggests decreased phagocytic cell count, which can lead to susceptibility to fungal infections such as Candida. Defective IL-2 receptor is associated with T-cell immunodeficiency, failure to take suppressive trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy is associated with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and renal failure alone is not a risk factor for fungal infections, but it can contribute to immunosuppression."

The patient's immunosuppressive therapy suggests that he is at risk of infection, and his low neutrophil count (10% of WBC) suggests a decreased phagocytic cell count, which makes him more susceptible to infections. This is likely the predisposing factor for his infection with Candida species. The other options (defective IL-2 receptor, failure to take suppressive trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy, and renal failure) do not directly affect the patient's immune system and are less likely to be the predisposing factor for his infection."

The low neutrophil count suggests neutropenia, which is a predisposing factor for fungal infections such as Candida. Defective IL-2 receptors would increase the risk of viral infections, not fungal infections. Failure to take suppressive therapy for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia would increase the risk of bacterial infections, not fungal infections. Renal failure may increase the risk of infections but it is not directly related to fungal infections."

The differential count shows a low neutrophil count and a high lymphocyte count, suggesting decreased phagocytic cell count. This would predispose the patient to fungal infections such as Candida species. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. Defective IL-2 receptors may predispose to viral infections, failure to take suppressive trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy may predispose to bacterial infections, and renal failure may predispose to electrolyte imbalances but none of these directly predispose to fungal infections."
