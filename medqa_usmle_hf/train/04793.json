Achondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with complete penetrance, meaning that all individuals who inherit the mutated gene will exhibit symptoms of the condition. Answer choice (C) therefore represents the correct genetic phenomenon exhibited in this case. Answers (A), (B), and (D) are not related to the inheritance pattern of achondroplasia."
