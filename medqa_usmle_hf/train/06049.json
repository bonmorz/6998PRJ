Among the options, impaired opsonization can result in recurrent infections, as opsonization is a process where pathogenic microorganisms become coated with antibodies and complement proteins, making them more easily recognized by phagocytes. Impaired leukocyte adhesion and defective superoxide production are less likely to cause recurrent infections. Absence of IgA antibodies can cause recurrent infections, but not specifically streptococcal pneumonia and meningitis."
