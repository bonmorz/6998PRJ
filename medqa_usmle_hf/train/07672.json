Acute psychological stress would not cause such a long-lasting and progressive condition. There is no evidence of coronary artery occlusion.

The patient's symptoms such as dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and a dilated left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction points to heart failure. Chronic tachycardia can cause heart failure as it leads to increased demand on the heart and reduced time for diastolic filling. Amyloid deposition can cause restrictive cardiomyopathy, but the symptoms are not consistent with that diagnosis. Acute psychological stress and coronary artery occlusion are unlikely causes given the patient's medical history and examination findings."

The patient's symptoms suggest heart failure, and the dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 40% supports this diagnosis. Her history of Hodgkin lymphoma is not suggestive of amyloid deposition. Acute psychological stress is unlikely to cause such a significant deterioration in cardiac function. The absence of murmurs on cardiac examination makes coronary artery occlusion less likely. Chronic tachycardia, on the other hand, can lead to heart failure and may have been caused by her previous history of chemotherapy and radiation."
