The hepatitis B vaccine consists of a recombinant surface antigen of the virus that stimulates an immune response to produce antibodies to the virus. The first dose is intended to stimulate the production of IgM antibodies, which are the first antibodies produced in an acute immune response. Subsequent doses are intended to stimulate the production of IgG antibodies, which provide long-term protection against the virus. Therefore, the physician is trying to increase IgM antibodies with the first vaccination."
