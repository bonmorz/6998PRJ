The history of the patient's mother having von Willebrand's disease, the easy bruising and prolonged visible bruises, suggest that the patient may also have vWD. PTT (partial thromboplastin time) is prolonged in vWD due to a deficiency in von Willebrand factor, which is necessary for platelet function and clotting. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. The other options are not associated with vWD."

The symptoms of easy bruising and prolonged bleeding time suggest a possible diagnosis of von Willebrand's disease (vWD).

It is usually diagnosed by a combination of clinical bleeding symptoms and laboratory tests, with the most common abnormality being a prolonged PTT (partial thromboplastin time) due to impaired platelet function. Prolonged PT (prothrombin time) is associated with deficiencies in the extrinsic pathway of coagulation, such as factor VII or vitamin K deficiency. Normal bleeding time and decreased factor IX are not typical findings in vWD. The other symptoms described in the scenario, such as easy bruising and prolonged bleeding, also support the diagnosis of vWD."
