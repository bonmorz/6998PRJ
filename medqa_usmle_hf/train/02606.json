The occasional motor tics suggest Tourette's syndrome, but the common symptoms are vocal tics, not repetitive behaviors like combing hair. GAD may cause anxiety, but not necessarily repetitive behaviors. ASD is also not likely, as the patient\u2019s symptoms do not fit the usual diagnostic criteria."

There is no mention of social communication difficulties or restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities, suggesting that ASD is not the correct diagnosis. GAD involves excessive, persistent and unrealistic worry about their everyday lives, and there are no indications of that in the question stem."

The patient is exhibiting obsessive-compulsive behaviors, such as repeating counting and grooming behaviors, and becoming emotional when confronted about them. These behaviors are consistent with a diagnosis of OCD. Autism spectrum disorder involves persistent deficits in social communication and interaction, and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior. Generalized anxiety disorder involves excessive and persistent worry or anxiety about a number of events or activities. Tourette's syndrome involves the presence of multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic, with onset during childhood. While the patient does have occasional motor tics, they do not meet the criteria for Tourette's syndrome."
