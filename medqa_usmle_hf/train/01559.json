Expectant management is generally accepted as safe for women who are clinically stable, have a gestational sac without a visible embryo, and have no signs of an ectopic pregnancy. Methotrexate is used to treat ectopic pregnancies. Serial beta-hCG measurement is done to monitor the pregnancy and detect any complications, but it is not a treatment option. Oxytocin therapy is used to induce labor, but it is not appropriate in this case as the patient is already experiencing bleeding and cramping."

Serial beta-hCG measurements can be used to monitor a patient's condition after a miscarriage, but they are not needed for expectant management.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be expectant management, which involves monitoring without any intervention, as it allows for natural expulsion of the tissue and avoids invasive procedures. Methotrexate therapy is typically used for medically managing ectopic pregnancies. Serial beta-hCG measurement can help monitor the progression of the pregnancy but is not necessary in this situation. Oxytocin therapy is used to stimulate uterine contractions and is typically used for induction of labor, which is not necessary in this case."
