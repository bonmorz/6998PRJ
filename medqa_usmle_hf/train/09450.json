The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of diverticulitis, which includes lower abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and altered bowel movements. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count increase, which is often seen in diverticulitis. Of the options provided, CT scan of the abdomen with contrast is the most appropriate to confirm the diagnosis as it can identify inflammation, abscesses, and perforations in the colon. Abdominal ultrasound and x-ray can help with initial assessment, but may not be sufficient for diagnosis confirmation. Flexible sigmoidoscopy may also not be suitable for this purpose as it only assesses the distal colon."
