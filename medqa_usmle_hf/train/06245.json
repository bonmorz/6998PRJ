This autoimmune disorder causes painful blisters and erosions on the skin and mucous membranes. Metformin and glyburide are unlikely to be the cause of the blisters. Behcet disease causes oral and genital ulcers but not blisters on the forearms. Dermatitis herpetiformis presents with small itchy papules and vesicles on the elbows, knees, and buttocks. Toxic epidermal necrolysis presents with widespread epidermal detachment and skin necrosis."
