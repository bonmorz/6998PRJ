Histone deacetylase inhibitors cause an increase in acetylation of histones, leading to a more relaxed chromatin structure and increased expression of genes. This is due to the fact that acetylation neutralizes the positive charge of lysine, reducing its affinity for negatively charged DNA and relaxing DNA coiling. Therefore, the correct answer is B - relaxation of DNA coiling."

Histone deacetylases remove acetyl groups from histones, leading to tighter coiling of DNA and suppression of gene transcription.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors cause relaxation of DNA coiling, leading to increased access of transcription factors and RNA polymerase to genes, which can result in increased gene transcription. This can have therapeutic potential in cancer treatment as it can arrest the cell cycle and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Tighter coiling of DNA is associated with decreased gene expression and heterochromatin formation. Suppression of gene transcription is not typically associated with histone deacetylase inhibitors."

Histone deacetylase inhibitors lead to hyperacetylation of histones, which causes relaxation of DNA coiling and increased accessibility of genes for transcription.
