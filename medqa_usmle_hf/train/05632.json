Thus, the most likely diagnosis is Autism Spectrum Disorder, which can be diagnosed based on clinical observation and history alone without any further testing. MRI of the brain is not routinely indicated for diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. EEG may be helpful for diagnosing certain types of seizure disorders but is not indicated in this case. Testing for MECP-2 gene mutations is indicated only in cases where Rett Syndrome is suspected."

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, there are no specific diagnostic tests for autism spectrum disorder and diagnosis is based on a comprehensive developmental and behavioral evaluation by a healthcare professional. Therefore, no further testing is needed at present. MRI of the brain may be useful in ruling out other conditions but is not necessary for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Electroencephalography and genetic testing for MECP-2 gene mutations are not routinely used in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder."

Based on the information provided, it is likely that the child is experiencing difficulties with social interaction and attention, which are common symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In the absence of any physical or neurologic abnormalities, further testing may not be indicated at present, and a diagnosis of ADHD or ASD may be made based on clinical evaluation and behavioral assessments. Therefore, option (D) is the most appropriate answer. MRI of brain and EEG are not routinely indicated for the evaluation of ADHD or ASD unless there are specific clinical indications or concerns. Genetic testing for MECP-2 gene mutations may be considered in cases where there is a high suspicion of Rett syndrome or other genetic disorders, but this is not indicated based on the limited information provided in this scenario."
