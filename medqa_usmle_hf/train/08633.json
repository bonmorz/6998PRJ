The patient has gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which increases the risk of macrosomia and islet cell hyperplasia in the infant. None of the other options are directly associated with GDM.

Decreased hematocrit may occur in neonates with hemolytic anemia or polycythemia, but these conditions are not directly related to GDM."
