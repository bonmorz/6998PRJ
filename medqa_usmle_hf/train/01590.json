The patient has symptoms consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and a high free PSA level, indicating a higher risk of prostate cancer. Treatment for BPH can include 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, which work by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is the hormone that promotes prostate growth. Finasteride is a drug used to treat both BPH and male-pattern baldness as it inhibits the same 5-alpha reductase enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT in hair follicles. Alpha-1 blockers can also be used to treat BPH, but they do not address male-pattern baldness. Squalene epoxidase and 17,20-desmolase inhibitors are not used to treat BPH or male-pattern baldness."

The patient has symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate) and the high PSA level suggests prostate cancer is unlikely. Alpha-1 blockers (option A) are used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia by relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder. However, they do not treat male-pattern baldness. Squalene epoxidase inhibition (option B) is used to treat fungal infections, not urinary issues or male-pattern baldness. 17,20-desmolase inhibition (option D) is used to treat conditions involving the adrenal gland, but is not relevant to this patient's symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is 5-alpha reductase inhibition (option C), which is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is believed to contribute to prostate enlargement. This same mechanism of action is also used to treat male-pattern baldness, as DHT is involved in the miniaturization of hair follicles."
