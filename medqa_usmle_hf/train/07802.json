The LacI gene encodes for the Lac repressor protein, which is continuously expressed and binds to the operator region of the lac operon, preventing transcription of lac genes when lactose is absent. When lactose is present, it binds to the repressor, causing a conformational change that allows transcription of the lac genes. LacY and LacA are part of the Lac operon and encode for proteins involved in lactose transport and metabolism.
