The presence of a non-cystic cold nodule requires fine needle aspiration, and the high level of calcitonin suggests medullary thyroid carcinoma.

MEN1 gene mutations are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia, but not specifically with thyroid cancer. Loss of function of PPAR\u0263 is associated with insulin resistance and diabetes, and activating mutations of BRAF receptor are associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma."
