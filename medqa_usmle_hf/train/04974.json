Given the patient's history of childhood obesity, irregular menstrual cycles, and physical exam findings of acne and hirsutism, along with elevated testosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels, the most likely diagnosis is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Option C, deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, is a type of congenital adrenal hyperplasia that can present similarly to PCOS, but the elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone level would be much more significant than what is seen here. Therefore, option C is still the most likely diagnosis. Options A and B refer to other types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, while option D is not supported by the given information."
