The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and a long history of smoking, which are all risk factors for atherosclerosis. The chest pain that occurs after physical activity and resolves with rest suggests stable angina, which is commonly caused by fixed, atherosclerotic coronary stenosis (> 70%). Multivessel atherosclerotic disease with or without a nonocclusive thrombus can also cause stable angina, but it is less likely given the patient's presentation. Intermittent coronary vasospasm is more commonly associated with variant angina, and sudden disruption of an atheromatous plaque with a resulting occlusive thrombus is more commonly associated with unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction."

The risk factors for atherosclerosis include obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and smoking. The most likely etiology is fixed, atherosclerotic coronary stenosis (> 70%) as the chest pain resolves with rest, indicating insufficient blood supply to the heart muscle during exertion. Multivessel atherosclerotic disease with or without a nonocclusive thrombus and sudden disruption of an atheromatous plaque, with a resulting occlusive thrombus are more related to acute coronary syndromes such as unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction. Intermittent coronary vasospasm with or without coronary atherosclerosis is more related to Prinzmetal's angina."
