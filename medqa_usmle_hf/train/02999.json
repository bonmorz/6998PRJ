The patient has a normochromic anemia, ruled out blood loss as the cause of anemia, and has a decreased reticulocyte count, which points towards a normocytic anemia. This type of anemia is commonly seen in chronic kidney disease patients, as the kidneys are responsible for producing erythropoietin, which stimulates red blood cell production. Therefore, starting erythropoietin is a suitable treatment option. Macrocytic anemia can occur in vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, while microcytic anemia is seen in iron deficiency."

The patient has a normochromic anemia with a decreased reticulocyte count and no evidence of blood loss or microcytic anemia.

Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells and is indicated for patients with anemia secondary to renal failure. Normocytic anemia is typically seen in these patients. Macrocytic anemia with or without megaloblasts is usually caused by deficiencies in vitamin B12 or folic acid, which is not mentioned in this patient\u2019s history or lab results. Microcytic anemia is typically seen in iron deficiency anemia, but the patient\u2019s stool is negative for blood, making this unlikely."
