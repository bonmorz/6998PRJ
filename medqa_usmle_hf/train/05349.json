Among the options, only option B suggests a lung cancer producing a peptide with hormonal activity, which can cause hypercalcemia. Squamous cell carcinoma can produce parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), which can also cause hypercalcemia, but option B is a more likely possibility in this scenario because the radiograph suggests a centrally located mass, which is more characteristic of small cell carcinoma. Metastatic abdominal cancer is less likely given the radiograph finding."

Hypercalcemia is often seen in lung cancers that produce peptides with hormonal activity, such as squamous cell carcinoma or small cell carcinoma. Option A is incorrect because parathyroid hormone is not typically produced by squamous cell carcinomas. Option C is possible but less likely given the presentation of the patient, and Option D is incorrect because small cell carcinoma is more commonly associated with hypercalcemia caused by parathyroid hormone-related peptide. Therefore, the most likely explanation in this scenario is Option B, where the lung cancer is producing a non-parathyroid hormonal peptide that is causing the hypercalcemia."
