Selegiline is a selective MAO-B inhibitor that can be used to treat these symptoms. The patient also mentions symptoms of depression, which can be seen in Parkinson's disease, and can also be treated with selegiline. Other options such as benztropine and bromocriptine are used to treat extrapyramidal side effects and hyperprolactinemia, respectively. Levodopa/carbidopa is effective in treating Parkinson's disease but would not be the first-line medication in this case."
