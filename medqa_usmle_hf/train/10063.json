The infant\u2019s history, physical examination, and image show signs of physiologic neonatal acne and Mongolian spots, which are benign conditions. The erythema and swelling of the vulva and vagina with a blood-stained white discharge suggest the possibility of maternal hormone withdrawal, commonly referred to as pseudomenstruation, which is a common and self-limiting condition. Reassurance is the most appropriate next step in management. Antibiotics are not indicated as there is no evidence of infection. Leuprolide is a medication that inhibits hormone production and is not indicated for this condition. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication and is not indicated for this condition."

The father\u2019s concern about bruises suggests that he may be misinterpreting the normal Mongolian spots as bruises. Therefore, reassurance is the most appropriate next step in management. Antibiotics may be necessary if the infant is found to have a bacterial infection, but there is no evidence to suggest that in this case. Leuprolide and fluconazole do not have indications for newborns with these symptoms."

The infant\u2019s symptoms and history suggest that she may have transient neonatal pustular melanosis, which can present with flat gray-blue patches on the back and buttocks and mild acne. The erythema and swelling of the vulva and vagina with a blood-stained discharge are concerning for a bacterial infection, but given the infant\u2019s history of maternal gonococcal infection that was treated with antibiotics, it is unlikely that this is the cause. Therefore, reassurance is the most appropriate next step. The other options are not indicated. Ceftriaxone and doxycycline therapy is used to treat suspected or confirmed gonococcal infections. Leuprolide is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist used to treat conditions such as endometriosis or precocious puberty. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication often used to treat yeast infections."

The infant has evidence of a normal physiologic response to maternal hormone withdrawal, and the gray-blue patches suggest mongolian spots, which are benign.

Ceftriaxone and doxycycline therapy would be appropriate if there was evidence of systemic infection or sepsis. Leuprolide therapy is not indicated for this patient. Fluconazole therapy would be appropriate if there was evidence of a fungal infection, but there are no signs suggestive of such an infection."

The flat gray-blue patches on the back and buttocks are most likely Mongolian spots, which are also common in infants, particularly those of Asian or African descent. Given the history of maternal gonococcal infection, the vulvar erythema and swelling with a blood-stained discharge suggest possible infection. However, before initiating antibiotic therapy, it is important to obtain a culture and sensitivity of the discharge to confirm the diagnosis of infection and to guide appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to obtain a culture and sensitivity of the discharge and to provide reassurance to the father about the other findings. Options B, C, and D are not indicated at this time."
