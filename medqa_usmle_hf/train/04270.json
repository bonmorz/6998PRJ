The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a hypertensive emergency with possible cyanide toxicity from nitroprusside. Hydroxocobalamin is the specific antidote for nitroprusside toxicity and is the best treatment for this patient. Amyl nitrite is a short-acting vasodilator and would not treat the underlying issue. Insulin can be used in hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state but is not indicated here. Labetalol is already being used for blood pressure control."

Amyl nitrite is used for cyanide poisoning, insulin is used for hyperkalemia, and labetalol may be used in combination with nitroprusside to treat hypertensive crises, but Hydroxocobalamin is the best choice in this scenario."

The patient is presenting with symptoms of hypertensive emergency and his elevated blood pressure requires treatment with medication. However, the presentation of confusion, headache, and flushing after starting medication suggests the possibility of cyanide toxicity, as nitroprusside can release cyanide. Hydroxocobalamin is an antidote for cyanide toxicity and would be the best treatment option in this scenario. Amyl nitrite is used for cyanide poisoning, but not in this case because the patient is already on a nitroprusside drip. Insulin would be helpful for hyperglycemia, but it does not treat the hypertensive emergency. Labetalol is a commonly used medication for hypertensive emergencies, but it does not address the possibility of cyanide toxicity."
