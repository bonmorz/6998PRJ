The polypoid growths and linear ulcers seen on colonoscopy, along with the biopsy findings, confirm the suspicion of ulcerative colitis. Genetic studies are not necessary at this time as the diagnosis can be made based on clinical presentation and colonoscopy findings. Glutamate dehydrogenase antigen immunoassay is used to diagnose Clostridioides difficile infection, which is not the likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Annual colonoscopy is the appropriate recommendation for surveillance of patients with ulcerative colitis."
