Option (A) is incorrect because the atrial rate in atrial flutter is typically between 250-350 beats per minute.

Atrial flutter is characterized by a rapid, regular atrial rhythm at a rate of 250 to 400 beats per minute, which produces atrial rates above 400 beats per minute. However, option (A) is not correct because the question asks for the most likely ECG finding. The slurred upstroke of R wave is a characteristic of a delta wave seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and not in atrial flutter. No discernible P waves are seen in atrial fibrillation, not in atrial flutter. Option (C), atrioventricular block, is often seen in atrial flutter due to the fixed conduction ratio between atrial and ventricular activity. So, option (C) is the correct answer."

The description of atrial flutter with regular tachycardia and absence of extra heart sounds on physical examination is consistent with Type I atrial flutter. Type I flutter is caused by a reentrant circuit located in the right atrium that involves the cavotricuspid isthmus. The ECG will show sawtooth waves and a fixed, consistent ventricular response. The most likely finding on the ECG will be atrioventricular block. This is because the atrial rate is usually much higher than the ventricular rate in atrial flutter, and the AV node will block some atrial impulses from reaching the ventricles."
