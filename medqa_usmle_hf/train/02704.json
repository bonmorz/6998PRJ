Difficulty swallowing and a feeling of something in the back of the throat may be caused by a benign tumor of the thymus, which is common in patients with myasthenia gravis. The chest pain is likely caused by the enlarging tumor in the thymus pressing on the nerves or other organs. Superior vena cava syndrome would cause swelling of the face, neck, and arms due to compression of the superior vena cava, and it is not associated with difficulty swallowing. Anaplastic thyroid cancer and mediastinitis are also unlikely based on the absence of other accompanying symptoms."
