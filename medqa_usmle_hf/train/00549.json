The most appropriate next step is to start combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and schedule a cesarean delivery at 38 weeks' gestation to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Intrapartum zidovudine and vaginal delivery may be considered for women with low HIV loads, but in this case, the load is too high. Immediate cesarean delivery is not necessary as the patient is at 36 weeks' gestation and there is time to initiate cART before delivery."

The patient is HIV positive with a viral load of 11,000 copies/mL, which meets the criteria for combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) according to current guidelines. Cesarean delivery is recommended for women with HIV to prevent vertical transmission of the virus. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to start cART and schedule cesarean delivery at 38 weeks' gestation. Intrapartum zidovudine and vaginal delivery are options for women who have received adequate antepartum cART and have viral loads below the limit of detection, which is not the case for this patient. Conducting cesarean delivery immediately is not necessary and could pose risks to the mother and fetus."
