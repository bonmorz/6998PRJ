Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol upon exposure to UVB rays. However, the patient has been avoiding sunlight exposure, so she may not be getting enough Vitamin D from this process. Vitamin D obtained through the diet is either cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) from animal sources or ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) from plant sources. Both cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol require 25-hydroxylation in the liver to become active Vitamin D, but the most likely cause of the patient's deficiency is the lack of synthesis of cholecalciferol. Therefore, impairment of the synthesis of cholecalciferol is the most likely cause of the patient's x-ray findings."

The patient's history of being a vegetarian and avoiding sunlight exposure suggests that the most likely cause of her decreased bone density is a deficiency in vitamin D, specifically cholecalciferol. Synthesis of cholecalciferol occurs in the skin with UVB exposure, and a lack of sunlight exposure can lead to deficiency. 25-hydroxylation of cholecalciferol occurs in the liver and is necessary for activation of vitamin D in the kidneys, but the primary cause of the deficiency is the lack of cholecalciferol synthesis. Synthesis of 7-dehydrocholesterol is the precursor for vitamin D synthesis in the skin, and synthesis of ergocalciferol is a form of vitamin D that occurs naturally in some plant sources and can be used as a supplement.
