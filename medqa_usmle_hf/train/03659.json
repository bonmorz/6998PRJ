This is characteristic of acute thyroiditis, whereas the other options are characteristic of other thyroid conditions."

The cyst arises from remnants of the thyroglossal duct, which is a structure that connects the thyroid gland to the base of the tongue during embryonic development. It is lined by epithelial cells that resemble thyroid follicular cells and can become infected, resulting in tenderness and warmth. Histologic examination of the lesion would likely reveal follicular cells surrounding colloid and admixed with a neutrophilic infiltrate, consistent with a thyroglossal duct cyst. None of the other options are associated with this type of lesion."

Histologic examination of a thyroglossal duct cyst would reveal follicular cells surrounding colloid and admixed with a neutrophilic infiltrate, as in option (A). Option (B) describes papillary thyroid carcinoma, which would be unlikely in a child. Option (C) describes goiter, which would be diffuse rather than a discrete mass.
