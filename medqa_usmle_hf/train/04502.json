Phenelzine belongs to a class of drugs called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and has a potential to interact with certain foods and beverages that contain high levels of tyramine.

Option B is incorrect as there is no known interaction between Phenelzine and phenytoin, the patient\u2019s current medication. Option C is an incorrect distracter as sexual dysfunction is more commonly seen with SSRIs. Option D is also incorrect as Phenelzine is known to have a stimulatory effect and may worsen insomnia or sleep disturbances."
