The confusion after the episode confirms the diagnosis of absence seizures. EEG is used to detect and confirm the diagnosis of absence seizures and often shows generalized spikes and waves. Defiant behavior towards figures of authority and impairment in communication and social interaction are characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder.

The symptoms (daydreaming, lip smacking, confusion after the episode) suggest that the patient is experiencing absence seizures.

The patient had repeated episodes of \"daydreaming\" with lip smacking and confusion afterward, which suggest complex partial seizures.
