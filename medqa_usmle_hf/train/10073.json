The onset of chest pain during lying and relief of pain after a couple of minutes are typical of unstable angina or a heart attack. The elevated anterior ST-segment on ECG supports this diagnosis. Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, can be used to prevent further episodes of chest pain, as it reduces myocardial oxygen demand and increases coronary blood supply. Ramipril, an ACE inhibitor, and Clopidogrel, an antiplatelet agent, are commonly used as secondary prevention after a heart attack. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, can prevent further episodes of chest pain but is not the best option because it may mask symptoms of ongoing ischemia."
