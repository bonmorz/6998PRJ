The patient\u2019s symptoms of hoarseness and dysphagia in conjunction with his smoking history suggest the most likely cause is malignant proliferation of squamous cells, indicating esophageal cancer. Malignant proliferation of glandular tissue in the esophagus is more commonly associated with Barrett\u2019s esophagus, which is associated with acid reflux, and is not as likely given the patient\u2019s symptoms. Reduced lower esophageal pressure is associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease, which is not the most likely cause for this patient. Chronic autoimmune gastritis is associated with the stomach and is not consistent with the patient\u2019s symptoms."
