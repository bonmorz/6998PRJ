The symptoms and ophthalmologic examination suggest that the patient has age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading cause of central vision loss in elderly people. Ranibizumab is a commonly used treatment for neovascular AMD. It works by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is involved in the neovascularization process that leads to the subretinal fluid and hemorrhage in the macular area. Etanercept is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor that is used for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Thermal laser photocoagulation and macular translocation surgery are not recommended for neovascular AMD."
