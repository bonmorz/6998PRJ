This would cause increased blood flow from the LV to the RV, leading to increased oxygen tension in the RV and pulmonary circulation, and eventually increased oxygen tension in the SC. Therefore, the most likely oxygen tension profile would be LV: normal, RV: increased, SC: normal. Option A is incorrect because a decreased oxygen tension in the LV would suggest a different type of heart defect. Option C is incorrect because a decreased oxygen tension in the systemic circulation would be unlikely with a VSD. Option D is incorrect because all oxygen tensions are expected to be normal with a VSD."

The high-pitched, harsh, holosystolic murmur heard at the lower left sternal border is consistent with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Option B is the correct answer as it reflects the typical physiology for VSD, with increased oxygen tension in the right ventricle due to increased pulmonary blood flow and normal oxygen tension in the systemic circulation.

The high-pitched, harsh, holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the lower left sternal border indicates a ventricular septal defect (VSD). In VSD, there is an abnormal communication between the left and right ventricles, which increases the amount of blood flow from the left to the right ventricle. This leads to increased pulmonary flow and increased systemic circulation, which can result in increased oxygenation in the right heart but decreased oxygenation in the left heart and systemic circulation. Therefore, LV oxygen tension would be normal, RV oxygen tension would be increased, and SC oxygen tension would be normal. This corresponds to option (B)."
