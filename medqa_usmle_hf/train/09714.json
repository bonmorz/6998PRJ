The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest mania or hypomania, which can be caused by an SSRI, especially when used without a mood stabilizing agent. The mortality-lowering agent can be lithium or an antipsychotic drug. Testing thyroid and renal function is necessary, as these factors can affect the metabolism and clearance of the medications used for bipolar disorder. Clonazepam and valproic acid are possible treatments for bipolar disorder but are not the next best step in management in this case. Restarting the SSRI without a mood stabilizing agent would likely worsen the patient\u2019s symptoms."
