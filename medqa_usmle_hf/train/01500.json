The patient presents with symptoms of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. The abnormal skin and coolness of the left lower extremity suggest blood vessel blockage, which is also supported by the laboratory testing results that reveal high LDL and triglyceride levels. Treatment for PAD includes aspirin and a statin, but in severe cases or those that do not respond to this regimen, cilostazol may also be added. Therefore, the best option is aspirin and atorvastatin."

Option B, aspirin and atorvastatin, is the recommended medication regimen for this patient. Aspirin will help prevent clotting in the narrowed blood vessels, and atorvastatin will help lower cholesterol levels, which will slow the progression of the disease.
