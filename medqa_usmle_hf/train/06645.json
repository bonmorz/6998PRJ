The patient has a family history of Alzheimer disease, but her symptoms are also consistent with autoimmune thyroid disease, which can cause memory loss, fatigue, weight gain, and dry skin. The delayed achilles reflex suggests a neurologic issue, which could also be caused by thyroid disease. Thiamine deficiency can cause memory loss but is less likely given the patient's history of excessive alcohol use. Normal pressure hydrocephalus typically presents with gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia, which are not present in this case."

The history of excessive alcohol consumption, along with the symptoms and signs, suggests the most likely underlying etiology is autoimmune thyroid disease. Thiamine deficiency would cause specific symptoms such as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, while normal pressure hydrocephalus would have a different set of symptoms. Alzheimer disease is a possibility given the family history, but autoimmune thyroid disease is the most likely given the history of alcohol consumption and exam findings."

The patient has a family history of Alzheimer's disease, but the quick onset of symptoms at age 78 and the presence of delayed relaxation of the Achilles reflex suggest a neurological problem unrelated to Alzheimer's. The weight gain, dry skin, and brittle nails suggest an underactive thyroid, and the achiness and tiredness could be related to decreased metabolism. Autoimmune thyroid disease can cause memory loss and can be easily treated with thyroid hormone replacement therapy."

The patient's son's complaint of progressive memory loss and her family history of Alzheimer's disease make the reader consider Alzheimer's disease as a possibility. However, her delayed relaxation of the Achilles reflex and brittle nails suggest another diagnosis. Thiamine deficiency is associated with neurological symptoms including memory loss, but the brittle nails suggest another diagnosis. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is also associated with neurological symptoms including memory loss, but the brittle nails are not relevant to this diagnosis. Autoimmune thyroid disease is associated with memory loss, fatigue, and brittle nails, so this is the most likely underlying etiology."
