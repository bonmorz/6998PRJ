Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, which is responsible for keeping the ductus arteriosus open during fetal circulation. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis results in constriction of smooth muscle in the ductus arteriosus, leading to closure of the vessel. Therefore, option (B) could be a distractor. Decreased blood flow in the vasa vasorum of the ductus arteriosus, and not inhibition of lipoxygenase or increased synthesis of PDGF, is the mechanism responsible for successful closure of the ductus arteriosus."

Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used to close a patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants.
