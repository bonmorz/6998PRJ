Among the options, only Gilbert syndrome is a liver disorder characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and is associated with neonatal jaundice, fasting, infection, and/or dehydration. Ceftriaxone administration can cause biliary sludge leading to biliary obstruction and cholestasis but it is not likely in this case given the time frame. Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a rare genetic disorder with severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, whereas pancreatic cancer usually presents with obstructive jaundice, abdominal pain, and weight loss, which were not mentioned in this case."

Ceftriaxone administration would cause more acute symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. Pancreatic cancer is highly unlikely given the patient's young age and lack of other risk factors. Crigler-Najjar syndrome would cause more severe and persistent jaundice."

The symptoms suggest that the most likely cause is Gilbert syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of bilirubin.

Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that also affects bilirubin metabolism, but it presents at a much younger age and is associated with more severe symptoms.
