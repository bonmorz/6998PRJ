The patient has a history of recurrent infections, which suggests a possible primary immunodeficiency like common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) or selective IgA deficiency. In CVID, levels of all immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG, IgA) are usually low or normal but not elevated. In selective IgA deficiency, levels of IgA are low or absent while IgG and IgM are normal. Therefore, the most likely scenario is normal IgM and IgG levels with low IgA levels, which is seen in option C. The presence of gram-positive diplococci suggests a bacterial infection which would activate the patient\u2019s immune response leading to increased levels of immunoglobulins, ruling out option B."

IgM is the first antibody produced in the primary immune response and is usually elevated during an acute infection. In this case, the IgM level would be normal because the patient has had multiple infections before. IgG provides long-term immunity and is the most abundant immunoglobulin in the blood. A low level of IgG suggests an antibody deficiency. IgA is secreted by mucosal surfaces and helps prevent infections in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. A low level of IgA suggests an increased risk of recurrent infections in these areas. Therefore, option (C) is the best choice because the patient is likely to have a normal IgM level since she has had multiple infections before, and an IgG level and IgA level that are both low, indicating an antibody deficiency."
