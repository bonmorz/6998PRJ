The condition described in this question is placenta accreta, which is characterized by abnormal adherence of the placenta to the uterine wall. Risk factors for this condition include multiple previous cesarean deliveries, as well as other uterine surgeries. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. While genitourinary infections and antibiotic use in the first trimester can increase the risk for various complications during pregnancy, they are not specifically associated with placenta accreta. A history of amenorrhea also does not directly increase the risk for placenta accreta."
