Tilt-table test and Valsalva maneuver may also be useful in certain cases, but they are not the best initial step for this patient. Cardiac enzymes are not indicated in this case."

The patient's symptom of feeling a fluttering in his chest before collapsing suggests an arrhythmia as the cause of the syncope. The ECG shows an old bifascicular block, but the echocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitoring are normal. Therefore, a continuous loop recorder is the best next step to capture any possible arrhythmias that might have occurred when the patient felt the fluttering in his chest. The tilt-table test and Valsalva maneuver are used to diagnose vasovagal syncope, which is less likely given the patient's medical history. Cardiac enzymes are not necessary in this case as the ECG and echocardiogram are normal."

Continuous loop recorder is the best next step in the evaluation of this condition, as it can help detect arrhythmia even if it doesn't occur during the brief period of an ECG or Holter monitoring. Tilt-table test is used to evaluate causes of syncope, but it is less specific than continuous loop recorder. Valsalva maneuver is used to evaluate autonomic dysfunction, which is less likely to be the cause of this patient's symptoms. Cardiac enzymes are not indicated in this case as there is no indication of acute coronary syndrome."
