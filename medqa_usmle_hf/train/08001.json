X-linked recessive inheritance would also require both parents to be carriers but would not explain the patient's sensorineural deafness."

The presence of sensorineural deafness and hematuria suggest Alport syndrome, which is caused by mutations in genes that encode type IV collagen, a major component of the glomerular basement membrane. Alport syndrome is most commonly inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). Autosomal recessive inheritance and mitochondrial inheritance do not fit the pattern of inheritance for Alport syndrome, and X-linked recessive inheritance does not explain the fact that females can also be affected by the disease."
