The T cells in the cortex of the thymus are still in the process of differentiation and are not yet fully differentiated into Th1 or Th2 cells, so option (B) and (C) can be ruled out. The fact that they are undergoing positive and negative selection based on their ability to bind cortical epithelial cells expressing MHC molecules suggests that they are CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as both types of T cells undergo this process in the thymus. Option (D) is incorrect because it suggests that the T cells are only CD4+ and not CD8+."

During the early phases of thymic T cell differentiation, T cells express both CD4 and CD8 molecules, and are known as double-positive (DP) thymocytes. As they undergo positive and negative selection, some T cells will become single-positive CD4+ or CD8+ cells, whereas others will undergo apoptosis if they fail to interact with MHC molecules on cortical epithelial cells. Therefore, the T cells in this phase of differentiation would be CD4+ and CD8+."

The T cells isolated from the cortex of the thymus are in the process of positive selection, during which T cells that do not bind cortical epithelial cells expressing MHC molecules die by apoptosis. This process will result in the selection of T cells that are capable of recognizing MHC molecules, leading to CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lineages. Therefore, the correct answer is (A). Th2 is a subset of T helper cells that produce cytokines to help in the defense against extracellular parasites. T cell precursor refers to immature T cells that have not undergone the process of positive and negative selection in the thymus. CD4+ refers to T helper cells that recognize MHC class II molecules."
