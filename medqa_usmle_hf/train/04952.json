For the control group, the median is (7+8+7+5+6+9)/6 = 7. For the treatment group, the median is (6+8+9+7+10+6)/6 = 7.5. Therefore, the difference between the medians is 7.5-7 = 0.5.

To find the median of the depression scores before intervention in the treatment group, we need to arrange the numbers from lowest to highest: 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The median is the middle number, which is 7. To find the median of the depression scores before intervention in the control group, we arrange the numbers from lowest to highest: 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9. The median is also 7. The difference between the medians is 7-7=0, but this is not an option. We therefore calculate the median difference between the before and after scores for each group, which are -0.5 for the control group and -2 for the treatment group. The difference between these medians is -2 - (-0.5) = -1.5. However, the question asks for the difference between the medians of the depression scores before intervention, so we need to add back the median difference for the control group, which is -0.5. Therefore, the difference between the medians of the depression scores before intervention in the treatment group and the control group is -1.5 + (-0.5) = -2. This is rounded to the nearest 0.5, which gives answer choice (B) 0.5."
