Since Compound X undergoes net secretion in the renal tubules, its renal clearance is greater than its inulin clearance (which represents glomerular filtration rate). Therefore, we can estimate the renal clearance of Compound X by subtracting the inulin clearance from the PAH clearance: 600 - 120 = 480 mL/min. The total tubular secretion of Compound X is given as 60 mg/min, so its renal clearance is 60/480 = 0.125 mg/mL. Since the net renal excretion of Compound X is given as 300 mg/min, this corresponds to a plasma concentration of 300/0.125 = 2400 mg/mL. However, this is not an answer choice.
