The symptoms and physical examination findings suggest neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) with optic glioma and precocious puberty. The multifocal lytic calvarial lesions suggest the diagnosis of Jaffe-Lichtenstein syndrome (JLS), a rare manifestation of NF-1. The biopsy findings of JLS typically show numerous small, dispersed fibroblasts, and histiocytes with intervening collagen bundles. The collagen bundles have a \u201cmoth-eaten\u201d appearance with rod-shaped granules and a latticed matrix. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) - Rod-shaped granules with a latticed matrix."
