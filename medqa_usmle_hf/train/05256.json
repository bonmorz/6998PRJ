The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest rheumatoid arthritis (RA) which is commonly associated with hand pain and swelling. The presence of a mild systolic murmur suggests that the patient may have mitral stenosis, which is a common complication of long-standing RA. The yellow-white plaques beneath the nail beds are likely to be subungual nodules, another manifestation of RA. Administering indomethacin alone is not sufficient for the management of RA. Methotrexate is commonly used in the treatment of RA and is often initiated together with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as indomethacin."

The symptoms of joint pain and swelling, as well as the presence of nail bed plaques suggest a possible diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can help relieve symptoms, but should not be used as the sole treatment. Methotrexate is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) that can help slow the progression of psoriatic arthritis. Sulfasalazine is another DMARD that can be used in combination with methotrexate.
