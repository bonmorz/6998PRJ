The anemia is likely due to the inhibition of ALA dehydratase and ferrochelatase by lead. Chronic loss of blood through the GI tract would result in a normocytic anemia, and X-linked mutation of ALA synthetase is a rare genetic disorder. Inflammation due to an occult malignancy would result in normocytic, normochromic anemia with high levels of ferritin due to inflammation."

Chronic loss of blood through GI tract and X-linked mutation of ALA synthetase are not associated with lead poisoning.
