In COPD, the airways are partially obstructed, leading to increased residual volume and total lung capacity. Therefore, the most likely PFT result would be increased residual volume and total lung capacity. Option B is incorrect because in COPD, residual volume is increased, not decreased. Option C is incorrect because in COPD, both residual volume and total lung capacity are not normal. Option D is incorrect because in COPD, residual volume is increased even if total lung capacity is decreased."
