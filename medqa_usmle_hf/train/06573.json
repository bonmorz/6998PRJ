Propranolol is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy option because it is a beta-blocker that can help reduce heart rate and blood pressure, which can help with anxiety symptoms and sweating. Olanzapine is an antipsychotic and is not appropriate for this patient's symptoms. Venlafaxine and sertraline are both antidepressants and may not be the best first-line treatment for this patient's anxiety symptoms."

The patient is experiencing anxiety related to work, especially during oral presentations which leads to axillary sweating and embarrassment. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as heart racing and sweating. It is commonly used for performance anxiety and can be taken as needed or regularly. Olanzapine is an antipsychotic medication used mainly for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Venlafaxine is an antidepressant medication used for major depressive disorder and anxiety. Sertraline is another antidepressant medication used for major depressive disorder, anxiety, and other conditions. None of these options are specifically targeted towards the patient's symptoms of performance anxiety. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is Propranolol."
