The scatter plot on the left shows a positive correlation between median income and matching difficulty, meaning that specialties with higher median incomes tend to be more difficult to match into. The scatter plot on the right shows a positive correlation between weekly work hours and matching difficulty, meaning that specialties with longer weekly work hours tend to be more difficult to match into. However, the correlation between median income and matching difficulty appears to be stronger than the correlation between weekly work hours and matching difficulty, as the scatter plot on the left is more tightly clustered than the one on the right. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) median income has a stronger correlation with matching difficulty than weekly work hours."

The graph shows that specialties with higher median incomes tend to be easier to match into, while specialties with longer work hours tend to be harder to match into. Therefore, the statement that best describes the results is (C) Median income has a stronger correlation with matching difficulty than weekly work hours. This means that medical students tend to prioritize higher earning specialties, even if they are more difficult to match into."

The y-axis represents the difficulty of matching into a specialty, and the x-axis represents either median income or weekly work hours. Plot A shows a weak positive correlation between difficulty of matching and median income, while plot B shows a stronger positive correlation between difficulty of matching and weekly work hours. Therefore, option (C) is the correct statement, as median income has a stronger correlation with matching difficulty than weekly work hours. Option (A) is incorrect, as there is a weak correlation between difficulty of matching and weekly work hours in plot A. Option (B) is incorrect, as plot A shows a weaker correlation between matching difficulty and weekly work hours. Option (D) is incorrect, as there is no clear relationship between median income and weekly work hours in these plots."

The x-axis represents median income, the y-axis represents weekly work hours, and the size of the data point represents the difficulty of matching into that specialty. Looking at the plots, we can see that for each income level there are specialties with different levels of matching difficulty. However, as we move along the y-axis, the difficulty of matching into specialties generally increases. This suggests that weekly work hours have a stronger correlation with matching difficulty than median income. Therefore, option (B) is incorrect. Looking at the size of the data points, we can also see that there are more specialties with high matching difficulty as weekly work hours increase. This further supports the idea that weekly work hours have a stronger correlation with matching difficulty than median income. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect. Finally, option (D) can be eliminated because there is no clear relationship between median income and weekly work hours; some specialties with high median incomes have longer work hours and some have shorter work hours. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) - median income has a stronger correlation with matching difficulty than weekly work hours."

Based on the scatter plots, it appears that there is a stronger correlation between the difficulty of matching into a specialty and median income compared to weekly work hours. Option (C) correctly describes this finding. Option (A) is incorrect because there is no clear relationship between the difficulty of matching and weekly work hours - some specialties with high difficulty have high weekly work hours while others have low weekly work hours. Option (B) is also incorrect because, while there is a statistically significant association between weekly work hours and matching difficulty, it is not as strong as the association between median income and matching difficulty. Lastly, option (D) is incorrect because there is no clear relationship between median income and weekly work hours - some specialties with high median income have high weekly work hours while others have low weekly work hours."

The data points indicate that there is a positive correlation between median income and matching difficulty, meaning that specialties with higher median incomes tend to be more competitive to match into. There is also a positive correlation between weekly work hours and matching difficulty, with specialties that require longer work hours being more competitive to match into. However, the correlation between median income and matching difficulty appears to be stronger, as the data points on the right plot are more tightly clustered along the trend line, compared to those on the left plot.
