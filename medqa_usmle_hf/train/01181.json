Choice (B) is also unlikely as hyperkalemia is not a typical symptom of botulism. Choice (D) is not related to the pathogenesis of botulism, but rather myasthenia gravis. Therefore, (C) is the correct option as it is related to the growth of Clostridium botulinum in the patient's colon, leading to the production of botulinum toxin which causes the symptoms."
