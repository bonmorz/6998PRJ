The next best step in management would be to perform a heterophile agglutination test (monospot test), which is a screening test for infectious mononucleosis. Anti-CMV IgM and ELISA for HIV are not relevant in this case. Flow cytometry may be helpful in the diagnosis of certain hematological disorders, but it is not applicable in this case."
