The sudden loss of vision, severe posterior headache, and inability to recognize someone suggest that this is a posterior cerebral artery stroke, which is known to cause visual disturbances and can be accompanied by headache. The noncontrast CT scan ruled out hemorrhagic stroke, and the absence of other symptoms such as weakness or numbness makes middle cerebral and vertebrobasilar strokes less likely. Subarachnoid hemorrhage can cause a sudden headache but is not typically associated with visual disturbances."
