The first step is to warm the patient and treat his hypothermia, which can be achieved with warmed IV normal saline and warm blankets. Haloperidol may be used for agitation, but it can lower the seizure threshold, which can be a risk for hypothermic patients. Discontinuing steroids is not necessary in this case, and warm air recirculator alone is unlikely to be effective in treating hypothermia."

The patient is exhibiting symptoms of hypothermia, likely due to his lack of clothing and exposure to cold temperatures. The next best step would be to provide warming measures such as warmed IV normal saline and warm blankets before addressing any other medical issues. Haloperidol is a potential treatment option for the patient's agitation, but should only be considered once he has been stabilized medically. Discontinuing steroids may be helpful if the patient's symptoms are related to steroid-induced psychosis, but this cannot be confirmed without further evaluation. A warm air recirculator may be helpful in some cases of hypothermia, but is not as immediate or effective as warmed IV fluids and blankets."
