The CSF analysis shows a cloudy appearance, high opening pressure, high WBC count with predominantly PMN cells, low glucose level, and high protein level, which is indicative of bacterial meningitis. Gram stain also shows gram-negative diplococci, which is consistent with Neisseria meningitidis. Therefore, the appropriate treatment would be intravenous ceftriaxone. Rifampin is used for prophylaxis in close contacts, Acyclovir is used for viral infections such as herpes simplex virus, and Dexamethasone is used for reducing inflammation but can only be given after culture results are obtained."

The cloudy appearance and elevated opening pressure of CSF, along with the presence of gram-negative diplococci suggests a diagnosis of meningitis, most likely caused by Neisseria meningitidis.

Acyclovir is for the treatment of viral infections, while this is a bacterial infection. Dexamethasone is not used to treat the infection itself, but rather to reduce inflammation in patients with meningitis."
