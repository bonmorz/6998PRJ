The patient's symptoms and asymmetric corneal light reflection suggest esotropia, which requires a detailed eye exam to assess the degree of deviation, refractive error, and need for glasses. A cycloplegic agent like Cyclopentolate eye drops may be used to completely paralyze the ciliary muscle and dilate the pupil, enabling a more accurate assessment of the degree of deviation. Urgent surgery is not recommended unless the deviation is severe, the patient is not responding to medical management, or there is a risk of amblyopia. Patching of the right eye is not recommended unless there is amblyopia or suppression. Measurement of intraocular pressure is not necessary in this case."

Urgent surgery may be needed in some cases, but a cycloplegic refraction is the first step. Measurement of intraocular pressure is not indicated in this case."

The patient's symptoms and asymmetric corneal light reflection suggest infantile esotropia. Urgent surgery is not the first-line treatment and is reserved for cases of acute onset or high angle esotropia. Patching of the right eye is also not recommended as it can worsen the deviation in the long term. Measurement of intraocular pressure is not indicated in this case. The most appropriate next step would be to perform cycloplegic refraction using cyclopentolate eye drops on the left eye to determine if there is any refractive error contributing to the deviation. If there is no significant refractive error, then further management options such as strabismus surgery or vision therapy can be considered."
