The patient\u2019s symptoms, including purulent sputum, fever, chills, altered mental status, and multiple red spots suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The low platelet count, and elevated prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times are indicative of DIC. Ecchymoses are a characteristic feature of DIC. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura are not associated with purulent sputum and fever, which makes them unlikely options. Severe hepatic dysfunction may cause bleeding but is not supported by other findings in this patient."

The patient's symptoms suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a serious and often fatal bleeding and thrombotic disorder. The low platelet count, prolonged clotting times, elevated D-dimer concentrations, and the presence of ecchymoses throughout the body are consistent with DIC. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura causes thrombocytopenia, but not the other symptoms of DIC. Severe hepatic dysfunction can cause coagulopathy and bleeding, but not the thrombotic component. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura can cause thrombocytopenia and microvascular thrombi, but the presentation with ecchymoses is less common than in DIC."

The patient presents with a history of productive cough with purulent sputum and fever with chills, which suggests pneumonia. The development of bloody vomiting, altered mental status, and multiple red spots all over the body may point towards sepsis. The platelet count of 45,000/mm3, with a prolonged prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC is a condition characterized by the widespread activation of coagulation throughout the body, leading to both thrombosis and bleeding. The ecchymoses on both lower extremities could be due to the bleeding tendency in DIC."

The symptoms suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a pathological activation of coagulation that results in thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. The ecchymoses and abnormal bleeding parameters in the laboratory studies further support DIC as the cause of the patient's symptoms. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a condition that causes low platelet count, but it typically does not cause abnormal blood clotting. Severe hepatic dysfunction may cause abnormal blood clotting, but it is not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare blood disorder with similar symptoms to DIC, but it is caused by a deficiency of a specific enzyme and is not likely in this case."
