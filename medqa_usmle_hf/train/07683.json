Zinc supplementation is not indicated for this type of issue. Discontinuing steroids before surgery or rapidly tapering after 3 days may trigger adrenal insufficiency."

Hydrocortisone can provide similar anti-inflammatory effects but has a shorter half-life and therefore a lower likelihood of affecting wound healing. Adding zinc supplementation will not have a significant impact on wound healing. Discontinuing steroids before surgery can cause a flare-up of rheumatoid arthritis. Increasing the prednisone dose initially and tapering rapidly after 3 days can also increase the risk of wound failure."
