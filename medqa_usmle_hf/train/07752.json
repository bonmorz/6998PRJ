The positively birefringent rods and rhomboid crystals in the synovial fluid under polarized light indicate calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD), also known as pseudogout.

Thickening of the synovia at the metacarpophalangeal joints suggests rheumatoid arthritis, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation. Elevation of serum uric acid concentration is not typical for CPPD, but is seen in gout.
