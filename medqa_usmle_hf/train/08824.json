The CT scan shows an aortic aneurysm with extensive mural thrombus and periaortic hematoma, which is consistent with cystic medial degeneration.

Protozoal infections and autoimmune valve damage are less likely to cause an aortic aneurysm, and congenital aortic narrowing would present with symptoms much earlier in life."
