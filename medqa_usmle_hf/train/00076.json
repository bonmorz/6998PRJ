The presentation of the vesicular rash with painful, flaccid blisters that separate easily with gentle rubbing is characteristic of pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune disorder in which autoantibodies attack desmogleins, a type of cadherin protein found in desmosomes. This disruption in cadherin function causes the separation of skin cells, leading to blister formation."
