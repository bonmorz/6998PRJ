The symptoms of malaise, dyspnea, and yellow skin and sclera suggest hyperbilirubinemia, which is caused by increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin, and an increased number of reticulocytes in the peripheral blood suggests hemolysis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is hemolytic anemia. Acute leukemia is associated with abnormal white blood cells, sideropenic anemia with low levels of iron, and aplastic anemia with bone marrow failure."
