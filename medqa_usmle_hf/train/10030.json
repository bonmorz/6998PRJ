The patient\u2019s behavior of placing the thermometer in hot tea before taking her own temperature suggests that she may be intentionally contaminating the wound site, leading to recurrent infections and poor wound healing. This behavior is consistent with a condition known as factitious disorder imposed on self or Munchausen syndrome. Colonization with MRSA can cause recurrent infections, but there is no evidence to suggest this is the case. Vitamin C deficiency can lead to poor wound healing, but it is unlikely in a patient with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.5%. Recurrent infections due to an immune deficiency syndrome would be an unlikely explanation for this patient\u2019s symptoms."
