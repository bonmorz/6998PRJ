The specific disease is not mentioned, but the fact that it is caused by a missense mutation suggests a genetic disorder. The uncle's illness and the patient's worsening vision suggest that it is probably an autosomal dominant trait. The fact that the patient's wife and son have normal vision suggests that the wife is not affected and that the patient is heterozygous. Therefore, the probability that the son will inherit the disease is 50%, but the probability that he will be affected is only 25%. However, since the correct answer choice is not listed, the closest answer is 0%."
