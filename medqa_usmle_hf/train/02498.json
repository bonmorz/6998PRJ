The enzyme deficiency in question is tyrosinase, which plays a key role in melanin synthesis. The substrate that should be incubated with the hair bulb assay to determine the activity of this enzyme is dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), which is a precursor to melanin pigment. Option (B) Dopamine is a neurotransmitter and does not play a direct role in melanin synthesis. Option (C) Homogentisic acid is associated with a genetic disorder called alkaptonuria, which affects the metabolism of phenylalanine and tyrosine. Option (D) Tetrahydrobiopterin is a co-factor required for the synthesis of various neurotransmitters and other compounds, but is not directly involved in melanin synthesis."
