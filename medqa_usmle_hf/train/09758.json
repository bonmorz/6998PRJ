The caudate and putamen are involved in the pathology of Huntington\u2019s disease, so choice A is the correct answer. Depigmentation of the substantia nigra pars compacta is associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease, atrophy of the subthalamic nucleus is associated with Wilson\u2019s disease, and lesions in the vermis are associated with cerebellar ataxia, none of which are mentioned in the case."
