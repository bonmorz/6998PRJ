Inulin is a substance that is freely filtered and neither reabsorbed nor secreted, making it a more accurate measure of GFR than creatinine clearance. Creatinine is freely filtered but a small amount is actively secreted into the tubules, resulting in an overestimation of GFR when using its clearance as a measure. Therefore, the difference in the measurements is likely due to the active secretion of creatinine."

Inulin and creatinine are both freely filtered, but creatinine is actively secreted by the tubules while inulin is not.

Inulin is a substance that is not secreted, absorbed, or metabolized by the kidneys, making it an ideal marker for GFR. Creatinine, on the other hand, is actively secreted by the renal tubules, leading to an overestimation of GFR based on creatinine clearance. Therefore, the best explanation for the difference in these measurements is that creatinine is actively secreted, leading to an overestimation of GFR based on creatinine clearance."
