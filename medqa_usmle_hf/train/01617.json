The nerve passing through the parotid gland is the Facial nerve (CN VII), and injury to this nerve can result in changes in hearing, among other symptoms. Loss of taste from the posterior 1/3 of the tongue is a consequence of Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) injury. Loss of general sensation in the anterior 2/3 of the tongue is a consequence of Lingual nerve injury, which is a branch of the Mandibular division of the Trigeminal nerve (CN V3). Paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle is a consequence of Abducens nerve (CN VI) injury."

The nerve responsible for hearing is the vestibulocochlear nerve, which does not pass through the parotid gland. Therefore, the correct answer is D, changes in hearing, which can be caused by injury to the facial nerve in the parotid gland region due to its proximity to the inner ear."

The nerve that passes through the parotid gland is the facial nerve, which is responsible for innervating the muscles of facial expression and some glands in the head and neck region. Damage to this nerve can result in facial palsy or weakness, but it does not directly influence taste or general sensation of the tongue, or the lateral rectus muscle. However, the nerve also has a branch called the chorda tympani, which carries taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and passes through the middle ear. Consequently, injury to the facial nerve can lead to changes in taste, and also affect the hearing due to the proximity of the chorda tympani to the middle ear structures. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) changes in hearing."
