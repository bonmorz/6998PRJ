In a pleural effusion due to infection or malignancy, the glucose level in the pleural fluid is typically low. Thus, the most likely finding among the options is a glucose level of 30 mg/dL. Amylase elevation would suggest pancreatitis, lymphocytosis would suggest tuberculosis, and a low pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio would suggest a transudative effusion rather than exudative."

The x-ray shows loculated pleural effusion and consolidation of the surrounding lung. A decreased glucose level (< 60 mg/dL) in the pleural fluid is suggestive of an exudative effusion, which is the case in this patient. Option (B) is incorrect because lymphocytosis is usually never more than 50% in malignant effusions. Option (A) is incorrect because amylase is generally normal in pleural effusions. Option (C) is incorrect because a ratio of < 0.6 suggests exudate, but it is not specific to any particular diagnosis."

Amylase level elevation is more consistent with a pancreatic leak. Lymphocytosis is usually seen in tuberculosis and other chronic infections.
