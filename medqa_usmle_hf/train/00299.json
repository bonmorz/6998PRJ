The symptoms suggest reactive arthritis, which can occur after a bacterial infection such as chlamydia or gastroenteritis.

Lyme arthritis is a possibility because of the recent ankle joint involvement, but there is no history of tick bite or erythema migrans rash. Syphilitic arthritis is rare in this age group and the sexual history does not suggest it."

Lyme arthritis would have a history of tick bite, erythema migrans rash, and positive serologic testing for Borrelia burgdorferi. Syphilitic arthritis is a rare complication of untreated syphilis, which is unlikely in this case given the negative HIV test result."
