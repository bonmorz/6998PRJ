Dilated veins in the esophageal submucosa are seen in esophageal varices, but the patient does not have risk factors for it. Rupture of the distal esophagus and friable mass in the distal esophagus are consistent with Boerhaave syndrome and esophageal cancer, respectively, but these are less likely given the patient's history and presentation."

The patient presents with chest and epigastric pain after vomiting, forceful bloody emesis, dental enamel erosion, and calluses indicating bulimia nervosa, a condition where patients induce vomiting. Among the given options, mucosal lacerations at the gastroesophageal junction, also known as Mallory-Weiss syndrome, is the most likely finding due to the repeated vomiting. Dilated veins in the esophageal submucosa, or varices, are seen in patients with chronic liver disease. Rupture of the distal esophagus or Boerhaave syndrome is a medical emergency but is not associated with bulimia nervosa. A friable mass in the distal esophagus suggests malignancy, which is unlikely in a 22-year-old patient with a recent onset of symptoms."
