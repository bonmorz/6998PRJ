The presence of cervical lymphadenopathy and red, swollen hands and feet reinforces this diagnosis. Echocardiography is the most appropriate next step in management to evaluate for potential coronary artery involvement, which is a serious complication of Kawasaki disease. ANA measurement and antistreptolysin O titer measurement are not relevant to this diagnosis. HHV-6 IgM detection is also unlikely to provide diagnostic information for Kawasaki disease."
