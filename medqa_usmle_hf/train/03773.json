The pain is in the front of the knee, increases with activities like climbing stairs, and is reproduced by applying direct pressure to the right patella. Increased patellar laxity is also common in this syndrome. Iliotibial Band Syndrome also causes pain in the lateral side of the knee, but there is no mention of that in the case. Prepatellar bursitis causes swelling and pain anterior to the kneecap, which is not reported in this case. Osgood-Schlatter's disease mainly affects adolescents and is characterized by pain and swelling below the kneecap."

The pain is located at the front of the knee and increases with prolonged sitting and climbing stairs, which are classic symptoms of patellofemoral pain syndrome. The direct pressure on the patella and increased patellar laxity with medial and lateral displacement support this diagnosis. Iliotibial band syndrome would have pain on the outside of the knee, prepatellar bursitis would have tenderness over the patella and swelling, and Osgood-Schlatter's disease would have pain at the insertion of the patellar tendon."
