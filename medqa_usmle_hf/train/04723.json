The urethral opening on the dorsal aspect of the penis suggests that there was malpositioning of the genital tubercle during fetal development. The defect in the midline abdominal wall superior to the pubic symphysis with exposure of moist, erythematous mucosa suggests an omphalocele, which can also be associated with malpositioning of the genital tubercle. Persistence of the urogenital membrane would result in hypospadias, while abnormal development of the gubernaculum would result in cryptorchidism. Failed fusion of the urethral folds would result in epispadias."
