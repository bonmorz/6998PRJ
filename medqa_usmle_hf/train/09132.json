Breastmilk alone provides adequate nutrition for infants up to 6 months old, so supplementation with formula or cow\u2019s milk is not necessary. However, breastmilk is low in iron and vitamin D, and the patient\u2019s mild conjunctival pallor suggests possible iron deficiency anemia. Therefore, supplementation with iron and vitamin D is appropriate. Pureed foods should not be introduced until the infant is around 6 months old."

Breastmilk or formula is generally considered the only necessary food for infants up to 6 months old. Since this patient is exclusively breastfed and gaining weight appropriately, there is likely no immediate need to supplement his diet with formula. However, since the he is showing mild conjunctival pallor, which may be a sign of iron deficiency anemia, it would be appropriate to supplement his diet with iron and vitamin D. Adding cow's milk or pureed foods before the infant is ready can actually be harmful and should be avoided."

Supplementing the diet with formula may not be necessary if the infant is meeting their nutritional needs through breast milk, and it may also undermine the mother\u2019s confidence in breastfeeding."
