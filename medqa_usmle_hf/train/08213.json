Chronic bronchitis leads to an increase in the number and activity of goblet cells in the lungs, so (C) is the correct answer. Interstitial fibrosis of the lung is a feature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which is not associated with smoking. Pleural plaques are a feature of asbestos exposure. Ferruginous bodies are also a feature of asbestos exposure and not related to smoking."
