CK-MB is a marker of myocardial damage and is typically released 4-6 hours after the onset of chest pain, peaking at 24 hours. Recurrent chest pain 56 hours post-angioplasty suggests ongoing myocardial damage, which can be supported by elevated levels of CK-MB. Troponin I is another biomarker of myocardial damage, but it remains elevated for a longer period of time, making it less useful for diagnosing ongoing damage in this scenario. LDH and CK-MM are not specific markers for myocardial damage."
