The vomit appears grossly bloody, suggesting a mucosal tear at the gastroesophageal junction. This is also known as Mallory-Weiss syndrome and is seen in patients with a history of alcoholism, vomiting, and retching. Transmural distal esophagus tear and transmural erosion of the gastric wall are less likely because the vomiting started after the patient was already in the emergency department rather than during the retching phase. Gastric mucosal erosion is also less likely as it usually presents with chronic anemia rather than acute blood loss."
