The decreased sensation, weakness in hip flexion and knee extension, and decreased patellar reflex on the left indicate femoral nerve injury. The surgical incision is without erythema or drainage, ruling out surgical site infection. Sural nerve injury and femoral artery occlusion are less likely causes of these symptoms."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a nerve injury, and among the options, femoral nerve injury is the most likely cause as it innervates the anterior thigh muscles and the skin of the anterior and medial thigh, which is where the symptoms are located. The decreased patellar reflex also supports this hypothesis. The absence of erythema or drainage near the surgical incision makes surgical site infection unlikely. Sural nerve injury is unlikely as it innervates the skin of the lateral foot and ankle. Femoral artery occlusion is unlikely as there are normal pulses in the affected leg."

The decreased strength on hip flexion and knee extension, and decreased patellar reflex, all suggest involvement of the femoral nerve. Surgical site infection would likely be accompanied by erythema and/or drainage at the surgical incision site, which is not present in this case. Sural nerve injury would only involve sensation on the lower leg and not the thigh. Femoral artery occlusion would result in decreased or absent pulses and ischemic symptoms."

The prickling sensation and decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch on the anteromedial left thigh as well as medial lower leg are consistent with femoral nerve injury, and the decreased reflex on the left supports this diagnosis. The surgical site appears to be without infection, ruling out option (B). There is no evidence of vascular compromise to suggest femoral artery occlusion, making option (D) less likely. Sural nerve injury is also a possibility, but the symptoms are more consistent with femoral nerve injury."
