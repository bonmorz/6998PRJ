The symptoms and laboratory results suggest that the patient is most likely to experience a transient infection. Asymptomatic carrier state can occur in chronic infection, hepatocellular carcinoma is a complication that can occur in chronic infections, and fulminant hepatitis is a rare and severe complication that is not likely in this case."

Asymptomatic carrier state may occur in chronic hepatitis B infection, but the patient does not have hepatitis B surface antibody suggestive of past infection, nor hepatitis B core antibody suggestive of chronic infection."

The fact that she is positive for hepatitis B surface antigen but negative for hepatitis B surface antibody and anti-hepatitis B core antibody indicates that she is in the acute phase of hepatitis B infection, and her body has not yet produced any antibodies. The majority of patients with acute hepatitis recover completely with no long-term consequences, so the most likely outcome is a transient infection. Fulminant hepatitis is a possibility but is less likely in a young patient with no underlying liver disease. Asymptomatic carrier state and hepatocellular carcinoma are long-term outcomes and are not relevant to the acute phase of the infection."

Therefore, the most likely outcome is a transient infection that will resolve on its own."
