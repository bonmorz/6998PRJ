The positive dihydrorhodamine test indicates a defect in the NADPH oxidase pathway, which is involved in respiratory burst activity in phagocytes. The diminished myeloperoxidase staining also suggests a primary immunodeficiency. Option A is incorrect as phagocytes are unable to generate an oxidative burst to kill intracellular bacteria in chronic granulomatous disease, which is not the suspected condition here. Option C is not a recommended treatment for primary immunodeficiencies. Option D is not entirely accurate as the patient is specifically susceptible to fungal infections such as candidiasis, not all mycotic infections."
