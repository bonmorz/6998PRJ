The injury mechanism, antalgic gait, and backward translation of the foreleg suggest a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury. The PCL prevents backward translation of the tibia on the femur. An anterior cruciate ligament injury would result in instability in all directions. A lateral collateral ligament injury would not cause posterior instability, and a lateral meniscus injury would not cause backward translation of the tibia."

The PCL prevents the tibia from moving backwards in relation to the femur and its injury can cause posterior sag of the tibia. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is typically injured when the knee is rotated or twisted, while the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) is injured when there is a force on the inside of the knee. The lateral meniscus is often injured with twisting movements and would not cause posterior sag of the tibia."

The patient\u2019s presentation suggests posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury, which is often caused by a direct blow to the flexed knee or a fall onto a bent knee. The backward translation of the foreleg during the examination is a key feature of PCL injury. Anterior cruciate ligament injury would result in a positive Lachman test or pivot shift test, while lateral collateral ligament injury would result in instability on varus stress testing. Lateral meniscus injury would likely present with pain on lateral joint line palpation and a positive McMurray test."

The history of a fall on a flexed knee, pain and swelling that worsened over 2 days, and limited flexion by pain are all suggestive of a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury. The posterior drawer test result of 8 mm of backward translation of the foreleg also suggests a PCL injury, as the test is used to assess the integrity of the PCL. The other options are less likely based on the history and examination findings."
