The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest Turner syndrome, which is associated with a webbed neck, excess skin folds, low-set ears, and an increased carrying angle. Inferior rib notching is seen in patients with coarctation of the aorta, which is commonly found in Turner syndrome. Streak ovaries are also common findings in Turner syndrome, and therefore pelvic ultrasound would be the most likely additional finding. Options A and C are associated with Marfan syndrome, while option B is associated with coagulation disorders."
