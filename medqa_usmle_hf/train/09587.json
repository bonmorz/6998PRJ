The patient has focal back pain that is worsened with moving and lifting and relieved with rest and ibuprofen, which suggests a muscle strain. The history of IV drug use puts the patient at risk for spinal infection, but the lack of fever and normal C-reactive protein make epidural abscess or hematoma less likely. A compression fracture would be more likely if there was midline tenderness on exam."

The focal pain on one side of the spine, relief with rest and ibuprofen, and lack of midline tenderness are all consistent with muscle strain. Compression fracture would typically have midline tenderness and may not be related to lifting a heavy box. Epidural abscess and hematoma are both rare causes of back pain and would typically have more systemic symptoms and neurological deficits."
