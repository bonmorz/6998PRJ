The most appropriate step is to insert a copper-containing intrauterine device (IUD) within 5 days of unprotected sex. The IUD is effective in preventing pregnancy and can be left in place for long-term contraception. Ulipristal acetate and combined oral contraceptives can also be used as emergency contraception, but they are less effective than the IUD. Inserting a progestin-containing IUD could provide long-term contraception, but it is not as effective as the copper-containing IUD for emergency contraception. Keeping the patient's confidentiality is important and is a part of basic patient rights."
