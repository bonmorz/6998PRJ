Organophosphate poisoning can cause miosis (pinpoint pupils) and salivation, vomiting, and lacrimation (tearing) due to overstimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system. The antidote for organophosphate poisoning is atropine, which blocks the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. However, atropine can cause fast heart rate, dry mouth, and acute closed-angle glaucoma. Therefore, careful monitoring for signs of glaucoma is necessary."
