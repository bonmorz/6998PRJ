The intermittent headaches, family history, and fainting episode suggest the patient may have familial hyperaldosteronism type I. This condition causes excessive adrenal production of aldosterone, leading to hypertension and hypokalemia. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is responsible for steroid hormone synthesis, including aldosterone, so a biopsy of the adrenal gland most likely shows abnormal amounts of smooth ER. Lysosomes and peroxisomes are responsible for different metabolic processes, and beta-adrenergic receptors are not directly involved in aldosterone production."
