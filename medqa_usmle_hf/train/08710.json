The patient's symptoms suggest abruptio placentae, which is characterized by painful contractions, vaginal bleeding, and a hypertonic uterus. Placenta previa presents with painless bleeding and a soft uterus. Uterine rupture presents with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and cessation of contractions. Normal labor does not usually present with vaginal bleeding. The ultrasound result rules out placenta previa, making abruptio placentae the most likely diagnosis."

The presence of painful contractions, vaginal bleeding, and lower abdominal and pelvic pain suggests Abruptio placentae, which is the separation of the placenta from the uterine wall before delivery. The presence of hypertension and a gravid and hypertonic uterus also support this diagnosis, as hypertension is a risk factor for this condition. Ultrasound can rule out other causes such as placenta previa, but in this case, it did not show any abnormalities. Normal labor would not present with vaginal bleeding and uterine rupture would likely have more severe symptoms such as complete cessation of contractions and extreme pain."

The patient's symptoms suggest abruptio placentae, as she has painful contractions and vaginal bleeding after falling off her bike. The hypertonic uterus and moderate blood in the vaginal vault further support this diagnosis. Ultrasound results being normal do not rule out abruptio placentae as it can occur without clear visual abnormalities on ultrasound. Normal labor and placenta previa do not typically present with vaginal bleeding or lower abdominal and pelvic pain between contractions. Uterine rupture may present with similar symptoms, but is less likely given the absence of a previous C-section and lack of a sudden tearing sensation."
