The patient presents with a new acute infarct and a history of previous ischemic stroke, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Dipyridamole is a commonly used medication to prevent further strokes in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Warfarin is not typically used in this situation unless there is evidence of atrial fibrillation or other specific indications for anticoagulation. tPA is not indicated in this case as it is only used in acute ischemic stroke within the first few hours of symptom onset. Increasing aspirin dose to 325 mg is not recommended due to the potential for increased risk of bleeding without significant reduction in stroke risk."

The patient has a history of ischemic stroke and has risk factors for stroke, such as hypertension and diabetes. The MRI shows a new acute infarct, indicating a high risk of future strokes. Dipyridamole, along with aspirin, has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of future strokes in patients with prior stroke or high-risk criteria. Increasing the dosage of aspirin or administering tPA is not recommended. Warfarin is often used for atrial fibrillation, but there is no indication of atrial fibrillation in this case."

The MRI shows atrophic area of the left occipital lobe which is a sign of previous stroke. The echocardiogram reveals mild left ventricular hypertrophy but no other significant findings. Doppler ultrasound is negative for narrowing. Based on these findings, the next step in management to prevent future stroke is to add dipyridamole in addition to aspirin. This combination is more effective than aspirin alone in preventing stroke in patients with a history of prior stroke or other vascular events. The other options are not appropriate in this case as increasing aspirin dose can increase the risk of bleeding, administering tPA is not appropriate as the symptoms have been present for more than 4.5 hours, and stopping aspirin and starting warfarin is not appropriate as the patient has a low-risk profile for atrial fibrillation."

An MRI confirms an acute infarct involving the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. Doppler ultrasound of the carotid arteries reveals no significant narrowing and ECG shows normal sinus rhythm, ruling out cardioembolic causes of stroke. Therefore, the next step in management would be to add dipyridamole to the 81 mg aspirin regimen to further decrease the risk of future strokes. Increasing the aspirin dose to 325 mg is not recommended because there is no evidence to suggest its superiority in preventing strokes and may increase the risk of bleeding. Administering tPA would only be appropriate within a certain time frame of symptom onset and in selected patients who meet criteria for this treatment. Stopping aspirin and starting warfarin would not be appropriate in this case as warfarin is not the first-line anticoagulant for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation and there is no indication for anticoagulation therapy in this patient."
