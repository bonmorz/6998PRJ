The patient's symptoms of headache, nausea, and weakness, along with a 5-cm skull bruise, suggest an intracranial injury. The lack of visual changes or altered mental status suggests that the herniation is not uncal or tonsillar. Subfalcine herniation occurs when the cingulate gyrus is pushed under the falx cerebri, and can result in weakness on one side of the body, consistent with the patient's symptoms. Extracranial herniation is not a known medical term."

The patient's symptoms suggest brain herniation, which is a displacement of brain tissue from one compartment to another. Subfalcine herniation is the most likely cause since there is no midline shift, and it commonly presents with weakness on the contralateral side of the herniation. Tonsillar herniation and uncal herniation present with other symptoms such as pupil dilation and respiratory depression. Extracranial herniation refers to herniation through an opening in the skull."

The fact that muscle strength is 0/5 in her right knee and foot suggests subfalcine herniation, where the cingulate gyrus moves under the falx cerebri and compresses the anterior cerebral artery. Tonsillar herniation, uncal herniation, and extracranial herniation are also potential causes of increased intracranial pressure, but they would present with different symptoms than those described in this case."
