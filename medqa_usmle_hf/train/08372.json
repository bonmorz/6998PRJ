Left anterior descending artery supplies the anterior wall and the septum, and the left main coronary artery is the main source of blood to the entire left side of the heart. Since the patient is presenting with chest pain, vomiting, and diaphoresis, it is highly unlikely that there is no obstruction in his cardiac blood supply."
