A quadruple marker test in a patient with this presentation would show decreased AFP and estriol levels, and increased HCG and Inhibin A levels, matching option B. Option A describes a normal result, which is not expected given the patient's history and physical examination findings. Option C describes a result that would not be consistent with Down syndrome. Option D shows a decrease in all markers, which is not consistent with the increased HCG and Inhibin A levels seen in Down syndrome."

The patient is at increased risk for Down syndrome and other genetic disorders based on the previous ultrasound and chorionic villus sampling results. The quad screen measures four substances in the mother's blood, including AFP, estriol, HCG, and inhibin A. A pattern of decreased AFP, decreased estriol, and increased HCG and inhibin A suggests an increased risk for Down syndrome. Therefore, option B is the correct answer, as it shows decreased levels of AFP and estriol, and increased levels of HCG and inhibin A."
