Elastin fibers contribute to the elasticity of the skin, and a decrease in their assembly can cause the skin to sag and develop wrinkles, making option A the correct answer. Increase in fibroblast activity can lead to increased collagen deposition and can potentially improve firmness in the skin. Lipofuscin deposition and decreased crosslinking of collagen fibrils are not directly related to the development of wrinkles and sagging skin."
