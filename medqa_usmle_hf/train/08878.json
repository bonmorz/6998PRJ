The symptoms, including visual changes, whitish nipple discharge, missed periods, and concerns about menopause, suggest hyperprolactinemia. Elevated serum prolactin levels can help with the diagnosis. A urine pregnancy test may be needed to rule out pregnancy, but it is not the best test for hyperprolactinemia. Serum estrogen and progesterone levels and thyroid stimulating hormone levels may be helpful in other conditions but are not specific for hyperprolactinemia."
