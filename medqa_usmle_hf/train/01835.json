The symptoms, including rash, oral lesions, and vision problems, suggest a possible diagnosis of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The skin lesions in SJS and TEN often start as red spots and progress to bullae and sloughing of the skin. Biopsy and histopathologic analysis of skin lesions is the most definitive diagnostic test for SJS and TEN. Gram stain and culture of skin sample can help rule out bacterial infection, but it is not the most likely diagnostic test for SJS/TEN. Direct immunofluorescence analysis of perilesional skin biopsy can help diagnose immune-mediated diseases, but it is not the most likely diagnostic test for SJS/TEN. Flow cytometry is used to analyze cells and their markers, and is not a diagnostic test for SJS/TEN."
