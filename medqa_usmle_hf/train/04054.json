The symptoms and findings suggest that the most likely diagnosis is necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), which is a serious gastrointestinal disease primarily seen in preterm infants. Although Meckel diverticulum and duodenal atresia can also cause feeding issues in newborns, they are less likely due to the presence of diarrhea and positive stool occult blood. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis typically presents with projectile vomiting and is not associated with bloody diarrhea or abdominal tenderness. The x-ray of the abdomen is consistent with NEC. Immediate treatment is needed to prevent septicemia and death."
