The patient\u2019s symptoms and gastric emptying scan results suggest gastroparesis, which is a common complication in patients with diabetes mellitus. Metoclopramide is a prokinetic agent that promotes gastrointestinal motility and is an appropriate pharmacotherapy for gastroparesis. Dimenhydrinate and ondansetron are antiemetics, which may alleviate nausea but do not address the underlying problem of gastroparesis.
