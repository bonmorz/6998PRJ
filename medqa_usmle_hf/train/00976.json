Given the patient's history of alcoholism and productive cough with foul-smelling sputum, it is likely that he has aspiration pneumonia caused by anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria are gram-positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobes, and can sometimes cause diarrhea due to disruption of normal gut flora. Therefore, the correct answer is (A), which describes an anaerobic bacterial pathogen. The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's clinical presentation."
