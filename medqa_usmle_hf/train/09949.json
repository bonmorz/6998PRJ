The body responds to this by constricting the blood vessels in the skin, which reduces blood flow to the extremities and helps to conserve heat in the core of the body. This is known as cutaneous vasoconstriction and is responsible for maintaining the student's oral temperature even though her hands are much colder.

In this case, despite the hands being exposed to cold water, the body maintains its core temperature through cutaneous vasoconstriction.

The experiment involves exposing the hands to ice-cold water, which causes vasoconstriction of cutaneous blood vessels in the hands, reducing heat loss from the extremities. The body then compensates for the decreased heat loss by increasing internal heat production through mechanisms such as shivering and muscular contraction, but since the student's oral temperature remained stable, the correct answer is cutaneous vasoconstriction. The diving reflex is a similar response to immersion in cold water, but it primarily affects the cardiovascular system rather than body temperature regulation."
