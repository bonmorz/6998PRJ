The drug being referred to here is likely sodium nitroprusside, which is used for hypertensive emergencies such as the patient's high blood pressure. The most severe side effect of this medication is cyanide poisoning, which can occur with prolonged use or excessive dosing. Other side effects such as headache, increased intraocular pressure, and bronchospasm are possible but not as severe."

The most severe side effect of this medication is cyanide poisoning, which can occur with high doses or prolonged infusion. Patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity, including metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, and cardiovascular collapse."

Symptoms of poisoning include confusion, lethargy, seizures, and respiratory depression, and treatment involves immediate discontinuation of the medication and administration of antidotes, such as sodium thiosulfate."
