This condition predisposes the patient to aortic dissection, but this typically occurs in adulthood, not in childhood. Medullary thyroid cancer is not associated with this syndrome. Osteoarthritis may occur later in life but is not a common complication. Thromboembolic stroke is a potential complication due to the increased risk of blood clot formation in Marfan syndrome. Therefore, (D) is the correct answer."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, such as tall stature, joint hypermobility, hyperelastic skin, and downward lens subluxation, are consistent with Marfan syndrome. Patients with Marfan syndrome are at an increased risk for aortic dissection, but this is less likely in a 3-year-old patient. Medullary thyroid cancer is associated with MEN2B syndrome, which also involves tall stature and hyperelastic skin, but the patient\u2019s symptoms do not suggest this. Osteoarthritis is more common in older adults and would not typically be a concern for a 3-year-old patient. Thromboembolic stroke is a possible complication of Marfan syndrome, as patients with this condition are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and blood clots."
