There are different bacteria that can cause pneumonia, but based on the history of leg pain, fever, and cough, the most likely cause is Streptococcus pneumoniae, which can be prevented by an inactivated vaccine. Live attenuated vaccines are used for viral infections, not bacterial. Conjugate vaccines are also used for bacterial infections, but they work by targeting the bacteria's polysaccharide capsule, which is not the case for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Toxoid vaccines are used to prevent diseases caused by bacterial toxins, such as tetanus or diphtheria, and not bacterial infections."

Conjugate vaccines are used to prevent certain types of bacterial infections, but not all types that can cause pneumonia. Toxoid vaccines are used to prevent diseases caused by toxins released by certain bacteria, such as diphtheria and tetanus, but are not effective against bacterial pneumonia. Therefore, the best answer is (B) inactivated vaccine."
