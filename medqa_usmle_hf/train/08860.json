Genetic shift refers to the process in which two different strains of influenza virus exchange genetic material to create a new strain with a combination of genes from both parent strains. This process can occur when two different strains infect the same host cell, as in the scenario in the question. Transduction, transformation, and genetic drift do not involve the exchange of genetic material between different strains of virus."
