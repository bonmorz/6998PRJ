The patient\u2019s symptoms and response to a neck maneuver suggest that the most likely diagnosis is supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Stimulation of afferent fibers from the glossopharyngeal nerve can lead to reflex slowing of the heart rate, which is attributed to increased vagal tone. Therefore, option (C) glossopharyngeal nerve is the most likely nerve responsible for the resolution of her symptoms."
