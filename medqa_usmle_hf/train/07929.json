The spirometer test described in the question is called a Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) test, which measures the maximal amount of air a person can forcefully exhale after a maximal inspiration. Therefore, the volume of expired air represents the vital capacity. Tidal volume is the volume of air inspired or expired during normal breathing at rest, expiratory reserve volume is the maximal volume of air that can be exhaled forcibly after normal expiration, and total lung capacity is the sum of all lung volumes."
