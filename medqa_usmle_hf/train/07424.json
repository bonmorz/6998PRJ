The ventral wing of the third branchial pouch is responsible for the development of the thymus gland, so knock out of this gene may lead to DiGeorge syndrome in humans. One of the features of DiGeorge syndrome is hypoparathyroidism, which can cause carpopedal spasm, but this is not the most likely finding. Conductive hearing loss and cleft palate are also seen in DiGeorge syndrome, but the most specific finding mentioned in the answer choices is white oral patches, which are a characteristic feature of oral thrush/ candidiasis, which can occur in individuals with DiGeorge syndrome due to impaired immune function."
