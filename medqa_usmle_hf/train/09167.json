The absence of red flag symptoms (e.g. weakness or changes in bowel/bladder function), along with normal physical examination results, suggests that the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s lower back pain is musculoskeletal strain. Conservative treatment such as Naproxen and activity as tolerated are appropriate first-line therapies for most cases of acute low back pain. CRP level might be helpful if there is a suspicion of infection, but there is no indication of infection in this case. MRI spine is not necessary at this point and should be reserved for cases with worsening or persistent symptoms."

The absence of leg pain, weakness or change in sensation in the legs, as well as the absence of incontinence, suggests that there is unlikely to be any nerve involvement. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to alleviate the back pain with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as Naproxen and encourage activity as tolerated. An MRI spine may be considered if the pain persists or worsens, or if there are any neurological symptoms. CRP level may not be helpful in this case as it is a nonspecific marker of inflammation. Bed rest may actually delay recovery and cause muscle deconditioning."
