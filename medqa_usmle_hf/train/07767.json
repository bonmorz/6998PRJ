B-Raf is a protein involved in the MAP kinase pathway, which is activated by mutations such as those in the gene that encodes it. These mutations are most commonly caused by thymidine-to-adenine transversion at CpG sites resulting in the formation of covalent bonds between adjacent pyrimidine bases. This results in the activation of downstream pathways and increased cell proliferation, leading to the development of the skin lesion. Double-strand breaks, chromosomal rearrangements, and nucleotide deamination are not associated with the development of B-Raf mutations."
