The patient's symptoms suggest a thalamic stroke, which can cause sensory deficits on one side of the body but not affect the motor strength or cranial nerves. Middle cerebral artery stroke and basilar artery stroke would likely involve more severe motor impairments or cranial nerve deficits. Conversion disorder is a possible explanation for unexplained neurological deficits, but stroke should be ruled out first."

The fact that the patient has loss of sensation on the left side of his face, arm, and leg suggests a lesion in the thalamus, which receives sensory input from these areas. Therefore, the most likely explanation is a thalamic stroke. Option A is incorrect because the middle cerebral artery supplies the lateral surfaces of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, and would cause contralateral hemiparesis or hemisensory deficit involving the face, arm, and leg but not necessarily all three. Option B is incorrect because conversion disorder is a psychiatric condition that presents with neurological-like symptoms that are not explained by underlying organic pathology. Option D is incorrect because the basilar artery stroke would affect cranial nerve function (e.g. cranial nerve VI and VIII)."
