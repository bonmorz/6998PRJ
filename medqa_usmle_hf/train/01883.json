Option (A) is incorrect because there is a clear relationship between RSV and the development of asthma. Option (B) is incorrect because the risk of developing asthma is higher than 5%.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that RSV bronchiolitis is a significant risk factor for the development of reactive airway disease, including asthma. While the exact risk varies depending on the study and population, a common estimate is that there is a greater than 20% chance of developing asthma after RSV bronchiolitis. Therefore, answer choice (C) is the most accurate statement. Answer choice (A) is incorrect, as there is indeed a relationship between RSV and asthma. Answer choice (B) does not provide a realistic estimate of risk, as the actual risk is much higher. Answer choice (D) is incorrect, as children with a history of RSV bronchiolitis have a higher risk of asthma than the general population."
