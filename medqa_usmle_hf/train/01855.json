Fluphenazine is a typical antipsychotic medication and can cause tardive dyskinesia, which is characterized by abnormal involuntary movements, including choreoathetoid movements of face. The psychiatrist likely noticed these movements and realized that continuing the medication could cause irreversible damage.
