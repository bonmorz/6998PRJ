Metformin is used to treat type 2 diabetes, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide are used to treat hypertension, albuterol inhaler is used to treat COPD, fluconazole is used to treat fungal infections, omeprazole and ranitidine are used to treat acid reflux."

The patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes and presents with epigastric pain after food intake, suggesting possible peptic ulcer disease. Omeprazole and ranitidine are commonly used for this condition, but they do not have the side effect of heart palpitations. Erythromycin is sometimes used to promote gastric emptying but can cause QT prolongation and increase the risk of arrhythmias, as seen on the EKG. Therefore, erythromycin is the most likely medication prescribed for the patient\u2019s symptoms."
