The fact that she cannot recall which medications she is taking but believes she is taking them as prescribed suggests that it could be a medication with a narrow therapeutic index, where the ratio of the toxic dose to effective dose is close to 1. Therefore, the answer is (D). High or low potency are not indicative of toxicity."
