The patient\u2019s symptoms, including severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and tenderness and rigidity upon palpation in the right lower quadrant, are consistent with appendicitis. Among the options, only appendiceal lymphoid hyperplasia is related to the appendix, making it the most likely cause. Diverticulum in the terminal ileum is related to the small intestine, while twisting of the spermatic cord is related to the testicles. A structural abnormality of the appendix is too broad and does not specifically suggest appendicitis."
