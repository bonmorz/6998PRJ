The Hawthorne effect occurs when study participants modify their behavior simply because they are aware that they are being observed, leading to improvements in compliance even in the absence of an intervention. This is the most likely explanation for the finding in the study, as there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of demographics or medical history, and procedure bias and Pygmalion effect are unlikely to play a role. Recall bias is also not relevant in this scenario, as objective biomarkers were used to measure compliance rather than self-reported data."

The Pygmalion effect refers to a phenomenon where people perform better because they are expected to perform better, which should not apply in this study since both groups were randomized.
