The inability to abduct the arm above 90 degrees and protrusion of the medial aspect of the scapula suggests an injury to the long thoracic nerve, which supplies the serratus anterior muscle that stabilizes the scapula during arm movement. Injury to the upper trunk of the brachial plexus would cause Erb's palsy, which affects shoulder abduction and external rotation. The suprascapular nerve innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, which help shoulder abduction and external rotation. The thoracodorsal nerve innervates the latissimus dorsi muscle, which is responsible for shoulder adduction, extension, and medial rotation, and would not cause the symptoms described."
