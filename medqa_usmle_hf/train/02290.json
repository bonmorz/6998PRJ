The visual blurring and falls suggest a vestibular side effect, which is associated with aminoglycoside antibiotics that inhibit the 30S ribosomal subunit.

The patient was started on a broad-spectrum combination intravenous antibiotic, and the symptoms of transient visual blurring and falling suggest a potential adverse effect of the medication. Among the options, only those that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis (options A and B) are commonly associated with visual disturbances and falls. The fact that the patient was allergic to fluoroquinolones, which inhibit DNA gyrase (option D), rules out this option. The most likely culprit is therefore an antibiotic that inhibits the 30S ribosomal subunit, which includes drugs such as aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and macrolides."

The broad-spectrum combination intravenous antibiotic most likely contains a drug that inhibits the 30S subunit of the ribosome, such as an aminoglycoside, which can cause ototoxicity and vestibular toxicity, resulting in transient visual blurring and falls. Options B and C inhibit the 50S subunit and dihydropteroate synthase, respectively, which are not associated with these symptoms. Option D inhibits DNA gyrase, which can cause musculoskeletal symptoms but not visual blurring."
