The presentation suggests congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which is most commonly caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This deficiency leads to decreased cortisol and aldosterone production, causing the symptoms of hypotension and hyperkalemia. Elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone in the urine is also indicative of this deficiency. Angiotensin II, DHT, and 11-hydroxylase are not directly involved in the synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone and are not associated with CAH."
