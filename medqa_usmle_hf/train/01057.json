With a 50% stenosis, the area of stenosis is half of the total area, resulting in a % decrease of 50%. To calculate the factor by which the flow has been decreased, we convert the % decrease to a decimal by dividing by 100 (i.e. 50% = 0.5). Then we use the formula: factor = 1/ (1 - % decrease). Plugging in 0.5 for % decrease, we get a factor of 1/(1-0.5) = 2. However, the question is asking for the factor compared to a normal artery with no stenosis, so we need to calculate the ratio between the two factors: 16/1 = 16.

As there is a 50% stenosis, the radius is decreased to approximately 71% of its original value. Therefore, the flow would be decreased by a factor of (0.71)^4 which is approximately 0.16 or 1/6.

Assuming that the cross-sectional area of the artery remains constant, we can compare the velocities of blood flow before and after the stenosis. The equation for the velocity of blood flow through an artery is v = (pressure gradient \u00d7 vessel radius^4) / (8 x viscosity x vessel length). We can assume that the pressure gradient, viscosity, and vessel length are constant. The vessel radius is reduced by half due to the stenosis since the area is reduced by 50%. Using this information, we can calculate the velocity of blood flow after the stenosis, which is 16 times slower than before the stenosis. Therefore, the flow rate is reduced by a factor of 16, and the answer is (C)."

In other words, the cross-sectional area of the artery is reduced by a factor of 4 (2 squared). According to Poiseuille's Law, the flow of blood is directly proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the vessel, meaning that a 50% reduction in radius results in a 16-fold (2 to the fourth power) decrease in blood flow.

Assuming all other variables remain constant, we can compare the flow rate in the stenotic vessel to the flow rate in a normal vessel of the same size. We can use the fact that the radius of a vessel is proportional to the square root of the cross-sectional area, and that the cross-sectional area is proportional to the radius squared. Therefore, if the vessel has a 50% stenosis, the cross-sectional area (and hence the radius) of the vessel is decreased by a factor of (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Plugging this value into the equation above, we find that the flow rate in the stenotic vessel is decreased by a factor of (1/4)^4 = 1/256, or approximately 0.004. This means that the flow rate has been decreased by a factor of approximately 1/0.004, or 250. Therefore, the answer is (C) 16."

The equation is \u0394P = 4v\u00b2 where \u0394P is the pressure gradient, v is the velocity of blood flow, and the units are mmHg. Rearranging the equation, we get v = \u221a(\u0394P/4), which tells us that the velocity of blood flow is proportional to the square root of the pressure gradient. Since the pressure gradient is directly proportional to the degree of stenosis, we can calculate the decrease in blood flow as follows:\n\nDegree of stenosis = 50%\nPressure gradient = 50% of normal = 0.5\nVelocity of blood flow = \u221a(0.5/4) = 0.35 times normal\nFlow of blood = velocity x cross-sectional area of the artery\nAssuming the cross-sectional area is constant, the flow of blood is decreased by a factor of (0.35)\u00b2 = 0.1225\nTherefore, the flow of blood has been decreased by a factor of approximately 1/8 or 16%.
