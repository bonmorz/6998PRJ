Trisomy 21 may present with a protruding tongue but it is unlikely to cause the other symptoms.

The enlarged tongue, poor feeding, lethargy, and decreased muscle tone are due to hypothyroidism, while the protruding mass at the umbilicus indicates an umbilical hernia commonly seen in newborns with hypothyroidism. Acid maltase deficiency causes Pompe disease which presents with muscle weakness and enlarged liver, while trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) and chromosome 11p alteration (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome) have different characteristic features."

Acid maltase deficiency is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but this is not present in the case. Trisomy 21 is associated with developmental delay and characteristic facial features, neither of which are mentioned in the case. Chromosome 11p alteration is associated with Wilms tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma, but the presence of a reducible umbilical mass is not specific to this condition."

The distended abdomen with a reducible, soft protruding mass at the umbilicus suggests an umbilical hernia, which is common in hypothyroidism. Thyroid dysgenesis is a cause of congenital hypothyroidism. Acid maltase deficiency (also known as Pompe disease) presents with hypotonia and muscle weakness, but not typically with enlarged tongue or umbilical hernia. Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) can present with similar symptoms to hypothyroidism, but typically has distinctive facial features which are not mentioned in the question stem. Chromosome 11p alteration is a non-specific answer choice and does not provide enough information to diagnose the patient."
