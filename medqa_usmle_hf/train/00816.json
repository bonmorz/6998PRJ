Among the options, only the distal convoluted tubule is affected in Bartter syndrome. The decreased urinary calcium and increased urinary chloride are also consistent with this diagnosis."

The patient's symptoms and abnormal laboratory values suggest hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, which can be caused by excessive potassium loss or inadequate intake. The fact that the urine chloride level is elevated suggests a renal cause for the potassium loss. The distal convoluted tubule is responsible for potassium reabsorption or secretion, depending on the body's needs. Thus, impaired function of the distal convoluted tubule is the most likely cause of this patient's condition."
