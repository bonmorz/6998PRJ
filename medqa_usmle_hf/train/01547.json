The most appropriate management for traumatic hemorrhagic shock associated with coagulopathy and massive bleeding is the early and aggressive use of blood components, specifically packed RBCs, fresh frozen plasma, and platelet concentrate in a 1:1:1 ratio in order to correct hemostatic deficit. Therefore, the correct answer is (A). All other options do not provide the appropriate ratio of blood components needed to correct the coagulopathy."

The patient has evidence of acute coagulopathy of trauma, which is characterized by early activation of anticoagulant pathways, resulting in a decreased ability to form clots. The most appropriate management is transfusion of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelet concentrate in a 1:1:1 ratio. This is known as the optimal transfusion strategy for trauma patients with bleeding, as it aims to balance the relative deficiencies in clotting factors, platelets, and red blood cells. Option B is incorrect because it does not address the need for red blood cells. Option C is insufficient as it does not address the coagulopathy. Option D provides fresh frozen plasma but still does not address the need for platelets."
