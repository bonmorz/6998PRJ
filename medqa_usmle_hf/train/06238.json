The symptoms and signs suggest right heart failure, which impairs relaxation of the right ventricle and leads to systemic venous congestion and edema. Reduced glomerular filtration rate can lead to edema, but it is less likely with normal laboratory studies. Dermal deposition of glycosaminoglycans is seen in mucopolysaccharidoses, which manifest with joint stiffness and abnormal skeletal development. Macrovesicular steatosis of the liver is non-specific and unlikely to cause edema."

Dermal deposition of glycosaminoglycans is associated with conditions such as scleroderma and is unlikely in this case.
