The symptoms of fever and costovertebral angle tenderness suggest pyelonephritis, which is typically caused by a bacterial infection. Biopsy of the kidney would show tubular colloid casts with diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, indicative of inflammation and infection in the renal tubules. Mononuclear and eosinophilic infiltrate would be seen in interstitial nephritis, which is typically drug-induced. Replacement of renal parenchyma with foamy histiocytes would be seen in conditions such as Fabry disease or lipoid nephrosis. Destruction of the proximal tubule and medullary thick ascending limb would be seen in ischemic renal injury, toxins, or drugs."
