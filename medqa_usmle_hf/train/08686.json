The patient's age, Tanner stage, and lack of abnormalities on examination suggest that physiologic leukorrhea is the most likely diagnosis. The patient's diabetes may increase the risk of vaginal candidiasis, but there are no symptoms to suggest it. The patient does not want to share information regarding sexual activity, so trichomoniasis cannot be ruled out. A vaginal foreign body is unlikely given the absence of symptoms and normal wet mount results."

Physiologic leukorrhea is a normal physiological discharge that can occur during puberty and is characterized by a white, thin, odorless vaginal discharge. The absence of abnormalities in the wet mount and the patient's Tanner stage II development suggest that this is the most likely diagnosis. Vaginal foreign body may present with similar symptoms but would require removal of the foreign object. Trichomoniasis and vaginal candidiasis typically present with more significant symptoms such as itching, irritation, and inflammation. However, it is important to note that sexual activity cannot be ruled out without further information, and therefore other causes such as sexually transmitted infections should not be completely ruled out."
