Chronic atrophic gastritis is an autoimmune disease that destroys parietal cells, leading to decreased acid secretion, and may increase the risk of gastric cancer. Option A is incorrect because chronic gastritis can cause Vitamin B12 deficiency, not folate deficiency. Option B describes Helicobacter pylori gastritis, which is different from chronic atrophic gastritis. Option C is a possible complication of MALT lymphoma, which can be associated with chronic atrophic gastritis, but not a characteristic of chronic atrophic gastritis. Option D is correct as it describes the mechanism of destruction in chronic atrophic gastritis, which is mediated by T cells."
