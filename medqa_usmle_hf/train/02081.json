Beta-blockers reduce heart rate and cardiac output, but they do not directly affect blood pressure. In fact, sudden withdrawal of beta-blockers can cause rebound hypertension. Therefore, the patient\u2019s blood pressure may actually increase due to alpha-1-adrenergic receptor stimulation, which can occur as a compensatory mechanism in response to beta-blockade. Option (C) is the correct answer."

Metoprolol is a selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist, meaning it blocks the effects of adrenaline on the heart.

In this patient, whose symptoms suggest that the cause of hypertension is related to alpha-1-adrenergic receptor stimulation, metoprolol would not effectively lower her blood pressure. In fact, it may worsen her symptoms due to unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Therefore, another medication targeting alpha-1 adrenergic receptors may be needed for this patient."

The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of a possible pheochromocytoma or other catecholamine excess disorder. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker, which may decrease heart rate and cardiac output, but it does not address the catecholamine excess that may be driving the patient's hypertension. In fact, blocking beta-adrenergic receptors may lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation, causing hypertension. Therefore, the patient's blood pressure may increase due to alpha-1-adrenergic receptor stimulation when given metoprolol. It is important to address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and hypertension, which may require additional testing and treatment."
