The fact that the symptoms worsen with exercise and improve with rest suggests that it is a disorder of muscle glycogenolysis, specifically myophosphorylase deficiency. Acid maltase deficiency is also a glycogen storage disease, but it presents differently with respiratory difficulties and cardiac involvement. Thyroid hormone deficiency is known to cause muscle weakness but not muscle cramps and pain. CTG repeat in the DMPK gene is associated with myotonic dystrophy, but this condition presents differently with muscle stiffness and wasting. The presence of blood in urine may suggest a myoglobinuria, which is associated with myophosphorylase deficiency."
