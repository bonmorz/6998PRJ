Conn syndrome, also known as primary hyperaldosteronism, involves the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland, which produces aldosterone. Pheochromocytomas, on the other hand, involve the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, which produce catecholamines such as adrenaline and noradrenaline. Therefore, the correct answer is B, which indicates that Conn syndrome involves the zona glomerulosa and pheochromocytomas involve the adrenal medulla."
