The allantois is a fetal structure that connects the bladder to the umbilicus in early development and should usually obliterate by the time of birth. If it persists, urine can leak from the umbilicus. Abnormal fusion of the urethral folds can cause hypospadias, failed closure of the vitelline duct can cause meckel diverticulum, and infection of the umbilical cord stump can cause omphalitis, but none of these conditions fit the symptoms described."
