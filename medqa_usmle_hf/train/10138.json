The parasite mentioned in this question, N. americanus, is known to be targeted by eosinophils via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The antibody isotype required for this process is IgE, which is known to trigger the release of eosinophils and other immune cells to fight parasitic infections. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) IgE."
