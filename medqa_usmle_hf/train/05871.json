The facial asymmetry suggests Bell's palsy, a condition often associated with diabetes, which can be evaluated with HBA1c levels. The ear pain and discharge suggest an external auditory canal infection, which is often associated with poor hygiene and can be exacerbated by underlying medical conditions such as diabetes. Malignant epithelial growth and opacified mastoid air cells are less likely based on the presentation. Streptococcus pneumoniae may cause an ear infection, but there is no specific indication for this organism in this patient's case."

However, since the patient is homeless and malodorous, it is more likely that he has uncontrolled diabetes, as elevated HBA1c can lead to impaired immune system function, making him susceptible to infections like otitis externa. Streptococcus pneumoniae is not typically associated with otitis externa. Opacified mastoid air cells suggests mastoiditis, which is a complication of otitis media, not otitis externa."
