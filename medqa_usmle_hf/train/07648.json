Her brother has the disease because he inherited two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent. The intended father has no history of the disease, so we assume that he does not carry the mutated gene. The risk of their offspring developing the disease can be calculated using a Punnett square or a simple application of the laws of probability. The chance of the offspring inheriting the mutated gene from the patient is 50% (since she is a carrier), and the chance of inheriting the mutated gene from the intended father is 0%. Therefore, the overall chance of the offspring inheriting the disease is 0.5 x 0.00025 (the chance of two carriers having a child with the disease, calculated as 1/4 x 1/40,000) or 0.000125, which is approximately 0.0125% or 0.2%.
