According to the article, babbling occurs between 6 and 9 months of age, cooing occurs between 2 and 4 months of age, saying words such as apple and cat is a milestone at around 12 months of age, and two-word combinations occur between 18 and 24 months of age. Given the child is able to sit unsupported and feed himself, we can assume he is older than 6 months. The fact that he is shaking his toy bear and able to stop upon hearing \"no\" suggests some understanding of language, but he is not yet saying words. Therefore, the most likely language milestone he presents with is babbling."

At this age, babbling is the most likely language milestone, as it usually starts around 6 months when infants start to produce more complex sounds by putting together consonants and vowels. Cooing usually occurs at around 1-2 months of age, saying words around 9-12 months, and two-word combinations around 18 months."
