Protamine sulfate is used to reverse the anticoagulant effects of heparin, which the patient was likely receiving for her DVT. Fresh frozen plasma could also be used to replace clotting factors, but the quicker and more specific option would be protamine sulfate. Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent and could worsen the bleeding. Prothrombin complex concentrate is used for vitamin K antagonist reversal and is not appropriate in this case."

Given the patient's history of deep vein thrombosis, it is likely that she is on anticoagulant therapy, which can cause bleeding. The laboratory studies show a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, indicating a possible deficiency in factor VIII or IX. Protamine sulfate can rapidly reverse the effect of heparin, which is commonly used to treat deep vein thrombosis, and also partially reverse the effect of warfarin, another anticoagulant. Therefore, Protamine sulfate is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy in this scenario."
