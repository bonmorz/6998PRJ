Small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) are involved in pre-mRNA splicing and their inactivation would likely affect the removal of introns during mRNA processing. Therefore, the correct answer is (D). The other options are not directly related to snRNPs. Aminoacylation of tRNA is catalyzed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes, which are not directly involved with snRNPs. Activity of 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 proofreading is a function of DNA polymerase, which is involved in DNA replication and not RNA processing. Unwinding of DNA strands is a process involving helicase enzymes and is also not related to snRNPs."
