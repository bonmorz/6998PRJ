Lead-time bias occurs when earlier detection of a disease makes the disease appear to be less severe, or when a screening test misclassifies a healthy individual as having the disease. In this study, the use of breast MRI may have led to earlier detection of breast cancer, which could result in a longer survival time. Therefore, lead-time bias may be affecting the results. Misclassification bias refers to the systematic errors in assigning exposure or disease status, recall bias is related to errors in the collection of exposure or outcome data, and randomized controlled trials can still have bias."

This bias can produce the illusion that the intervention (MRI) is superior, even though it does not improve actual survival.
