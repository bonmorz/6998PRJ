The patient\u2019s past history of repeated self-harm attempts, mood swings, and relationship instability suggests Borderline personality disorder. Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by grandiosity and lack of empathy, but the patient did not display these traits in the scenario. Cyclothymic disorder is a type of bipolar disorder, but the scenario does not provide evidence of characteristic symptoms such as manic episodes. Bipolar II disorder is characterized by hypomanic and depressive episodes, but there is no evidence of hypomania in the scenario."

Cyclothymic disorder involves mood swings but they are less severe than in bipolar disorder. Narcissistic personality disorder is not typically associated with self-harm, mood swings, or outbursts of physical aggression."
