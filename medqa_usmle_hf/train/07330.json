The mutation described in the question is a cytosine to uracil transition, which is repaired by base excision repair (BER) pathway. The initial step in this pathway is the creation of an empty sugar-phosphate site by a DNA glycosylase enzyme, which recognizes and cleaves the base from the sugar-phosphate backbone. This leads to the formation of an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, which is then repaired by other enzymes in the BER pathway. Therefore, the correct answer is (D)."

The question describes a DNA repair mechanism called base excision repair, which involves the creation of an empty sugar-phosphate site at the site of the damaged cytosine residue.

The resulting empty site can then be filled in with the correct nucleotide by other enzymes in the repair pathway. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Creation of empty sugar-phosphate site."

The initial step in repairing these types of mutations is the creation of an empty sugar-phosphate site, which is done by Uracil DNA Glycosylase. This is because the Uracil base does not belong in DNA, and Uracil DNA Glycosylase removes it by cleaving the N-glycosylic bond between the Uracil base and the sugar."
