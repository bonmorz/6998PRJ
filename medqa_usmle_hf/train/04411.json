Lipoid nephrosis is another name for minimal change disease, which also causes nephrotic syndrome but has a different histologic appearance. Diabetic glomerulonephropathy is associated with diabetes mellitus and typically presents with proteinuria, hypertension, and elevated creatinine, but the patient in the scenario does not have a history of diabetes."
