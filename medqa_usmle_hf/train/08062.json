The patient\u2019s symptoms, including intermittent crying, vomiting, passage of stool containing blood and mucous, and a sausage-shaped abdominal mass suggest intussusception, a medical emergency that requires prompt intervention to reduce the telescoping bowel. Air enema is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient to reduce the intussusception. Exploratory laparotomy is not the first-line management of intussusception. X-ray and MRI may help diagnose intussusception, but they are not the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient."
