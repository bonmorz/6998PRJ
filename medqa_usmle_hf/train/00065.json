Closed-loop communication is a process that includes a sender transmitting a message, a receiver receiving the message, and the receiver acknowledging that they have received the message. This process helps to confirm that a message has been correctly transmitted and understood, which can minimize the risk of errors in communication. Therefore, implementing closed-loop communication would be the most appropriate management to minimize the risk of this particular error in the future. The other options are methods used in healthcare to identify and prevent errors, but closed-loop communication specifically addresses communication errors."
