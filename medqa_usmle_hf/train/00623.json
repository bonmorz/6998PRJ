The patient has symptoms of hypertension, frequent voiding, and headaches, and lab results show elevated PAC:PRA ratio and lack of aldosterone suppression. The CT scan also shows a mass on the left side, indicating primary aldosteronism. Adrenal venous sampling is the recommended next step to confirm the diagnosis and determine whether the mass is a unilateral source of aldosterone production. Left laparoscopic adrenalectomy may be considered if a unilateral source is confirmed. Treatment with eplerenone may be considered as a medical therapy, but adrenal venous sampling is necessary to confirm the diagnosis first. Renal angiogram is not indicated in this case."
