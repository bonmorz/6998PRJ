According to current guidelines, ESAs should only be used to maintain hemoglobin levels between 10 and 11.5 g/dL in CKD patients and only when the hemoglobin level is < 10 g/dL in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. ESAs are not recommended for breast or cervical cancer patients, and their effectiveness is reduced when iron levels are low."

Option (A) is incorrect because studies have not consistently shown survival benefit in patients with breast and cervical cancers. Option (B) is incorrect because ESAs are only recommended in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving chemotherapy that is not curative intent. Option (D) is incorrect because ESAs are most effective in patients with CKD who have adequate iron stores. The correct answer is (C), as ESAs should only be initiated in patients with CKD when the hemoglobin level is < 10 g/dL."
