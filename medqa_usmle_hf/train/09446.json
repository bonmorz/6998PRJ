The patient presents with fever, chills, abdominal pain, and tenderness on palpation of the right hypochondrium, which suggests ascending cholangitis. The ultrasound confirms the presence of a calculus in the bile duct, which can cause a blockage and lead to cholangitis. Liver abscess presents with fever, chills, and pain in the right upper quadrant, but there is typically no bile duct dilation. Cholecystitis presents with pain in the right upper quadrant, but there is typically no bile duct dilation or jaundice. Appendicitis presents with pain in the right lower quadrant."
