The patient has a history of elevated blood pressure and presents with a high reading during her visit, but reports normal readings in the past. This suggests the possibility of white coat hypertension, where the patient's anxiety in the medical setting causes elevated readings. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can help differentiate between white coat hypertension and sustained hypertension. Measuring TSH and free T4 or creatinine level would not be relevant in this case. Simply repeating vital signs at the next visit may not provide enough information to accurately assess the patient's blood pressure."

Given the patient's history of missed appointments, anxiety during the exam, and variability in blood pressure readings, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (option D) would be the most appropriate test to further evaluate this patient's hypertension. This test would allow for multiple readings of blood pressure over a 24-hour period and can help diagnose white coat hypertension (elevated blood pressure in the doctor's office due to anxiety) versus sustained hypertension. Options A, B, and C do not address the issue of variability in the patient's blood pressure readings."
