The physical examination findings, such as diminished thoracic expansion, crackles, and a systolic murmur heard on the tricuspid foci suggest right heart failure. The lung CT and transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed right heart failure and severe pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cor pulmonale, which is right-sided heart failure resulting from pulmonary causes. Left-sided heart failure, coronary artery disease, and Budd-chiari syndrome are unlikely given the present symptoms and physical findings."
