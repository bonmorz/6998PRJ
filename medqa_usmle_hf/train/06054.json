The microcytic anemia with target cells and nucleated red cells suggest a hemolytic anemia. The low hemoglobin and MCV along with the absence of HbA on hemoglobin electrophoresis indicate a beta-thalassemia. Alpha-thalassemia major would have severe anemia and hydrops fetalis. G6PD deficiency would present with acute hemolysis in response to oxidative stress. Sickle cell disease would have sickled red blood cells on the peripheral blood smear."

The patient presents with symptoms of anemia, including abdominal distension, poor feeding, and failure to thrive, along with microcytic red cells and target cells on the peripheral blood smear. This suggests a diagnosis of beta-thalassemia major, which is characterized by severe anemia due to deficient production of beta-globin chains. The patient's ethnic background, along with the microcytic anemia, also supports this diagnosis. Other options like Alpha-thalassemia, G6PD deficiency, and Sickle cell disease do not result in the specific combination of symptoms and peripheral blood smear findings seen in this patient."

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency can cause hemolysis but does not present with microcytic red cells or target cells. Sickle cell disease may cause similar symptoms and laboratory findings but is less likely to present with hepatosplenomegaly and parietal and frontal bossing of the skull."
