Barium swallow is contraindicated in this case as it can exacerbate the issue by further weakening the esophageal wall. Urgent surgery may be required in some cases, but the patient\u2019s stable vital signs and lack of peritoneal signs suggest that a less invasive approach may be tried first. Gastrografin swallow is the best option at this point as it can confirm the diagnosis and help guide management."

Gastrografin swallow is the best next step in management because it can help determine if there is any perforation or leakage that could be causing the symptoms, and if so, it can help guide further management. Surgery and ultrasound are not appropriate for this situation, and while a barium swallow could also be used to diagnose esophageal dysphagia, it carries a higher risk of complications than a Gastrografin swallow."
