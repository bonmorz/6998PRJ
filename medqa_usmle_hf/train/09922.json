In this case, the patient's severe abdominal pain and history of peptic ulcer suggest peritonitis. Forced cough elicits abdominal pain is the non-invasive maneuver that would be most helpful in confirming the diagnosis of peritonitis in this patient. It is known as the Markle sign and indicates peritoneal irritation. Pain aroused with gentle intensity/pressure at the costovertebral angle suggests kidney inflammation or infection. Rectal examination showing guaiac positive stool suggests gastrointestinal bleeding. Absent bowel sounds on auscultation suggest intestinal obstruction."
