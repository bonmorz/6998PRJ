The most common mutation, F508del, leads to defective maturation and early degradation of the protein. Option (B) disordered regulation and (C) decreased chloride transport both relate to the function of the protein, but don't pertain to the specific mechanism of the F508del mutation. Option (D) describes a different mechanism unrelated to protein maturation and degradation."

The most common mutation associated with cystic fibrosis is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del) in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. This mutation leads to a misfolded protein that is defective in maturation and is rapidly degraded, resulting in decreased cell surface expression and function of the CFTR protein. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) defective maturation and early degradation of the protein."
