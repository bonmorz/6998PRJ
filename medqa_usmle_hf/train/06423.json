The patient has no history of abnormal Pap smears but she is sexually active with multiple partners, which increases her risk of HPV infection. The fact that her mother has breast cancer and she is in the appropriate age group makes mammography an appropriate recommendation, but it is not the most appropriate at this time. Syphilis testing should be considered if she engages in high-risk sexual behavior or if she has symptoms suggestive of syphilis. HPV testing is not recommended for routine screening in this age group. Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation at this time is HPV vaccination, as she is in the appropriate age group and has not yet received the vaccine."
