The symptoms, along with the presence of hepatosplenomegaly and oral ulcers, suggest that he is experiencing disseminated fungal infection. Among the options, Histoplasma capsulatum is the most likely causal pathogen, as it commonly causes disseminated infection in immunocompromised individuals. The photomicrograph of a liver biopsy specimen may show evidence of the infection, but is not necessary for the diagnosis."
