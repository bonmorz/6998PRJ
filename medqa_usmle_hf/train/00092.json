                "content": "The inheritance of red-green color blindness is X-linked recessive, which means that the gene is located on the X chromosome. Males only have one X chromosome, so they are more likely to be affected than females who have two X chromosomes. A phenotypically normal male is likely to have only one X chromosome carrying the dominant allele, while a female will have two X chromosomes, with one carrying the dominant allele and the other carrying the recessive allele. The chance of both parents passing on the recessive allele to their child is 1/4, or 0.25. Therefore, the probability of a phenotypically normal male and female having a child with red-green color blindness is 1/4 x 1/200, or 1/800. This is equivalent to 0.00125 or approximately 1/800, which corresponds to answer choice (D)."

Since red-green color blindness is X-linked recessive, it means that the gene for color blindness is located on the X chromosome. Males have one X and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. When a male with red-green color blindness (XcY) mates with a phenotypically normal female (XDXD), their offspring will all be normal females (XDXD) and carrier males (XcY) because the Y chromosome is not able to carry the gene for color blindness. When a carrier male (XcY) mates with a normal female (XDXD), their offspring will have a 50% chance of being normal females (XDXD) and a 50% chance of being carrier males (XcY). Thus, the probability of a phenotypically normal couple having a child with red-green color blindness is 1/4 (or 1/2 x 1/2), which is equal to 1/400. So, the correct answer is (D)."

Since the trait is X-linked recessive, we can represent the genotype of a phenotypically normal male as XY and that of a phenotypically normal female as XX. We know that the male is not a carrier because he does not have the trait, so his X chromosome can only carry the dominant allele. The female, on the other hand, has a 50% chance of being a carrier because she has two X chromosomes. The Punnett square for this cross is:\n\n     X  Y\nX | XX | XY\nX | XX | XY\n\nFrom this square, we can see that all the daughters will be carriers (XX) and all the sons will be normal (XY). The probability of a son with red-green color blindness is 0, so the answer is (D) 1/400."
