There would also be a decrease in sensitivity, which means that some patients with agranulocytosis would be missed by the test.

The question asks how changing the cutoff value for ANC would affect the test performance with regard to agranulocytosis. Changing the cutoff value from 500/mm3 to 750/mm3 would result in a higher threshold for what is considered severe neutropenia. This means that some patients with milder cases of neutropenia may not meet the new threshold and be considered false positives. Therefore, the answer is (C) increased false positives. The positive predictive value of the test may decrease because the proportion of true positives to false positives is likely to decrease as a result of the change in the cutoff value."

True positives are the number of correctly identified patients with agranulocytosis. False positives are the number of patients without agranulocytosis who are incorrectly identified as having it. Sensitivity is the proportion of true positive results among all patients with the disease. By changing the cutoff value to 750/mm3, the ANC would become less sensitive, as it would miss patients with agranulocytosis who have an ANC between 500 and 750/mm3. However, there would be fewer false positives, as patients with ANC between 500 and 750/mm3 would not be incorrectly identified as having agranulocytosis.

It would not affect sensitivity or true positives, as these would be based on the same ANC values regardless of the cutoff. However, it may decrease the positive predictive value, as the likelihood of a patient with an ANC between 500-750/mm3 actually developing agranulocytosis may be lower than for those with ANC below 500/mm3."
