The symptoms and CSF analysis suggest bacterial meningitis, and the presence of leptomeningeal enhancement on CT scan confirms the diagnosis.

Option A only covers for gram-positive organisms, while option C only covers for gram-negative organisms. Option B is a possible choice but cefotaxime may not cover all possible causative organisms."
