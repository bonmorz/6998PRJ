The non-blanching raised erythematous papules on the lower extremities are consistent with palpable purpura, a classic finding in IgA nephropathy. The ultrasound findings suggest bowel involvement, as this disease can sometimes involve the gut. P-ANCA vasculitis and Gram-negative cocci infection are less likely to have these findings, while microthrombi occluding the vasculature is more consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy."

The symptoms and laboratory findings suggest the patient has Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP), which is characterized by palpable purpura, arthritis, abdominal pain, and renal involvement. The ultrasonography findings of alternating echogenic and hypoechogenic bands suggest bowel edema, a common finding in HSP. The deposition of IgA immune complexes causes the inflammation and damage in HSP. Option A is incorrect because P-ANCA vasculitis affects medium-sized vessels, not small vessels like in HSP. Option B is incorrect because microthrombi do not cause dysmorphic RBCs and proteinuria, which are seen in HSP. Option C is incorrect because there is no evidence of infection."

The symptoms and laboratory findings suggest Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP), which is characterized by non-blanching raised erythematous papules, abdominal pain and vomiting, joint pain, and glomerulonephritis. The positive fecal occult blood test suggests gastrointestinal involvement. IgA immune complexes are deposited in the small vessels leading to vasculitis, which can explain the ultrasound findings. P-ANCA vasculitis involves larger vessels and is less likely to present in children. Microthrombi and gram-negative cocci infection are less likely based on the laboratory findings."

The RBC with dysmorphic features, positive stool occult blood, and echogenic and hypoechogenic bands in the bowels on ultrasound also support this diagnosis. HSP is caused by the deposition of IgA immune complexes in small vessels. Options A and C do not fit with the clinical presentation, and option B may fit with the symptoms but is not the underlying cause of the condition."

The patient has symptoms of abdominal pain and vomiting, as well as joint pain and a rash, which suggest a systemic disorder. The positive stool test for occult blood and the presence of dysmorphic RBCs in the urine suggest glomerulonephritis. The ultrasonography findings of alternating echogenic and hypoechogenic bands suggest mesenteric vasculitis or ischemia. The presence of IgA immune complex deposition is consistent with Henoch-Schonlein purpura, a systemic vasculitis that affects small vessels including the mesenteric vessels. Thus, (D) is the correct answer."

The presence of non-blanching raised erythematous papules, joint pain, and positive stool for occult blood, along with dysmorphic RBCs and IgA deposition, suggests the most likely cause is IgA immune complex deposition, indicating Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Microthrombi would have showed up in the laboratory studies and ultrasound as well, but it did not. Gram-negative cocci infection would have presented with different symptoms, and P-ANCA vasculitis of small vessels usually occurs in older patients."
