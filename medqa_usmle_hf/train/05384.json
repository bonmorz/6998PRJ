The normal levels of 17\u03b1-Hydroxyprogesterone and testosterone indicate that the excess hair growth is not due to a tumor of granulosa-theca cells of the ovary. The normal fasting glucose and serum studies rule out peripheral insulin resistance and deficiency of 21-hydroxylase. Increased activity of 5-alpha reductase can lead to the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which is responsible for the development of male sexual characteristics like hirsutism. Therefore, (A) is the correct answer."

Elevated dihydrotestosterone (DHT) indicates increased activity of 5-alpha reductase, which converts testosterone to DHT, leading to excessive hair growth. Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase would cause elevated 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone, which is within normal range in this patient. Peripheral insulin resistance and tumor of granulosa-theca cells of the ovary are less likely causes of hirsutism in this patient."

Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase would lead to cortisol deficiency and cause salt wasting. Peripheral insulin resistance can be a feature of PCOS but is not the underlying cause of excessive hair growth. Tumor of granulosa-theca cells of the ovary is a rare cause of excessive hair growth and would likely have different lab findings."

The midcycle serum studies show elevated levels of dihydrotestosterone, which suggests an increased activity of the enzyme 5-alpha reductase. This enzyme converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which stimulates hair growth. Therefore, (A) is the most likely underlying cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms. (B) is related to congenital adrenal hyperplasia and (D) is related to ovarian tumors, but neither is supported by the given information. Peripheral insulin resistance may be seen in polycystic ovary syndrome, but that would not lead to an increase in dihydrotestosterone levels."

The elevated levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) suggest increased activity of 5-alpha reductase, which converts testosterone to DHT, a more potent androgen. Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase (Option B) can cause hirsutism, but it usually presents earlier in life and is associated with other features such as salt wasting and ambiguous genitalia. Peripheral insulin resistance (Option C) can cause hyperinsulinemia, which can stimulate ovarian androgen production and contribute to hirsutism, but the patient does not have any indications of insulin resistance. Tumor of granulosa-theca cells of the ovary (Option D) can cause excess androgen production, but the testosterone level is only slightly elevated and the LH/FSH ratio does not suggest an ovarian source of androgens."
