The patient\u2019s symptoms and recent travel history suggest that he has contracted a bacterial infection, most likely caused by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). EHEC usually invades and damages the colonic microfold (M) cells. Therefore, (A) invasion of colonic microfold cells is the most likely process involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition. Overactivation of adenylate cyclase is involved in cholera, dissemination via bloodstream is seen in typhoid fever, and flagella-mediated gut colonization is seen in some strains of Salmonella."

The symptoms and history of recent travel to Mexico suggests that the patient has a bacterial infection, most likely caused by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). EHEC colonizes in the gut and releases Shiga toxins which can damage the intestinal lining. Invasion of colonic microfold (M) cells is the mechanism by which pathogens, including EHEC, can enter the intestinal mucosa and cause infections. Overactivation of adenylate cyclase can occur in Vibrio cholerae infections, dissemination via bloodstream suggests more severe infections such as sepsis, and flagella-mediated gut colonization occurs in infections such as Campylobacter jejuni."
