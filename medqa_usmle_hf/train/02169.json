The photograph of the leg shows lesions indicative of erythema nodosum, which is a skin manifestation associated with many conditions, including bacterial or viral infections. The combination of arthralgias and abdominal pain suggests a possible systemic inflammatory response. Hematuria may be present in conditions such as Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, which can present with similar symptoms as in this case. Therefore, hematuria is the most likely finding on further evaluation. Genital ulcers may be seen in conditions such as herpes simplex virus or syphilis, but there is no mention of such symptoms in the case. Tick bite is unlikely to be the cause of the symptoms in this case. Thrombocytopenia, which is a low platelet count, is a possible complication of some infections but is not the most likely finding in this case."

Abdominal pain and arthralgias are common symptoms of HSP, and the lesions are typically present on the arms and legs. HSP can lead to kidney involvement, which may manifest as hematuria.
