The patient's obesity, smoking history, and alcohol consumption put him at risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which can cause daytime fatigue and morning headaches. The high blood pressure also suggests a possible relationship to OSA. Weight loss is the best next step in management as it can improve OSA and lower the risk of other comorbidities associated with obesity. Alcohol avoidance in the evening may help with sleep, but is not the best next step in management. Caffeine avoidance may also help with sleep but is not likely to improve the patient's daytime fatigue. Screening for depression may be warranted, but weight loss is the best next step to address the patient's presenting complaints."

Option C may be considered, but it is less likely to be helpful without addressing the underlying sleep disorder."
