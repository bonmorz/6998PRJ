The most appropriate recommendation is to administer oral azithromycin to all family members and Tdap vaccination to the father and mother, as the mother\u2019s Tdap vaccination is more than 10 years ago and the baby is too young to receive the vaccine. Option C is also correct, but erythromycin can cause diarrhea, which may worsen the symptoms in this case. Option A is incorrect because the baby is too young to receive azithromycin."

Azithromycin is the first-line antibiotic for pertussis. Tdap vaccination should be given to both parents to prevent future pertussis infections.

Erythromycin can be used as an alternative but azithromycin is preferred due to fewer side effects and better compliance.

Option B includes all family members and uses the preferred antibiotic while also providing Tdap vaccination to both parents.
