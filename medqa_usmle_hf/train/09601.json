Option A is incorrect as repeated nerve stimulation will actually lead to fatigue and worsening of symptoms in myasthenia gravis.

A neoplasm of lung neuroendocrine cells is associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, which can also cause visual symptoms, but the presentation does not fit with this option."

Administering edrophonium leads to an improvement in her symptoms, which is characteristic of MG. Choice (A) is incorrect because an increasing response will not be seen on repeated nerve stimulation in patients with MG. Choice (C) is incorrect because it describes Small Cell Lung Cancer, which may harbor a paraneoplastic syndrome called Lambert-Eaton syndrome. Choice (D) is incorrect because it describes the pathophysiology of Lambert-Eaton syndrome, not MG. Therefore, the correct answer is (B), which describes the association of MG with thymic hyperplasia."
