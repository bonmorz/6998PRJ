Vitamin A is necessary for the normal healing of wounds and plays an important role in collagen metabolism. Vitamin C is necessary for collagen synthesis, and deficiencies can result in impaired wound healing. Zinc is also involved in wound healing and immune function, but deficiencies are rare in patients with adequate nutrition. While arginine plays a role in wound healing, supplementation has not been shown to improve wound healing or prevent wound failure. Therefore, the most appropriate supplement to prevent wound failure in this patient is Vitamin A."
