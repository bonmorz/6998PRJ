The fact that she didn't experience severe manic symptoms indicates type II bipolar disorder. Major depressive disorder can present similarly, but without the history of a hypomanic episode. Schizoaffective disorder involves both psychotic and mood symptoms, which are not present in this case. Bipolar disorder type I involves full manic episodes, which the patient did not experience."

The patient has symptoms of depression, but also exhibits previous symptoms of mania (easily distracted, 'brilliant ideas', decreased need for sleep). This suggests bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder type II is characterized by episodes of hypomania (less severe than full-blown mania) and major depression, which matches the patient's symptoms. Schizoaffective disorder usually involves symptoms of both psychosis and mood disorders, which are not present in this case, and bipolar disorder type I involves full-blown episodes of mania, which have not been reported by the patient."

The absence of psychotic symptoms rules out schizoaffective disorder, while the absence of a full manic episode rules out bipolar disorder type I.

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest bipolar disorder, as she had a manic episode a few months ago followed by a depressive episode now. However, since she did not have any psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions, schizoaffective disorder is not likely. The distinction between type I and type II bipolar disorder is based on the severity and duration of episodes, and the information provided is not sufficient to make that determination. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is bipolar disorder, type II."
