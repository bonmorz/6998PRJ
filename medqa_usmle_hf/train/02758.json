The patient has third-degree burns involving approximately 11% of TBSA, indicating that immediate surgical intervention is necessary to prevent complications such as infection and fluid loss. Early excision and split-thickness skin grafting are recommended for such cases. Delayed excision and skin grafting is not recommended for extensive third-degree burns as it increases the risk of infection and delays wound healing. Topical antibiotic application of mafenide acetate can be used to prevent infection but is not the most appropriate next step in management. Fluid resuscitation with Ringer\u2019s lactate solution per the Parkland formula is necessary for burns involving more than 15-20% TBSA, and therefore not the most appropriate for this patient."

Delayed excision may increase the risk of infection and fluid resuscitation with Ringer\u2019s solution should be started immediately but it\u2019s not the most appropriate next step in management.
