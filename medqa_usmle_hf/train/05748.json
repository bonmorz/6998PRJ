The symptoms of painless, blurry vision that worsened over time with halos around lights point towards hardening of the lens, which is a common age-related change known as cataracts. The absence of a red reflex further supports this diagnosis. Corneal edema can cause blurry vision, but it is typically associated with eye pain. Degeneration of the retina and optic nerve head damage can also cause vision problems, but they would present differently compared to cataracts."
