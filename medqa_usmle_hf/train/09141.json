The nailbed splinter hemorrhages and painful nodes on fingers and toes are consistent with infective endocarditis, which could be related to the patient's past history of congenital heart disease, but the specific details are unknown. Dental and genitourinary procedures as well as prosthetic heart valves are also risk factors for infective endocarditis, but they are less likely to be associated with S. gallolyticus as the causative organism."
