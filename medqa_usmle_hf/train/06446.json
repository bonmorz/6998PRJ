In iron-deficiency anemia, the serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation are low, while the total iron-binding capacity is high.

Option C, high serum iron and ferritin, would be seen in hemochromatosis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Option A, low serum iron but high ferritin, can be seen in inflammation or chronic disease but would not fully explain the patient's anemia.
