The question is asking for the enzyme involved in the penultimate step before ligation (joining) of Okazaki fragments can occur. The correct answer is DNA polymerase I, which is responsible for removing RNA primers and filling in gaps in the lagging strand during DNA replication. Once the gaps are filled, DNA ligase can then join the Okazaki fragments. DNA gyrase is involved in relieving torsional strain during DNA replication, DNA helicase unwinds the double helix, and DNA polymerase III is responsible for synthesizing new strands of DNA during replication."

The question asks about the enzyme involved in the penultimate (second to last) step before ligase joins the Okazaki fragments.

This gap-filling activity is the penultimate step before ligase joins the fragments, making (C) DNA polymerase I the correct answer. DNA gyrase and helicase are involved in unwinding the DNA strands for replication, while DNA polymerase III is responsible for synthesizing the new DNA strands."

During DNA replication, DNA polymerase III is responsible for adding nucleotides to the growing DNA strand in the 5' to 3' direction on both the leading and lagging strands. However, on the lagging strand, because replication occurs discontinuously, a shorter RNA primer is first synthesized by DNA primase, after which DNA polymerase III extends the fragment in the 5' to 3' direction. Lastly, DNA polymerase I removes the RNA primer and replaces it with DNA nucleotides, leaving a nick in the sugar-phosphate backbone. The final step before the nick can be sealed via ligation is the activity of DNA ligase, which can join the Okazaki fragments together. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) DNA polymerase I, which functions in the removal of RNA primers and filling in the gaps with DNA nucleotides before ligation."
