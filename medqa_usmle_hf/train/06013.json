The symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory evaluation suggest nephrotic syndrome, which is commonly associated with microcytic hypochromic anemia that responds poorly to oral iron therapy. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and acute renal failure are potential complications but are not as common in nephrotic syndrome. Prophylactic anticoagulation is not indicated in this case as there is no mention of any risk factors for thromboembolism."

Complications that may arise from nephrotic syndrome include infections due to immunoglobulin loss, thromboembolic events due to loss of antithrombin III, and microcytic hypochromic anemia due to iron deficiency. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis would not be caused by Haemophilus influenzae in this case, as it is more commonly associated with cirrhosis. Prophylactic anticoagulation is not indicated for this patient as there is no evidence of thromboembolism. Acute renal failure due to intrinsic renal failure is not a complication of nephrotic syndrome, but rather a potential cause of it."

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a complication of cirrhosis and not directly related to nephrotic syndrome. Anticoagulation is not indicated in this case. Acute renal failure due to intrinsic renal failure is also not likely since the ultrasound did not show any abnormality in the morphology of the kidneys."

The presence of periorbital edema, abdominal distention with a fluid thrill, and laboratory findings of proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia suggests nephrotic syndrome. Complications of nephrotic syndrome include thromboembolism, but prophylactic anticoagulation is not indicated in this case since there is no evidence of venous thrombosis. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a complication of cirrhosis and ascites, and intrinsic renal failure is a potential complication of acute kidney injury, but these do not seem to be the case in this patient. The laboratory findings also suggest that the patient may have microcytic hypochromic anemia, which may not respond well to oral iron therapy."

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (option A) is not commonly associated with nephrotic syndrome, and anticoagulation (option B) is not indicated in this scenario. Acute renal failure due to intrinsic renal failure (option C) is also a possibility in nephrotic syndrome, but is not as common as microcytic hypochromic anemia."
