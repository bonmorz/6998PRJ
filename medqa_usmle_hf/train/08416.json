Insulin therapy is indicated to lower blood glucose levels but should not be initiated until fluid replacement has begun. Potassium replacement may also be necessary, but it is not the best initial step in management. Therefore, option (C) normal saline and potassium is the best initial step in management for this patient."

The patient is presenting with symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is characterized by high blood glucose levels and metabolic acidosis. The initial step in management is to administer normal saline to restore fluid volume and correct electrolyte imbalances, including low potassium levels. Insulin therapy should follow fluid resuscitation. Therefore, option C is the best initial step in management. Option A is incorrect because potassium should not be administered until the patient has adequate urine output and normal or high serum potassium levels. Option B is incorrect because insulin therapy is necessary in addition to fluid resuscitation. Option D includes all necessary components of management, but potassium should not be administered until urine output is adequate and serum potassium levels are normal or high."
