The patient presents with vaginal bleeding, emesis, and a tender right suprapubic region, which suggests an ectopic pregnancy. A transvaginal ultrasound at this stage of pregnancy can help identify an intrauterine cystic mass, which is indicative of an ectopic pregnancy. Fetal parts would be more expected in a normal intrauterine pregnancy. Large intramural masses are not commonly seen in early pregnancy, and non-viable fetus would not present with a tender suprapubic region."
