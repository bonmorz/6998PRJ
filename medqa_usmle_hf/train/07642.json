The patient\u2019s blood pressure is poorly controlled despite being on multiple medications, indicating treatment-resistant hypertension. The increase in serum creatinine and the stenosis in the right renal artery suggest renal artery stenosis. Renal artery revascularization is the most appropriate next step in management. Enoxaparin and tissue plasminogen activator are used for venous thromboembolism and acute ischemic stroke, respectively, and are not indicated in this case. Maximizing the dose of antihypertensive medications is not likely to be effective in controlling blood pressure in the presence of renal artery stenosis."
