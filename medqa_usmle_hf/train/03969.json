Given the patient's symptoms, it is likely that the reversing agent administered was naloxone, which is used to treat opioid overdose. Naloxone works by blocking opioid receptors, therefore reversing the effects of opioids. While it is effective in reversing opioid overdose, it can also cause acute withdrawal symptoms, which can include agitation, nausea/vomiting, and tachycardia. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. Options (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect as naloxone works specifically on opioid receptors and is not effective on dopamine receptors, is a competitive inhibitor, and cannot be given per oral."

The patient's symptoms are consistent with opioid overdose, and the reversing agent most likely administered is naloxone.

However, because it can precipitate acute withdrawal, it is important for the patient to be monitored closely after administration. It works on opioid receptors, not dopamine receptors, and cannot be given per oral."
