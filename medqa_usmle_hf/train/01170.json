The patient may have developed an infection at the wound site, indicated by the fever, high leukocyte count, and purulent discharge. The most appropriate initial pharmacological treatment for this patient would be Vancomycin and cefepime, as they cover a broad range of bacterial pathogens commonly found in hospital-acquired infections. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone do not cover as broad a range, while Piperacillin/tazobactam and cefepime are both broad-spectrum antibiotics and may not be necessary as initial treatment. Vancomycin and metronidazole are given for Clostridioides difficiles infections and would not be the best initial treatment for this patient."
