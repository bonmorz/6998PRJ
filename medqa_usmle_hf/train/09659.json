Teniposide is a type of chemotherapy that works by inhibiting topoisomerase II, which causes double-stranded DNA breaks and interferes with DNA synthesis and cell replication. This mechanism of action is best represented by option (B). Decrease in nucleotide synthesis is the mechanism of action of antimetabolites like methotrexate, inhibition of thymidylate synthase is the mechanism of action of fluorouracil, and inhibition of topoisomerase I is the mechanism of action of irinotecan."

This mechanism of action is most effective against fast-growing cancer cells like those seen in acute lymphoblastic leukemia."
