The patient's symptoms, laboratory values, and history (including recent move to Denver) suggest high altitude sickness. The low arterial oxygen tension and high respiratory exchange ratio suggest the patient is compensating for hypoxia through hyperventilation. None of the other options are consistent with the values presented. Hypoventilation would result in increased CO2, which is not the case here. Pulmonary fibrosis would lead to decreased lung function and decreased oxygenation, but the CO2 levels would not be elevated as in this case. V/Q mismatch would lead to decreased oxygenation, but the CO2 levels should not be elevated, as in this case."

The low arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) and high respiratory exchange ratio (RER) suggest hypoxemia and increased CO2 production, respectively. However, the oxygen tension in inspired air is normal, ruling out a problem with the air itself. The arterial oxygen tension also indicates a V/Q mismatch, but the tidal volume and respiratory rate suggest adequate ventilation. The patient\u2019s history of recent move to Denver and the laboratory values are consistent with high altitude, which causes hypoxemia due to decreased inspired oxygen partial pressure at higher altitude. Thus, the correct answer is (A) High altitude."

The laboratory values suggest that the patient is experiencing hypoxia, but the arterial oxygen tension is not significantly low enough to indicate a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, hypoventilation or pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, the most likely cause is high altitude, as Denver is located at a high altitude and has lower atmospheric pressure, which leads to lower oxygen tension in inspired air."
