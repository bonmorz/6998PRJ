This patient is presenting signs and symptoms of a fetal demise, and her blood work shows thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. The best immediate course of management for this patient is to administer IV fluids to treat hypovolemia and prepare for delivery. D-dimer assay is used to diagnose deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Fresh frozen plasma is used to correct coagulopathy, but it is not the immediate course of management for this patient. Low-molecular-weight heparin is contraindicated in the setting of thrombocytopenia."
