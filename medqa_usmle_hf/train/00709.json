The patient presents with symptoms of nausea and vomiting, with electrolyte imbalances suggesting hypokalemia, and a history of marijuana use. Hypokalemia is a common side effect of marijuana use. The treatment for hypokalemia is administration of isotonic saline with potassium. Therefore, the next best step in management would be to administer ondansetron and isotonic saline with potassium. Option A, to obtain an urine toxin screen, is a viable option but it is not urgent and does not address the patient's immediate symptoms. Option B, to administer ondansetron per oral and provide oral rehydration solution, may not be effective because the patient is having multiple bouts of emesis and is at risk for dehydration. Option D, to administer ondansetron and 1/2 normal saline with dextrose, does not address the patient's hypokalemia."

Option (A) may not change management as the history indicates the cause of symptoms. Option (B) may not be effective as the patient continues to have emesis.
