Over-repletion of the serum abnormality may lead to bradycardia, but the immediate concern is to lower the potassium level to prevent further complications."

The symptoms described in the case suggest that the patient is experiencing a electrolyte imbalance, specifically hyperkalemia, which can lead to an irregular heart rhythm and muscle contractions. Treatment for this condition involves decreasing the serum potassium levels, which can lead to hypokalemia and bradycardia as a result of over-repletion. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. Option (B) is not related to electrolyte imbalances, and options (C) and (D) are not associated with hypokalemia."

This can lead to an irregular heartbeat, or arrhythmia, which can present as varying QT amplitudes, chest palpitations, and muscle contractions. Tapping of the cheek is a test for facial nerve function and is not related to hyperkalemia. Over-repletion of the serum abnormality (in this case, hyperkalemia) can lead to bradycardia, or a slow heartbeat, which is another potential complication of hyperkalemia. Diffused calcifications and kidney stones are not directly related to hyperkalemia. Seizures may be a symptom of severe hyperkalemia but are less common than arrhythmias and bradycardia."
