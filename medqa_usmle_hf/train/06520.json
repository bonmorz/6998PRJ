The question is asking for a drug that has a similar mechanism of action to the experimental drug, which irreversibly binds DPP-IV with a higher affinity than GLP1. Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which also increases levels of GLP1 by slowing its degradation, but it does not bind to GLP1 receptors directly. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the new experimental drug is similar to Sitagliptin. Pramlintide is an amylin analog, Canagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor, and Metformin is a biguanide, so they all have different mechanisms of action."

DPP-IV inhibitors that improve glucose regulation by increasing GLP1 availability are Sitagliptin, Saxagliptin, Linagliptin, and Alogliptin. Therefore, the drug with a similar mechanism of action to the new experimental drug is Sitagliptin. Pramlintide is an analog of Amylin, which slows gastric emptying and decreases glucagon secretion, while Canagliflozin inhibits SGLT2, leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine. Metformin improves glucose regulation by suppressing gluconeogenesis and increasing insulin sensitivity."

Metformin works by decreasing glucose production in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity in muscle tissue.
