The visible and palpable groin protrusion above the inguinal ligament on the right side with bulging during Valsalva maneuver are classic signs of an indirect inguinal hernia. Lipomas are typically not palpable during Valsalva maneuver and do not cause pain. Inguinal lymphadenopathy would not cause a visible and palpable protrusion. Strangulated hernia is a medical emergency and would present with severe pain, nausea, and vomiting."

Strangulated hernia presents with severe pain, fever, and an obstruction of bowel movements, which are not seen in this patient."
