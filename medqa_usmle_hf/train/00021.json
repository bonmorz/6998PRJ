The question mentions that persistent photostimulation causes inhibition of action potential generation in the lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus. The lateral hypothalamus is known to be involved in regulating feeding behavior, and inhibition of this nucleus is likely to lead to anorexia or decreased appetite. Hypothermia or polydipsia (increased thirst) are not likely to be directly affected by this manipulation. Hyperthermia may be a potential side effect of prolonged photostimulation due to the animal\u2019s inability to regulate body temperature."
