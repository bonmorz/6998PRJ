The patient had a history of gastric ulcer and received a transfusion of packed red blood cells, which suggests that the most likely cause of the patient's condition is an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. The symptoms of chills, lumbar pain, and oliguria are typical of this reaction, along with the vital sign changes of increased pulse and decreased blood pressure. Anaphylactic transfusion reaction would show symptoms of hives and bronchospasm. Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction causes only fever and rigors. Transfusion-related acute lung injury would show symptoms of respiratory distress and hypoxemia."

The symptoms of chills, pain in the lumbar region, and oliguria suggest acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, which can occur due to ABO incompatibility or other factors that cause destruction of red blood cells. The patient develops a fever and a decrease in blood pressure, which are also common symptoms of acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. Anaphylactic transfusion reaction is characterized by symptoms such as hypotension, bronchospasm, or urticaria. Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction presents with fever, rigors, or chills, but usually occurs during or shortly after a transfusion. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) presents with acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia, and usually occurs during or within 6 hours of a transfusion."

The symptoms suggest acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, which is a systemic reaction characterized by fever, chills, lumbar pain, and oliguria. The drop in blood pressure can be caused by the release of substances from the red blood cells, which can cause vasodilation and increased capillary permeability. Anaphylactic reaction usually involves skin itching, urticaria, and respiratory distress. Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction is characterized by fever and chills but without hemolysis. Transfusion-related acute lung injury involves respiratory distress without fever and chills."
