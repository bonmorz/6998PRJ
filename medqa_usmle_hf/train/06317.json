The control event rate is the number of patients who developed diabetic nephropathy on the sulfonylurea, which is 134/1000 or 13.4%. The experimental event rate is the number of patients who developed diabetic nephropathy on the DPP-4 inhibitor, which is 68/1000 or 6.8%. Therefore, RRR = (13.4% - 6.8%)/13.4% x 100% = 49%. Therefore, the answer is (C), which indicates that using the DPP-4 inhibitor reduced the risk of developing diabetic nephropathy by 49% compared to the sulfonylurea."
