Option (B) corresponds to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and option (C) corresponds to membranous nephropathy, both of which are less likely based on the patient\u2019s lab results. Option (D) corresponds to amyloidosis, which is less likely given the absence of other suggestive findings."
