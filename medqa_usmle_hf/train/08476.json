The clinical suspicion for this patient is renal tubular acidosis, specifically Type 1 which is characterized by hypokalemia, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and failure to thrive. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, works in the loop of Henle in the kidney to inhibit sodium-potassium-chloride transport, leading to the excretion of sodium, potassium, and chloride. While it does not have the same mechanism of action as renal tubular acidosis, it is commonly used to treat the metabolic abnormalities associated with it."

The patient likely has Bartter syndrome, which is a renal tubular disorder that causes abnormalities in electrolyte balance. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that functions by inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions in the ascending loop of Henle. Bartter syndrome is caused by genetic mutations in ion channels and transporters in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, resulting in similar electrolyte imbalances. Therefore, Furosemide has the most similar mechanism of action as the underlying pathophysiology of Bartter syndrome."
