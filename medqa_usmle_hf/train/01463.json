The anterior pituitary secretes several hormones, including prolactin, oxytocin, antidiuretic hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Bitemporal hemianopsia is a common finding in patients with pituitary adenomas, and excess TSH can cause an adenoma to form. Additionally, TSH is known to uptake a basophilic stain. Therefore, the most likely hormone detected in the patient's blood is TSH."

Basophilic stains are commonly used to identify thyroid cells, and TSH is the hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland. Adenomas that produce excess TSH are rare, but they can occur and cause symptoms such as headaches and visual field defects."
