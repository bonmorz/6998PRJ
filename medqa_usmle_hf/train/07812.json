Among the options, only trazodone, which is used to treat depression and insomnia, has priapism listed as a potential side effect. Sickle cell disease can also cause priapism, but it is not mentioned in the patient's history. The history of traveling to Mexico does not suggest a likely cause for priapism. Therefore, depression treatment with trazodone is the most likely precipitating factor for priapism in this patient."
