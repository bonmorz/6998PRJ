Azithromycin can cause depletion of intestinal flora, which can affect the metabolism of warfarin and lead to an increase in INR. Option B is incorrect because azithromycin does not inhibit cytochrome p450, which is responsible for metabolizing warfarin. Option C is incorrect because an increase in non-protein bound warfarin fraction would actually decrease the INR. Option D is incorrect because there are no symptoms or signs of hepatotoxicity mentioned in the question."

Azithromycin can cause depletion of intestinal flora which can lead to decreased vitamin K production and subsequently decrease the liver's ability to produce clotting factors. This can result in an increase in the patient's INR level. Inhibition of cytochrome p450 can also affect warfarin metabolism, but this is not the most likely explanation in this case. Increased non-protein bound warfarin fraction or drug-induced hepatotoxicity are less likely causes of the mild increase in INR."
