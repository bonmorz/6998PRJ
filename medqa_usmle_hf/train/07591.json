The gram-negative, oxidase-positive, comma-shaped bacteria that grows well in a pH > 8 is Vibrio cholerae, which produces a toxin that overactivates adenylate cyclase, leading to severe watery diarrhea. The mechanism of action is via ADP-ribosylation of the Gs subunit, which stimulates the production of cyclic AMP leading to electrolyte and water secretion into the gut lumen. Option B is incorrect as it inhibits Gi subunit leading to increased activity of adenylate cyclase. Option C describes the mechanism of action of ricin, while option D describes the toxin produced by Escherichia coli, which causes traveler's diarrhea."
