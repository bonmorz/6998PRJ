Injury to the inferior vena cava may cause blood loss but not necessarily low blood pressure. Injury to the left main coronary artery may cause myocardial infarction but would not result in low blood pressure."

A hand-sized hematoma on the anterior chest wall may also indicate an underlying injury to the aorta. An ECG showing sinus tachycardia is a common finding in traumatic aortic injury; however, it is not specific to this condition.
