Hematogenous spread of bacteria can cause infective endocarditis, but the symptoms are different from those of mitral stenosis.

Hematogenous spread of bacteria can cause infective endocarditis, which can also present with a murmur but is less likely given the patient's symptoms. Congenital valvular defects are possible, but the presentation of symptoms at 38 years of age makes this less likely."
