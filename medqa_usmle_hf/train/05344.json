The fact that the histology reveals gastric tissue suggests that the cystic mass is a Meckel\u2019s diverticulum, resulting from the abnormal closure of the vitelline duct. This can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, and bleeding. The other options may also cause similar symptoms, but are not associated with the presence of gastric tissue in the histology."

Obstruction of the lumen of the appendix by a fecalith may cause appendicitis, twisting of the midgut secondary to malrotation may cause volvulus, and ingestion of contaminated water may cause infectious diarrhea, but none of these answer choices explain the patient's symptoms and findings as well as Meckel's diverticulum."

Meckel's diverticulum is caused by abnormal closure of the vitelline duct during fetal development. It can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, and dark red stools, and can be seen on CT scan as a cystic mass in the ileum. Option (A) is a potential cause of appendicitis. Option (C) is a potential cause of midgut volvulus, but this condition usually presents earlier in life. Option (D) is a potential cause of infectious diarrhea, but does not explain the specific findings in this case."

The presence of gastric tissue in the cystic mass suggests an abnormal closure of the vitelline duct, which connects the embryo's developing digestive system to the yolk sac. This can lead to the formation of Meckel's diverticulum, which can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, and dark red stools. Option A describes appendicitis, which typically presents with right lower quadrant pain and is not associated with the presence of gastric tissue. Option C describes midgut volvulus, which presents with bilious vomiting and is also not associated with the presence of gastric tissue. Option D is too generalized and not specific to the symptoms and findings described in the question."

The presence of gastric tissue in the ileum suggests the presence of a Meckel's diverticulum, which is a remnant of the vitelline duct. When this duct fails to close during embryonic development, it can result in the development of ectopic gastric tissue. This type of diverticulum can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, and rectal bleeding. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. Option (A) refers to appendicitis, which is not the correct diagnosis in this case. Option (C) refers to malrotation of the midgut, which can lead to volvulus or intestinal obstruction, but this is not the correct diagnosis in this case. Option (D) is not related to the patient\u2019s symptoms."
