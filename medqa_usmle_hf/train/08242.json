D-dimer is a laboratory marker of DIC and its elevated levels are characteristic of this complication.

The patient is presenting with signs of placental abruption and has severe bleeding with blood clots passing through the cervix.

These are all indicative of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a complication that can occur with severe placental abruption. Elevated levels of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product, are characteristic of DIC. Therefore, the correct answer is (D)."

The patient's presentation is consistent with placental abruption, which can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The laboratory findings, such as the low platelet count, prolonged PT and PTT, and low fibrinogen level, suggest DIC. D-dimer is a laboratory marker that reflects fibrin degradation and is elevated in DIC. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) D-dimer. Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein are markers of inflammation and infection and are not specific to DIC.

The patient's symptoms suggest the presence of placental abruption, which is a life-threatening complication during pregnancy. The laboratory findings indicate severe coagulopathy, as evidenced by the markedly elevated prothrombin time, partial prothrombin time, and low serum fibrinogen. The elevated D-dimer level indicates the presence of ongoing fibrinolysis due to the formation and breakdown of clots, which is common in cases of placental abruption. Option (D) is therefore the correct answer. Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein are markers of infection and inflammation, respectively, and are not typically elevated in cases of placental abruption. Creatinine is a measure of kidney function and is not directly related to this patient's complication."
