Basilar crackles on pulmonary auscultation is a common finding in left-sided heart failure due to fluid accumulation in the lungs. Increased ejection fraction would be more likely to be seen in right-sided heart failure, as it suggests the heart is able to pump out more blood than usual. Hepatojugular reflex and abdominal fullness are not typically associated with either type of heart failure."
