The patient's height and weight, along with the presence of facial hair and acne, suggest an underlying hormonal abnormality. The presence of a testicular mass further supports this possibility. Among the options, a Leydig cell tumor is the most likely cause of these symptoms. Normal development in obesity would not explain the testicular mass and hormonal changes. Pituitary adenoma and precocious puberty are also possible causes of these symptoms but are less likely given the patient's age and presentation."

Normal development in the setting of obesity and pituitary adenoma are less likely to cause the symptoms seen in this patient. Precocious puberty can cause early and rapid sexual development, but a testicular mass is not a common feature of precocious puberty."
