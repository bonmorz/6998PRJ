Systemic mastocytosis can also cause flushing and wheezing but does not typically lead to right ventricular dysfunction. Whipple\u2019s disease and Irritable bowel syndrome are not associated with these symptoms."

Whipple\u2019s disease is very rare and presents with diarrhea and malabsorption, but not typical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome.

The combination of loose stools, palpitations, and non-pitting edema suggests carcinoid syndrome, which is caused by carcinoid tumors.

The CT scans show masses in the small intestine and liver, which can be indicative of carcinoid tumors. Systemic mastocytosis would have mast cell infiltration and Whipple's disease would have malabsorption, neither of which are noted in this patient.
