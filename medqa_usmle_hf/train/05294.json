The patient\u2019s symptoms and lab results suggest Graves\u2019 disease, an autoimmune disorder where antibodies stimulate the TSH receptor in the thyroid gland, causing hyperthyroidism. Retroorbital fibroblasts are stimulated by these antibodies, leading to the characteristic eye symptoms of Graves\u2019 disease, such as discomfort in the heat and eye bulging. Hyperplasia of thyroid follicular cells and lymphocyte-mediated destruction are processes seen in other thyroid disorders, such as goiter and Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, respectively. Elevated cholesterol and LDL levels can be seen in hypothyroidism."
