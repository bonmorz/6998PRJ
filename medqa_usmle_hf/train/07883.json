The coronary steal phenomenon occurs when there is excessive dilation of microvessels in non-ischemic areas of the myocardium, leading to diversion of blood from ischemic areas and worsening of ischemia. Options A and C are not correct because venodilation and arterial dilation do not directly affect blood flow in the coronary vessels. Option D is not correct because volume loss of fluid in the periphery does not affect blood flow in the coronary vessels either."

The coronary steal phenomenon occurs when a dilating agent such as adenosine, causes selective dilation of the normal vessels rather than stenotic vessels, leading to blood being shunted away from the ischemic areas. This is due to the dilation of the microvessels in normal tissue, which diverts blood away from the areas with stenosis leading to a paradoxical decrease of blood flow in the ischemic area. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) microvessel dilation."
