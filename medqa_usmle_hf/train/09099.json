The failure to thrive and developmental delay are common symptoms, as well as the history of cataracts. Elevated levels of methionine and homocysteine in the urine support this diagnosis. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is characterized by decreased phenylalanine hydroxylase activity, leading to increased phenylalanine levels, but does not fit with the symptoms described. Deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase causes alkaptonuria, with symptoms such as dark urine and joint pain. Inability to degrade branched chain amino acids leads to maple syrup urine disease, which manifests with severe neurological symptoms in infants. None of these conditions fit with the symptoms described in the case."
