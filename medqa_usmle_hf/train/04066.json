The presence of slowly draining yellow pus-like fluid suggests an infection, and the yellow granules suggest a granulomatous reaction. The most common cause of granulomatous infections of the skin is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which are acid-fast rods. However, the patient's recent opioid overdose and oral exam findings point more towards a suppressed immune system, which makes the patient more susceptible to Gram-positive bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus, which is a Gram-positive rod. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's facial lumps is a bacterial infection, likely caused by Staphylococcus aureus."
