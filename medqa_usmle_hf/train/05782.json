The best way to obtain a more in-depth social history is to ask the mother to step outside into the hall for a portion of the visit, which allows the physician to establish trust and confidentiality with the adolescent patient. Asking the questions directly in front of the mother may limit the patient's willingness to disclose sensitive information. Speaking softly to the patient in the presence of the mother may not provide adequate confidentiality, and disallowing the mother to be present during the entire visit may not be practical or necessary."

The best approach would be to ask the mother to step outside into the hall for a portion of the visit. This allows for the patient to feel more comfortable and open in discussing their social history, sexual activity, and substance use. It's important to respect patient privacy and provide a safe space for open communication. Asking the questions directly in front of the mother may make the patient feel uncomfortable and hinder their ability to disclose important information. Speaking softly to the patient may also not be effective if the mother is still in the room, as she may still be able to hear the conversation. Disallowing the mother to be present in the examination room may also not be practical or necessary, as long as she is willing to step out for a portion of the visit."

The physician can ask the patient if she feels comfortable discussing these topics with her mother in the room, and then ask the mother to step out temporarily while the questions are asked. It is important to ensure that the patient feels comfortable and supported, while still maintaining appropriate boundaries and confidentiality. Option (A) may make the patient uncomfortable or inhibited, and option (C) may not be appropriate if the mother can still hear. Option (D) is not necessary and could potentially harm the patient's relationship with her mother."
