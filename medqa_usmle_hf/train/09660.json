Based on the patient\u2019s symptoms, including cognitive decline and hallucinations, and neurological exam findings, such as cogwheel rigidity, the most likely diagnosis is Parkinson's disease with Lewy body dementia. The additional radiological investigation that would be most likely seen is decreased perfusion and dopaminergic activity in occipital lobes on PET, as it is a characteristic feature of Lewy body dementia. MRI is not typically used to diagnose Lewy body dementia, but if performed, may show generalized cerebral and cerebellar atrophy rather than multiple lacunar infarcts or pontine 'hot-cross bun' sign. SPECT may show hypoperfusion and hypometabolism in frontal lobes, but it is less specific for Lewy body dementia than PET."
