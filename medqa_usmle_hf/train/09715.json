The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest vitamin D deficiency, which can lead to demineralization of bones and muscle weakness. The low serum calcium levels also suggest vitamin D deficiency, as vitamin D is crucial for calcium absorption. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. High serum 25-OH D levels with high PTH levels can occur in hyperparathyroidism, while low alkaline phosphatase levels with low serum PTH levels can occur in hypoparathyroidism. High serum 25-OH D with high phosphate levels can occur in conditions such as renal failure or hypoparathyroidism."

The patient's symptoms, including numbness, tingling, and muscle pain, along with the demineralization seen on X-ray, suggest that he may have vitamin D deficiency. This is further supported by his indoor lifestyle and lack of vitamin supplementation. Low serum 25-OH D with low serum calcium levels is indicative of vitamin D deficiency. High serum 25-OH D levels with high serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels would suggest that the patient has hypervitaminosis D, which is not consistent with his symptoms. Low alkaline phosphatase levels with low serum PTH levels could occur in a range of conditions, but would not fully explain the patient's symptoms. High serum 25-OH D with high phosphate levels would suggest that the patient has chronic kidney disease, which is not consistent with his presentation."
