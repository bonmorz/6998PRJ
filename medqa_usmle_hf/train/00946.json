The patient's symptoms and presentation are consistent with a gastric ulcer, and the biopsy revealing H. pylori infection implicates bacterial infection as the cause. Chronic NSAID use is a well-known risk factor for gastric ulcers, while longstanding GERD may increase the risk of developing esophageal ulcers. Age and gender may be general risk factors for developing ulcers, but chronic NSAID use is a more specific and significant risk factor in this case. A congenital diverticulum would not predispose the patient to a gastric ulcer."
