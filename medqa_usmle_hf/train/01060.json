Doppler color ultrasound and soft tissue ultrasound may be used to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis, but the absence of pain or sensitivity changes makes it less likely. T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone assessment may be useful to evaluate for thyroid dysfunction, but it is less likely given the absence of an enlarged thyroid gland."
