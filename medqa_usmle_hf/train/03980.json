In Graves\u2019 disease, there is overproduction of thyroid hormones, which will suppress TSH production. Therefore, TSH is most likely low in this patient. Calcitonin is produced by the thyroid gland, but it is not likely to be involved in this patient\u2019s symptoms. T3 and T4 are thyroid hormones, but they are elevated in hyperthyroidism, not low."

TSH levels will be low in hyperthyroidism, as the thyroid gland is overproducing thyroid hormones, leading to negative feedback on the pituitary gland and decreased production of TSH. Calcitonin is produced by the C-cells of the thyroid gland and is involved in calcium homeostasis. T3 and T4 are both thyroid hormones, but TSH is a better choice as it is specifically related to thyroid gland function."
