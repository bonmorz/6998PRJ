Alpha-1-adrenergic receptor antagonists are commonly used to treat BPH by relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck. However, they can also cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope by dilating blood vessels and decreasing blood pressure, particularly upon standing. Therefore, option (A) is the most likely mechanism of action for the medication in question. Options (B) and (C) are also commonly used to treat BPH, but do not cause orthostatic hypotension. Option (D) is not a medication used for BPH."
