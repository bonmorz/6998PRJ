The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality for carvedilol versus metoprolol was 0.83. To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) to save one life, we use the formula: NNT = 1/(risk reduction). The risk reduction is the difference in mortality rates between the two treatment groups, divided by the mortality rate of the control group (metoprolol): (0.40 - 0.34)/0.40 = 0.15. Therefore, NNT = 1/0.15 = 6.67, which can be rounded up to 7. So, seven patients need to be treated with carvedilol instead of metoprolol to save one life. The correct answer is (A)."
