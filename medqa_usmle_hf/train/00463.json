The characteristics of the headache, such as the excruciating, stabbing pain around one side of the head, tearing of the eye, and occurring in clusters, suggest that the patient has cluster headache. Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and SUNCT syndrome are also types of headache with similar characteristics, but they differ in duration and frequency. Trigeminal neuralgia is also a type of headache, but it is characterized by brief electric shock-like pain in one side of the face."

Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headaches with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) syndrome presents with similar symptoms but also has additional symptoms like redness in the eye and drooping of the eyelid.

The symptoms described suggest cluster headache, which is characterized by intense, stabbing pain on one side of the head, along with tearing of the eyes and nasal congestion. The headache typically lasts for 15 minutes to 3 hours and can happen multiple times throughout the day. Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headaches with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) syndrome are similar conditions but have different patterns and characteristics.

Cluster headaches occur daily or nearly every day and typically last for 30-90 minutes. They are characterized by severe unilateral pain around the eye and temple, sweating, flushing, and nasal congestion. The tearing of the left eye reported by the patient is also a common symptom of cluster headaches. Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) is similar to cluster headaches but occurs more frequently and for shorter durations. Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headaches with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) syndrome is another type of headache that presents with similar symptoms but is even more severe and lasts for shorter durations. Trigeminal neuralgia typically presents with sudden, severe facial pain that lasts for seconds to several minutes and may recur multiple times a day."
