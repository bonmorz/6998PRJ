Repeat serum \u03b2-hCG and pelvic ultrasound in 2 days would delay the treatment of a potentially life-threatening condition. Oral misoprostol is not indicated for ectopic pregnancy."

Option (C) delays treatment and monitoring for 2 days may put the patient at risk. Option (D) is not a standard treatment for ectopic pregnancy."

The patient likely has an ectopic pregnancy, as evidenced by the combination of lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and an elevated serum \u03b2-hCG level. The fact that the ultrasound did not show a gestational sac is further suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy. Administration of anti-D immunoglobulin is recommended due to the patient's RhD negative blood type, as there is a risk of Rh isoimmunization if any fetal blood enters the maternal circulation. Intramuscular methotrexate is the standard therapy for unruptured tubal pregnancies, and is given after confirmation of an ectopic pregnancy via ultrasound and quantitative serum \u03b2-hCG measurements to ensure that the pregnancy is not viable."
