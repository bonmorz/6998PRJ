The patient's family history of wheat allergy and lactose intolerance are not associated with Crohn's disease, and celiac disease typically presents with malabsorption and weight loss, which are not mentioned as symptoms in this case. Irritable bowel syndrome does not typically present with mucosal lesions or perirectal abscesses, and would not explain the presence of blood in the patient's diarrhea."

The patient\u2019s symptoms of chronic abdominal discomfort and cramping with diarrhea mixed with blood, along with a family history of wheat allergy and frequent attempts to induce vomiting to lose weight, suggest that the most likely diagnosis is Crohn\u2019s disease. The presence of a perirectal abscess and colonoscopy findings of scattered mucosal lesions in the colon and terminal ileum support this diagnosis. The complete blood count shows a low Hb%, elevated WBC count with neutrophilia, and a slightly elevated ESR, which are consistent with an inflammatory condition like Crohn\u2019s disease.

The symptoms of chronic abdominal discomfort, cramping, and diarrhea mixed with blood suggests inflammatory bowel disease. The scattered mucosal lesions found in the colon and terminal ileum also support Crohn\u2019s disease, which can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. The perirectal abscess and elevated WBC count also suggest an inflammatory process. Irritable bowel syndrome does not involve mucosal inflammation or rectal abscesses. Celiac disease is associated with autoimmune reactions against gluten, but not with rectal abscesses or inflammatory bowel disease. Ulcerative colitis primarily affects the colon and typically presents with continuous lesions rather than scattered ones."
