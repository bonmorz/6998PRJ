As lateral gaze of the left eye is limited, it could indicate intracranial pressure. MRI of the brain can help confirm a diagnosis and determine the severity of the condition. Intravenous antibiotics may also be indicated, but they should be chosen based on the specific causative organism, which is unknown at this time. Cranial burr hole evacuation would not be appropriate without further diagnostic evaluation."
