The decreased RPF, combined with the decrease in GFR, results in an increased filtration fraction. Therefore, the answer is (B): decreased GFR, decreased RPF, increased FF."

This will cause a decrease in blood volume, triggering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to contract blood vessels and increase sodium and water reabsorption, ultimately leading to a decrease in GFR and RPF. However, FF will increase due to the decreased RPF relative to the decreased GFR. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Decreased GFR, decreased RPF, increased FF."
