The patient's symptoms and previous history suggest acute cholecystitis, which is confirmed by the severe right upper quadrant tenderness. Due to her surgical unfit status, the next course of action would be to manage the symptoms and attempt to dissolve any gallstones with hydrophilic bile acids. No further treatment may increase the risk of complications, while stronger analgesics such as morphine may exacerbate the risk of bleeding. Waiting and re-evaluating after a few hours may also increase the risk of complications, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not feasible due to her high risk of bleeding.  Therefore, hydrophilic bile acids would be the next best step in the management of this patient."
