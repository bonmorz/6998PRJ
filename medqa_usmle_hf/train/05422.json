The patient reports a history of practicing anal intercourse, which suggests acute anal fissure (C) as the most likely diagnosis. The increased sphincter tone and severe pain during examination support this diagnosis. Deterioration of connective tissue (A) is a possible cause of hemorrhoids, but the symptoms described by the patient do not point in that direction. Rectal prolapse (B) and paradoxical contraction of the puborectalis muscle is unlikely because the patient does not complain of rectal prolapse or difficulty with defecation. Inflammatory bowel disease (D) would typically present with more systemic symptoms, such as diarrhea, weight loss or fever."
