The color of the aspirated fluid, yellowish-green, is most likely due to the presence of myeloperoxidase, an enzyme found in white blood cells. This suggests the presence of an abscess, which is confirmed by the ultrasound finding of a fluid-filled cavity in the liver. Gram-negative, lactose-fermenting rods are consistent with a bacterial infection, most likely enteric organisms that have spread to the liver from the gastrointestinal tract. Prodigiosin and staphyloxanthin are pigments produced by certain bacteria but are not associated with the clinical presentation in this case. Biliverdin is a breakdown product of hemoglobin and not likely to be present in the aspirated fluid."
