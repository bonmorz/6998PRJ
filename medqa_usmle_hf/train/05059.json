The location of the pain and the fact that it is worse when pressure is applied to the sole of the foot between the metatarsal heads suggests that the most likely diagnosis is Intermetatarsal neuroma. The audible click and pain shooting into the third and fourth digits are also typical signs of this condition. Stress fractures are usually more focal and do not involve multiple metatarsals, while osteochondrosis is more common in younger patients and is typically asymptomatic. Osteomyelitis would show signs of inflammation and infection, which are not present in this case."

The history of wearing high heels also increases the risk of developing this condition. Third metatarsal stress fracture and osteomyelitis would show different symptoms and signs.
