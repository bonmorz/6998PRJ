The correlation analysis shows a positive correlation between maternal BMI and childhood BMI, indicating that as maternal BMI increases, so does childhood BMI. This suggests that maternal BMI is a predictor of childhood obesity. The correlation between maternal HbA1c and childhood BMI is not shown to be stronger or weaker than the correlation between maternal BMI and childhood BMI, so answer choice (A) is incorrect. The correlation analysis does not show that higher maternal HbA1c leads to increased childhood BMI, so answer choice (B) is incorrect. The slope of the association between maternal BMI and childhood BMI is not compared to the slope of the association between maternal HbA1c and childhood BMI, so answer choice (C) is incorrect."
