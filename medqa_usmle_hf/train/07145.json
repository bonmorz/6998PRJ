The fact that the patient feels confused and lethargic after the episodes suggests complex partial seizure. The vague muddy taste in her mouth prior to the onset of these symptoms is a common seizure aura. Atonic seizures are characterized by sudden loss of muscle tone, while generalized tonic-clonic seizures involve loss of consciousness and full body convulsions. Breath-holding spells are common in toddlers and are characterized by involuntary holding of breath and temporarily stopping breathing, but they do not involve seizures."
