The infant's presentation is consistent with a brachial plexus injury, specifically affecting the C5 and C6 nerve roots. The left arm's adduction and internal rotation at the shoulder and extension at the elbow suggest involvement of the musculocutaneous nerve, which arises from C5 and C6 nerve roots. The right upper extremity's normal strength and range of motion in all planes suggest that the injury is not affecting the suprascapular nerve, which arises from C5 and C6 nerve roots and innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. Therefore, the most likely option is (A) C5 and C6 nerve roots."

The fact that wrist flexion and extension are intact suggests that the musculocutaneous nerve is not affected. The suprascapular nerve only innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, which would not be affected in Erb-Duchenne palsy."
