Treatment usually involves hydration, pain management, and antiemetics. Hydrocodone and indomethacin can help manage pain in this situation. Emergency percutaneous nephrostomy would be indicated if there was complete obstruction of the urinary tract or if there was infected hydronephrosis. 24-hour urine chemistry would be more appropriate for managing asymptomatic nephrolithiasis or recurrent stones. Lithotripsy could be a treatment option for larger stones, but not for the 4-mm-diameter stone in this case."

Emergency percutaneous nephrostomy is not necessary at this time as the patient is still urinating normally. 24-hour urine chemistry can be ordered after the acute episode is resolved to identify potential causes for the nephrolithiasis. Lithotripsy may be considered for larger stones, but a 4mm-diameter stone can usually pass spontaneously with conservative management."
