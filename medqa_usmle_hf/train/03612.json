The patient's history and symptoms suggest infective endocarditis, which can cause a murmur and echocardiographic abnormalities. Among the options, perivalvular thickening with an echolucent cavity is the most likely finding in infective endocarditis. A highly echogenic, thin, linear structure in the right atrium suggests a thrombus. A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is used to diagnose endocarditis and detect complications such as abscesses and valvular damage."

The high-pitched decrescendo early diastolic murmur indicates aortic regurgitation, which can be seen in endocarditis. The most likely finding on TEE in this case would be perivalvular thickening with an echolucent cavity, which is an indication of valvular vegetation. Options A, B, and D are less likely to be seen in this case."
