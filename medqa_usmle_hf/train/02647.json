The recent upper respiratory infection and destruction of sensory nerve cell bodies suggest that the dorsal root ganglion has been damaged. Meissner's corpuscles are sensitive to light touch, not fine touch, and are located in the dermis of the skin. Ventral root ganglion is responsible for motor functions, not sensory.

The loss of sensation in a specific dermatome pattern indicates damage to the dorsal root ganglion, where sensory nerves enter the spinal cord. The destruction of cell bodies of sensory nerves suggests a viral infection, like herpes virus, which can specifically target and damage the dorsal root ganglion. Meissner's corpuscles are responsible for detecting changes in texture and are located in the skin, not nerve ganglia. Ventral root ganglia are involved in motor function, not sensory function. The dorsal column is responsible for transmitting sensory information, but the loss of fine touch sensation in a specific dermatome pattern suggests that the damage is more localized."

The clinical presentation suggests a sensory neuropathy, and the biopsy suggests destruction of the cell bodies of sensory nerves. Dorsal root ganglia contain the cell bodies of sensory neurons, so damage to these structures would result in loss of sensation in the affected dermatome pattern. Meissner's corpuscles are specialized sensory receptors found in the skin, but they are not related to the cell bodies of sensory neurons. Ventral root ganglia contain the cell bodies of motor neurons, and damage to these structures would result in motor deficits rather than sensory deficits. The dorsal column of the spinal cord is responsible for transmitting fine touch and proprioceptive information, but damage to this structure would result in deficits throughout the body rather than in a specific dermatome pattern."
