Thyroid hormones, especially triiodothyronine, play a critical role in metabolism and weight regulation. In patients with severe anorexia nervosa, there is often a decrease in thyroid hormone production, which can contribute to weight loss and fatigue. Growth hormone and testosterone may also be decreased in patients with anorexia nervosa, but would not be the most likely finding in this patient. Beta-hCG levels are typically not increased in patients with anorexia nervosa."
