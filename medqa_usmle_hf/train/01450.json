Intranasal vasoconstrictors such as oxymetazoline are the first-line therapy for epistaxis. Anterior nasal packing is an option if oxymetazoline fails, but silver nitrate cauterization is not recommended due to the risk of tissue necrosis. Intravenous nitroglycerin is not an appropriate intervention for nasal bleeding. The patient's hypertension should be managed, but it is not the immediate concern when dealing with her nasal bleeding."

Nasal oxymetazoline can constrict blood vessels in the nose and help stop bleeding.
