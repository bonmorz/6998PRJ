The vitelline duct is a structure that connects the yolk sac to the midgut, and abnormalities in its closure can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal anomalies, including Meckel's diverticulum, which can present with symptoms of small bowel perforation, as described in this case. The veriform appendix is a vestigial structure that has no role in this case. The anal membrane and cloaca are also embryonic structures, but they are not involved in gastrointestinal tract development in the same way as the vitelline duct."
