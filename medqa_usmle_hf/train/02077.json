High pulse pressure (difference between systolic and diastolic pressure) may actually be a sign of compensatory vasoconstriction. The Glasgow coma score is a measure of neurological function, not fluid status. A base deficit of 1 mmol/L is within normal range and does not necessarily indicate inadequate fluid resuscitation."
