The scenario describes a fungal infection that damages melanocytes by producing acids, which is most likely tinea versicolor caused by the fungus Malassezia furfur. Under microscopy, this fungus has a spaghetti and meatballs appearance, with short and stubby \"meatball\" yeast cells and longer, branching hyphae resembling spaghetti. Hence, option (D) is correct. Option (A) describes the appearance of Aspergillus, which is a filamentous fungus with septate hyphae. Option (B) describes the appearance of Candida, which is a budding yeast that can have pseudohyphae. Option (C) describes the appearance of Candida albicans, which can form germ tubes."
