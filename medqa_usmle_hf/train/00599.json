Initiation of nifedipine therapy would not be effective in this scenario.

The presence of frequent contractions, cervical dilation, and clear fluid in the vulva and introitus indicate preterm labor. However, based on the ultrasound findings of fetal anomalies, cesarean delivery should not be pursued unless there are maternal indications, such as nonreassuring fetal heart rate. Dilation and evacuation is not indicated at this gestational age. Nifedipine can be used as a tocolytic, but the fetal anomalies suggest the baby may not be viable. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to allow vaginal delivery, with appropriate counseling and support for the parents."

Cesarean delivery may be necessary in some cases, but it is generally reserved for emergency situations. Dilation and evacuation may also be an option, but it is not the best choice as the patient is already in active labor, and this procedure is typically done earlier in pregnancy. Nifedipine can be used to stop preterm labor, but in this case, the ongoing labor is likely due to the fetal abnormalities, and nifedipine is unlikely to help. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to allow vaginal delivery under close monitoring with appropriate obstetric support. The counseling and management of the patient and her family should be provided in a respectful and supportive manner."
