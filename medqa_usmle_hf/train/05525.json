The patient has a history of arterial hypertension and examination shows pretibial edema, which suggests fluid accumulation due to increased pressure in the blood vessels.

Diabetes mellitus and amyloidosis can also cause kidney damage but there are no significant findings to suggest them in this case. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a type of kidney disease but it typically presents with proteinuria and hematuria, both of which are absent in this case."

The patient has a history of arterial hypertension, and examination shows pretibial edema bilaterally, which suggests fluid retention. Laboratory studies also show elevated creatinine and protein in urine. A renal biopsy reveals arterial hyalinosis and sclerosis in the capillary tufts, which are common findings in hypertensive nephropathy. Diabetes mellitus and amyloidosis can cause kidney damage, but the presentation in this patient is more consistent with hypertensive nephropathy. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a type of kidney disease that involves inflammation and thickening of the glomeruli, but there is no evidence to suggest that in this patient."
