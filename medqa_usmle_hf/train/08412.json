The genetic mutation described in the question is a deletion of three nucleotides which results in the loss of a phenylalanine residue at position 508 in the protein. This is an example of an in-frame mutation, where the deletion does not disrupt the reading frame of the DNA sequence. This mutation is characteristic of cystic fibrosis, which can present with symptoms such as decreased height, thick secretions, and clubbing of the nails. Nonsense mutations generate a premature stop codon, triplet expansions increase the number of repeated nucleotides, and silent mutations do not result in an amino acid change."

The deletion of three nucleotides that code for a phenylalanine at position 508 is a specific mutation associated with cystic fibrosis, which is an example of an in-frame mutation. In this type of mutation, the deletion or insertion of nucleotides does not cause a frame shift, meaning that the reading frame remains the same, but it can still change the amino acid sequence of the protein. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects the CFTR protein, a chloride ion channel located in the cell membrane of various organs, leading to the production of thick mucus and other symptoms. The clubbed fingernails and respiratory symptoms are characteristic of cystic fibrosis."
