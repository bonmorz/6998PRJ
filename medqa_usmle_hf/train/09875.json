Radioactive iodine is a common treatment for hyperthyroidism caused by Graves\u2019 disease, which can lead to worsening of ocular symptoms before improvement. Methimazole and propylthiouracil are also used to treat hyperthyroidism, but they are not the most likely immediate treatment given the patient\u2019s symptom profile. Propranolol may help with palpitations and sweating, but it does not address the underlying condition."

The patient has symptoms consistent with hyperthyroidism and exophthalmos, which suggests Graves' disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Methimazole and propylthiouracil are first-line treatments for hyperthyroidism, however, they do not address the ocular symptoms. Propranolol can help manage the palpitations but does not treat the underlying condition. Radioactive iodine, on the other hand, can help shrink the thyroid gland, lower the hormone levels and alleviate the ocular symptoms of Graves' disease. Therefore, the patient most likely received radioactive iodine as a treatment."
