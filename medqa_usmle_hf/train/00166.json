The patient presents with symptoms of exertional dyspnea, syncope, and a systolic murmur in the right second intercostal area, which suggests aortic stenosis. Left ventricular hypertrophy seen in the electrocardiogram can also indicate aortic stenosis. Transthoracic echocardiography is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis of aortic stenosis and assess the severity of the condition. Cardiac chamber catheterization is more invasive and used only if other tests are inconclusive. Chest radiograph and CT chest scan without contrast may not reveal aortic stenosis."
