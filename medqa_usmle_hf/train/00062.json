The patient collided with another player's knee on the lateral aspect of his knee, which suggests a possible injury to the medial collateral ligament (MCL). The lack of swelling or effusion indicates it is not a major injury, and the lack of laxity on Lachman's and posterior drawer tests rules out ACL and PCL injuries. The increased laxity on valgus stress test compared to the unaffected knee confirms an MCL injury."

The lack of laxity in Lachman's test and posterior drawer test indicates that the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments are intact.

The valgus stress test indicates that the patient has an injury to the medial collateral ligament (MCL), which connects the femur to the tibia on the inner side of the knee joint. The intact sensation and strength in both lower extremities, as well as the firm endpoints on Lachman's and posterior drawer tests, suggest that the other major ligaments (the ACL and PCL) are not injured. The lack of swelling or effusion indicates that there is no significant joint inflammation."

The lack of swelling or effusion and the firm endpoints on Lachman's and posterior drawer tests make it less likely to be an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury.
