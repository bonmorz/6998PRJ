The patient\u2019s symptoms include fever, lethargy, and poor feeding after birth, which are suggestive of a neonatal sepsis. The fact that the baby was born at home without proper prenatal care puts the baby at risk for infections present in the birth canal. Therefore, the most likely source of this patient\u2019s infection is during birth. Option A (contaminated food) and option D (infection from surgery) are unlikely causes for a 6-day-old newborn. Option C (mother\u2019s roommate) is an irrelevant distractor."
