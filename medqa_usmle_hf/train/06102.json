Among the options, the most common type of lung cancer associated with ectopic ACTH secretion is small cell lung cancer."

The high blood pressure, easy bruising, and supraclavicular fat pads suggest Cushing syndrome, which can be associated with small cell lung cancer. Squamous cell lung cancer may also present with similar symptoms but would typically appear as a central mass on imaging.

Wegener granulomatosis can cause respiratory symptoms but would not typically present with a mass on imaging."

Squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma do not commonly secrete ACTH. Wegener granulomatosis can also cause lung nodules, but it would not explain the patient's Cushingoid features."
