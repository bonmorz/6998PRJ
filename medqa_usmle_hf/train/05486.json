The patient\u2019s symptoms such as forgetfulness, confusion, mood changes, misplacing items, and becoming lost suggest dementia. The MRI findings of deep white matter lesions suggest vascular dementia, which is caused by damage to blood vessels in the brain. This is the most likely diagnosis as the patient has hypertension and coronary artery disease, which are risk factors for vascular dementia. The other options are less likely causes of dementia."

The patient's symptoms suggest a gradual onset and progression of cognitive decline, which is consistent with vascular dementia. The presence of multiple deep white matter lesions on MRI also supports this diagnosis. The other options are less likely based on the patient's presentation and findings. Frontotemporal dementia typically presents with behavioral and personality changes early in the course of the disease. Alzheimer disease is characterized by a gradual decline in memory and other cognitive functions, usually without significant motor deficits. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause cognitive impairment, but it typically presents with other neurological symptoms such as numbness and tingling in the extremities."
