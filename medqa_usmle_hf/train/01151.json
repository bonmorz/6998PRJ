The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and medication with metoprolol suggest that her medication is aimed at decreasing heart rate and blood pressure.

Taking a double dose might have further decreased adenylyl cyclase activity and contributed to her fainting episode.

Metoprolol is a beta-blocker, which works by blocking beta receptors, including beta-1 receptors found in cardiac muscle cells. These receptors are responsible for activating adenylyl cyclase, which converts ATP into cyclic AMP, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium and contraction of cardiac muscle. By blocking beta-1 receptors, metoprolol decreases activity of adenylyl cyclase and reduces cardiac output. Taking a double dose of metoprolol can further decrease cardiac output and contribute to a decrease in activity of adenylyl cyclase, leading to the patient's episode of loss of consciousness."
