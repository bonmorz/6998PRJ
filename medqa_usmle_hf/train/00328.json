The patient\u2019s symptoms of bladder discomfort and frequent urination, as well as the negative urinalysis for infection, suggest interstitial cystitis. This is further supported by the tenderness to palpation of the suprapubic region, and the normal cystoscopy findings. Overactive bladder may also cause frequent urination, but it usually presents with urgency and urge incontinence. Urinary retention is unlikely given the patient\u2019s high frequency of urination and the postvoid residual volume of 25 mL. Diabetes insipidus is characterized by excessive urination and thirst, but is not associated with bladder discomfort or pain during intercourse."

Urinary retention would cause a lack of urination, rather than the frequent urination experienced by the patient.
