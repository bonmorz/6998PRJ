The symptoms are consistent with tularemia, especially the large tender node in the right axilla. Gram staining of a sputum sample is negative for any organism, and serology tests are negative, which is also consistent with tularemia as it can be difficult to diagnose due to low bacterial load in the acute phase."

Staphylococcus aureus is more commonly associated with pneumonia in healthcare settings, while Yersinia pestis is associated with bubonic and pneumonic plague, which do not present with the same symptoms as the patient."
