A noncontrast CT scan is the best next step in management to evaluate for these possible causes. A KUB plain film may not be as sensitive for detecting smaller stones and may not provide a detailed enough image for adequate evaluation. A transvaginal ultrasound would not be helpful in evaluating for possible urinary or gastrointestinal causes of the patient\u2019s symptoms.
