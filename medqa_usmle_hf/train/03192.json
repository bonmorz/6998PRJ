Cortical atrophy, both minor and severe, may be seen in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, but it is not specific to normal pressure hydrocephalus."

Decreased dopamine synthesis in the substantia nigra is a characteristic finding in Parkinson's disease, but it's not the most likely finding in this patient. Minor or severe atrophy of the cerebral cortex on CT or MRI could also be seen in patients with dementia or Alzheimer's disease, but the presence of a recent head injury makes dilated ventricles a more likely finding."
