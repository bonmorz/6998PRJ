Continuing sertraline for 3 more weeks may allow for further improvement in the patient\u2019s symptoms before considering augmenting with additional medication or providing electroconvulsive therapy. Option B and C suggest adding other medications, which may have risks and side effects, and may not be necessary if the current medication has not been given enough time to work. Option A may be considered after other options have been exhausted and the patient is not responding to other treatments."

Option B, augmentation with another antidepressant, may be considered if there is no improvement after 4-6 weeks of the initial antidepressant. Option C, augmentation with an antipsychotic, is not the first-line treatment for depression and should only be considered in certain cases."
