The patient has a history of previous ED visits with similar complaints that had resolved on one occasion with narcotic agents, suggesting they are deliberately faking the symptoms for a secondary gain, which is known as malingering.

Conversion disorder refers to the presence of neurological symptoms without a known neurological explanation, but the patient\u2019s symptoms do not fit this diagnosis."
