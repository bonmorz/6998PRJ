Ptosis on the right is associated with a lesion in the oculomotor nerve, but this would affect other ocular movements as well. Left abduction palsy on leftward gaze would be consistent with a lesion in the left lateral rectus muscle or its innervating nerve. An afferent pupillary defect in the left eye would suggest optic nerve involvement, but this is not associated with the patient's ocular findings."
