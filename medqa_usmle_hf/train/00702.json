Levodopa is used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, and the addition of carbidopa will decrease the amount of levodopa needed to achieve a therapeutic effect. Carbidopa also reduces peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine, which can cause adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, and orthostatic hypotension. Therefore, the addition of carbidopa is most likely to decrease the risk of orthostatic hypotension as a potential adverse drug effect."

Among the potential adverse drug effects, orthostatic hypotension is the most likely to be decreased by the addition of carbidopa. Resting tremor, visual hallucinations, and dyskinesia are potential adverse effects of levodopa, but they are not affected by the addition of carbidopa."
