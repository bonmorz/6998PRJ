The symptoms suggest the patient has orbital cellulitis, which can lead to damage of the facial nerve CN VII and the trigeminal nerve CN V, but typically does not affect the optic nerve, so decreased vision with sparing of the optic disc is unlikely. Sympathetic innervation to the pupil may also be affected, resulting in a dilated pupil that does not constrict in response to light. The blink reflex, which is mediated by CN VII, is most likely to be affected, and may be absent in this patient."

The edema and proptosis can cause compression of the ophthalmic nerve (CN V1), leading to loss of the blink reflex. Anesthesia along the CN V3 distribution is not common in orbital cellulitis, and decreased vision with sparing of the optic disc suggests an optic neuropathy.

An absent blink reflex can occur due to involvement of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, which innervates the orbicularis oculi muscle responsible for the blink reflex. Anesthesia along the CN V3 distribution is unlikely, as this branch does not innervate the eye but rather the jaw and lower face. Decreased vision may occur if there is compression of the optic nerve or retina, but sparing of the optic disc is unlikely. Sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation may be affected in Horner's syndrome, but this is not the most likely diagnosis in this case."

The symptoms described suggest orbital cellulitis, which can cause ophthalmoplegia, proptosis, and periorbital erythema and edema. The absent blink reflex is an important clinical sign in differentiating orbital cellulitis from preseptal cellulitis, which is less severe and does not affect the extraocular muscles or optic nerve. Anesthesia along the CN V3 distribution suggests involvement of the trigeminal nerve, which is not typically affected in orbital cellulitis. Decreased vision with sparing of the optic disc suggests optic neuritis.
