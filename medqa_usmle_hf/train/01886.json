The severe nausea and vomiting after alcohol consumption suggest that the patient may have a disulfiram-like reaction, which is a known side effect of drugs like terbinafine that inhibit liver enzymes responsible for alcohol metabolism."

Inhibition of DNA synthesis is a mechanism of action for some antibiotics, but it is not relevant in this case. Cell arrest at metaphase is a mechanism of action for griseofulvin, which is an antifungal medication that can interact with alcohol and cause nausea and vomiting. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Cell arrest at metaphase."

The intermittent rash with itching and burning on the feet suggests a fungal infection, which can be treated with antifungal medications.

The symptoms of severe nausea and vomiting after drinking alcohol two days later suggest a possible drug interaction with the antifungal agent causing a disulfiram-like reaction, but this is not related to the mechanism of action of the drug itself. Answer (A) Cell arrest at metaphase is the mechanism of action of mitotic inhibitors such as vincristine and paclitaxel, which are used to treat cancer. Answer (C) Inhibition of cell wall synthesis and Answer (D) Inhibition of DNA synthesis are mechanisms of action for antibiotics, such as penicillins and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. These drugs are not effective against fungal infections."
