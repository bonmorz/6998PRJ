The patient has a history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and uses cocaine, which suggests that he may be taking an antiepileptic drug (AED). The gingival overgrowth is a side effect of phenytoin, which is a commonly used AED. Lamotrigine and carbamazepine may also be used to treat epilepsy, but they are less commonly associated with gingival overgrowth. Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant drug used after organ transplantation and is also associated with gingival overgrowth."
