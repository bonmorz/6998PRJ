The presentation of severe abdominal pain with increasing intensity over time, along with a history of peptic ulcer disease and H. pylori infection being treated with clarithromycin triple therapy, suggests a possible complication such as perforation or bleeding. The chest radiograph shows intraperitoneal air, further supporting the diagnosis of perforation. Emergency abdominal surgery is the next best step in management. Option (A) may be considered to further evaluate the cause and extent of the perforation, but it should not delay surgery. Option (B) is not indicated in this case as endoscopy would not be able to address a perforation. Option (D) may help decrease gastric distention and discomfort, but it would not address the cause of the patient's symptoms."
