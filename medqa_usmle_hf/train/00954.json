The infant is presenting with symptoms of transposition of the great arteries (TGA), a congenital heart defect where the pulmonary artery arises from the right ventricle and the aorta arises from the left ventricle. Further evaluation of the mother is most likely to show elevated fasting blood glucose, as maternal diabetes is a known risk factor for TGA. None of the other options are associated with an increased risk of TGA."

The baby has symptoms of transposition of the great arteries, which is caused by abnormal fetal development in the first eight weeks of pregnancy. Mothers with high blood glucose levels have a higher risk of giving birth to babies with this condition. Prenatal alcohol use and phenytoin intake can cause fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal hydantoin syndrome respectively, but are not associated with transposition of the great arteries. The rapid plasma reagin test is used to diagnose syphilis and has no relevance to this case."

Elevated fasting blood glucose is associated with gestational diabetes, which can increase the risk of congenital heart defects including transposition of the great vessels. Therefore, further evaluation of the mother should focus on testing for gestational diabetes."
