The symptoms suggest a stroke, and the facial droop and slight weakness on the right side indicate a left-sided lesion.

Occlusion of the right penetrating arteries may cause hemiparesis of the contralateral side, but facial droop is not a common symptom. Occlusion of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery may cause vertigo, nausea, and vomiting, but not facial droop or speech difficulty. Rupture of left posterior cerebral artery malformation may cause visual disturbance but not facial droop or speech difficulty."
