The patient has nocturnal cough, increased albuterol usage, and bilateral end-expiratory wheezing, which suggest poorly controlled asthma. Adding daily inhaled corticosteroids is the best next step in the treatment. Option A is not a good plan because it does not address the underlying issue of poorly controlled asthma. Option B may be helpful, but inhaled corticosteroids have been shown to be more effective in controlling asthma symptoms. Option D is not appropriate because the patient does not have symptoms of allergies."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest worsening asthma, as evidenced by the increase in rescue inhaler use and decrease in PEFR. Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for persistent asthma, and adding them to the current regimen would be the best next step in treating this patient. Option (A) is not appropriate as increasing the frequency of albuterol without addressing the underlying inflammation can lead to worsening symptoms. Option (B) may be helpful in reducing bronchospasm, but it does not target the underlying inflammation. Option (D) is not appropriate as the patient does not have symptoms suggestive of allergic rhinitis."

Option A is not appropriate as it does not address the underlying issue of poorly controlled asthma. Option B may be considered but is not the first-line therapy for poorly controlled asthma.

The patient has a history of asthma that has worsened over the last 4 weeks, with increased use of rescue inhaler and end-expiratory wheezing. PEFR is also reduced. These symptoms suggest poorly controlled asthma and the need for long-term daily control medication. Inhaled corticosteroids are the recommended first-line therapy for long-term control of asthma. Adding ipratropium bromide may be useful in acute exacerbations, but not for long-term control. Adding oral levocetirizine for allergy symptoms is not necessary as the patient does not report any. Using inhaled albuterol four times daily may provide temporary relief, but will not address underlying inflammation and is not appropriate for long-term control."
