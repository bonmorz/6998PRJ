The incremental pattern on repetitive nerve conduction studies is characteristic of LEMS. Antibodies against muscle-specific kinase may be present in patients with myasthenia gravis but not LEMS. Periventricular plaques on MRI of the brain are seen in multiple sclerosis. Thymoma may be associated with myasthenia gravis, but not LEMS."

The patient has symptoms suggestive of myasthenia gravis (diplopia, difficulty in climbing stairs and hair combing, drooping eyelid, difficulty in abducting right eye, and muscle weakness), as well as autonomic dysfunction (blood pressure changes, absent deep tendon reflexes). The absence of sensory deficits and presence of diffuse wheezes suggest a neuromuscular rather than a neurological issue. Therefore, the most likely finding would be an incremental pattern on repetitive nerve conduction studies, which would suggest a disorder of neuromuscular transmission like myasthenia gravis. Antibodies against muscle-specific kinase can be seen in some cases of myasthenia gravis, but testing for them is not always necessary. Periventricular plaques on MRI of the brain are seen in multiple sclerosis, which would not explain the patient's symptoms. Thymoma on CT scan of the chest can be associated with myasthenia gravis, but not all patients with myasthenia gravis have thymoma, and the presence of thymoma would not necessarily change the initial management of the patient's symptoms."

The drooping of the right upper eyelid and difficulty in abducting the right eye indicates extraocular muscle weakness, and the difficulty in climbing stairs and combing hair indicates proximal muscle weakness. The reduced muscle strength in the proximal muscles of all 4 limbs with absent deep tendon reflexes is also suggestive of myasthenia gravis. The incremental pattern on repetitive nerve conduction studies is used to diagnose myasthenia gravis. Antibodies against muscle-specific kinase are associated with a rare form of myasthenia gravis that often presents with bulbar and ocular muscle weakness. Periventricular plaques on MRI of the brain are seen in patients with multiple sclerosis. Thymoma is associated with myasthenia gravis, but it is not always present."
