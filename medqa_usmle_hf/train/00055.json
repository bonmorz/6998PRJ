The symptoms presented by the infant suggests a condition called hyperammonemia-hyperornithinemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome, which is caused by defects in the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I enzyme. This enzyme is important in the urea cycle, which removes ammonia from the body. Defects in this enzyme result in the accumulation of ammonia and other toxic substances in the body, leading to symptoms such as vomiting, hyperventilation, lethargy, seizures, and cerebral edema. The other enzyme defects listed do not cause this specific set of symptoms."
