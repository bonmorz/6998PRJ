The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, light headedness, increased urination, and weight gain in the abdomen, with a low hemoglobin count indicating anemia. The increased bleeding during periods and the family history of von Willebrand disease also raise suspicion for a gynecologic issue. Based on these findings, a pelvic ultrasound would be the best next step to evaluate for any gynecologic causes of the patient's symptoms. TSH levels would be appropriate to test for thyroid dysfunction, but it is not the best next step in this scenario. Hysteroscopy and von Willebrand factor antigen would be more specific tests for certain conditions, such as uterine abnormalities or von Willebrand disease, respectively, but they would not be the best initial step in this case."
