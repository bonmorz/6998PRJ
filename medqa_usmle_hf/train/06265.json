The physical exam findings, such as puffy face and thinning eyebrows, also suggest hypothyroidism. Elevated TSH is a common finding in hypothyroidism. Elevated midnight cortisol suggests Cushing syndrome, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms or physical exam findings. Elevated LH:FSH ratio suggests polycystic ovary syndrome, which is a possibility due to heavy menstrual flow and possibly elevated androgens, but it is not the most likely finding given no other signs of hyperandrogenism. Elevated androgens suggest hyperandrogenism, which is a possibility given the patient's symptoms, but it is not the most likely finding based on the information provided."
