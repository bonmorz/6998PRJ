The symptoms described suggest that the patient is experiencing an ischemic stroke, with facial drooping and complete paralysis of the right upper and lower extremities. Exaggerated deep tendon reflexes on the right suggest that the stroke is caused by occlusion of the contralateral lenticulostriate artery, which supplies the basal ganglia and internal capsule. The other options are not associated with the symptoms described."

The fact that her speech is normal and she is able to swallow liquids without difficulty narrows it down to a lacunar stroke. The fact that her knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes are exaggerated on the right suggests damage to the corticospinal tract, which is supplied by the contralateral lenticulostriate artery."
