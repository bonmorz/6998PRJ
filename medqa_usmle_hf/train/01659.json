Inhibition of messenger RNA synthesis is characteristic of hepatotoxicity caused by toxins found in wild mushrooms, including amatoxins. Thus, option A is the correct answer. Microtubule polymerization inhibition is seen in neurotoxicity caused by toxins from mushrooms such as Amanita muscaria. Parasympathetic activation and cell depolarization are not causative factors in this scenario."
