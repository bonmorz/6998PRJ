The patient's hyponatremia is most likely due to physiologic ADH (vasopressin) secretion, which can occur in response to hypovolemia. The patient's decreased blood pressure and elevated heart rate suggest hypovolemia, which can stimulate ADH secretion, leading to water retention and dilution of serum sodium levels. Pathologic aldosterone secretion or adrenal crisis would not typically cause hyponatremia. Pathologic ADH secretion, also known as SIADH, can cause hyponatremia, but the mechanism of hypovolemia in this patient makes physiologic ADH secretion a more likely explanation."

Pathologic ADH secretion usually isn't associated with trauma or fractures, while physiologic ADH secretion can occur in response to pain, stress or trauma.
