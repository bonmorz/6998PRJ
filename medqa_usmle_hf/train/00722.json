The patient has symptoms of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and the most appropriate initial step in management is graded exercise therapy.

Propranolol therapy and spinal cord stimulation are not appropriate for PAD. Vascular bypass surgery may be considered if symptoms do not improve with exercise therapy or if a limb-threatening ischemia is present."
