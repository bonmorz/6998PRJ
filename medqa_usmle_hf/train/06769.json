Tuberculosis treatment often includes antibiotics that can chelate lead, leading to redistribution of stored lead, and subsequent toxicity. Vitamin B6 is essential for heme synthesis, and lead can interfere with its metabolism, leading to decreased heme synthesis and anemia. Abnormally low levels of glutathione activity and inhibition of ferrochelatase and ALA dehydratase are not likely explanations for the patient\u2019s symptoms."

The peripheral blood smear shows normochromic, normocytic red blood cells and neutrophilic hypersegmentation, which are characteristic findings of vitamin B6 deficiency. This deficiency can be caused by isoniazid, a drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis, which inhibits pyridoxal phosphate, an active form of vitamin B6. The other options do not fit with the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings."

The peripheral blood smear shows a normocytic and normochromic anemia with basophilic stippling, which is a sign of lead poisoning. Treatment for tuberculosis often includes isoniazid, which can cause a vitamin B6 deficiency and result in symptoms like fatigue and lightheadedness. Hence, option (B) is the correct answer. Abnormally low level of glutathione activity is seen in patients with G6PD deficiency. Inhibition of ferrochelatase and ALA dehydratase can cause sideroblastic anemia, but this patient does not have any other symptoms of this condition. Iron deficiency usually causes microcytic anemia, but this patient has normocytic anemia."

The peripheral blood smear in Figure A shows a hypersegmented neutrophil, which is a classic finding in vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Since the patient denies bloody or dark stools and has a normal physical examination, the most likely cause is drug-induced deficiency in vitamin B6 due to his recent diagnosis of active tuberculosis and starting treatment 2 weeks ago, as the medication used for tuberculosis treatment can interfere with vitamin B6 absorption. Options A, C, and D are not related to the patient\u2019s symptoms."
