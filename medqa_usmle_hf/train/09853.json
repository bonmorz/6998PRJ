Studies have shown that it is safe to use during pregnancy, and there is no evidence to suggest that it causes harm to the fetus. In fact, it is important for pregnant women with hypothyroidism to continue taking levothyroxine to maintain normal thyroid hormone levels, which are essential for fetal development. Therefore, option (D) is correct. Options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect."
