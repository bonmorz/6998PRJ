Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is produced by the placenta and maintains the corpus luteum during early pregnancy, which in turn produces progesterone. Therefore, the presence of hCG impedes the normal involution of the corpus luteum during pregnancy, leading to continued production of progesterone to support the pregnancy. Cortisol and estrogen also play important roles in pregnancy, but they do not directly impede the involution of the corpus luteum."

In a normal menstrual cycle, the corpus luteum involutes due to a decrease in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), but during pregnancy, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is produced by the placenta and acts on the corpus luteum to maintain elevated levels of progesterone. Therefore, the answer is (B) Human chorionic gonadotropin."
