The symptoms suggest a bacterial infection, likely streptococcal pharyngitis, and a throat swab is taken for culture to confirm the diagnosis. Penicillin V is the first-line antibiotic of choice for this condition. However, given the patient's previous medication allergy, erythromycin would be a safer alternative. Tonsillectomy is not indicated at this time. Fluconazole is used for fungal infections, which are not likely to be the cause of this patient's symptoms."
