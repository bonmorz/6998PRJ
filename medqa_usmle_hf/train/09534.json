The physical findings suggest a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is a communication between the left and right ventricles. The harsh holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border and soft mid-diastolic murmur over the cardiac apex are typical for a VSD. Communication between the pulmonary artery and the thoracic aorta (a patent ductus arteriosus) would cause a continuous murmur, not a holosystolic one. Right-to-left shunt through the atrial septum (an atrial septal defect) would present with a fixed split second heart sound and a wide, fixed split between S2 and preceding systole. Right ventricular outflow obstruction (pulmonary stenosis or tetralogy of Fallot) would present with a crescendo-decrescendo ejection systolic murmur over the upper to mid-left sternal border, not a holosystolic murmur."

The patient has a harsh holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, which is characteristic of ventricular septal defect (VSD), a common congenital heart defect. The soft mid-diastolic murmur over the cardiac apex may be due to increased blood flow across the mitral valve. This is consistent with left-to-right shunt through the ventricular septum. None of the other options explain VSD or left-to-right shunt."
