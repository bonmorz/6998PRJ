The symptoms of pallor, macrocytic anemia with eosinophilia, and peripheral blood smear findings suggest an infection with a type of cestode known as Diphyllobothrium latum, which is commonly known as the fish tapeworm. Praziquantel is a drug that is commonly used to treat cestode infections, including those caused by D. latum. Praziquantel kills cestodes by inducing uncontrollable muscle spasm in the parasite, leading to paralysis and death. This effect is achieved by causing increased calcium influx into the sarcoplasm of the parasite's muscle cells, which disrupts the normal function of the cells and leads to paralysis. Therefore, the correct answer is (A), increased calcium influx into the sarcoplasm."
