Muscle type X has the fastest calcium reuptake and therefore the highest cytosolic calcium concentration, which is a property of skeletal muscle cells. Muscle type Y and Z have lower cytosolic calcium concentrations but higher than their corresponding controls, suggesting they both have a slower calcium reuptake. Muscle type Y is distinguished from Z by its pattern of luminescence when tagged with titin, which is a property of cardiac muscle cells. Therefore, the most likely set of muscle cell types is X-skeletal muscle, Y-cardiac muscle, Z-smooth muscle. Option (C) is the only one with this combination."

Muscle type Y and Z had lower, equal cytosolic calcium concentrations but higher than their corresponding controls, which is characteristic of cardiac muscle and smooth muscle, respectively. Further differentiation between muscle types Y and Z was done using fluorescence microscopy, which revealed muscle type Y to have a luminescent pattern in titin, a protein found in skeletal muscle, suggesting that muscle type Y is actually skeletal muscle. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, smooth muscle."

The muscle type with the highest cytosolic calcium concentration after depolarization is most likely skeletal muscle, as it has a higher concentration of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase. Muscle type Y is identified by the luminescent pattern in titin, which is most prominently found in skeletal muscle. Therefore, muscle type Y is skeletal muscle, muscle type X is cardiac muscle (as it has the highest cytosolic calcium concentration), and muscle type Z is smooth muscle (as it has a lower cytosolic calcium concentration compared to X and Y). The correct answer is (C)."
