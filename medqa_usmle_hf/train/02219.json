Live attenuated vaccines require stricter cold chain maintenance than subunit vaccines because the live virus is more sensitive to temperature changes, and exposure to high or low temperatures can lead to a loss of potency or viability. Option (A) is incorrect because LAV is more prone to immunization errors due to the fact that it contains a live organism. Option (B) is incorrect because LAV can cause symptomatic infection in immunocompetent individuals, although the risk is low. Option (C) is incorrect because LAV is not recommended for administration to pregnant women."

The correct answer is (D) because live attenuated vaccines require strict temperature control to maintain their effectiveness, while subunit vaccines do not have the same requirements. Option (A) is incorrect because LAV can actually have a higher potential for immunization errors due to the need for careful handling and administration. Option (B) is incorrect because LAV can cause symptomatic infection in certain individuals, such as those with weakened immune systems.

Option A is incorrect because both LAV and subunit vaccines can potentially have immunization errors. Option B is incorrect because LAV can cause symptomatic infection in immunocompetent individuals, although this risk is low. Option C is incorrect because LAV is contraindicated in pregnant women due to theoretical risks of harming the fetus."
