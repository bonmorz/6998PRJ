The patient's history and symptoms suggest a bleeding disorder, and laboratory studies reveal a prolonged partial thromboplastin time, indicating a problem with the intrinsic coagulation pathway. The normal-sized platelets rule out Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which is characterized by enlarged platelets. Immune thrombocytopenia is characterized by a low platelet count, which is not the case here. Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare inherited disorder characterized by dysfunctional platelets, which would appear abnormal on the peripheral blood smear. Hemophilia is a better fit based on the history of easy bruising and family history, and the prolonged partial thromboplastin time suggests a deficiency in clotting factors typically affected in hemophilia."
