The enlarged clitoris with fusion of the labioscrotal folds suggests virilization due to increased sex hormones. The hyponatremia and hyperkalemia suggests decreased aldosterone function. The most likely diagnosis is 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which leads to decreased cortisol and aldosterone and increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone and sex hormones. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer."

Option C best fits the expected hormone imbalances in this condition, with increased sex hormones leading to unclear genitalia and increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Option A fits 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, but the clinical presentation does not match with hypertension and metabolic alkalosis. Option B fits 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency, but the clinical presentation does not match with hypotension and low sodium. Option D fits primary adrenal insufficiency, but the clinical presentation does not match with hyperkalemia and female genitalia."

The symptoms and findings suggest congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which results in inadequate production of cortisol and aldosterone and accumulation of androgen precursors. The enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labioscrotal folds suggest virilization due to excess androgens. The hyperkalemia and hyponatremia are due to lack of aldosterone. The increased sex hormones and increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels are characteristic of CAH. Option A is incorrect because decreased cortisol suggests adrenal insufficiency, but aldosterone would also be decreased. Option B is incorrect because there would be no increase in 11-deoxycorticosterone in CAH. Option D is incorrect because renin activity would be increased in response to the lack of aldosterone."

This leads to increased androgen production, leading to enlargement of the clitoris and fusion of the labioscrotal folds. Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia are also typical findings. Further workup would reveal increased sex hormones (such as testosterone) and increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone, a precursor to androgen production. Decreased renin activity (option D) is not typical in CAH. Option A describes findings in Addison\u2019s disease and option B describes a type of CAH (11-beta hydroxylase deficiency), but those are not the most likely findings in this case."

Based on the symptoms and physical exam, the infant likely has congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), specifically 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

In addition, there is an increase in sex hormones, including 17-hydroxyprogesterone, which can cause the genital abnormalities observed in the exam. Therefore, the most likely finding upon further workup would be increased sex hormones and increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone."
