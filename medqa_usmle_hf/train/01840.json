Pituitary tumors can lead to decreased secretion of gonadotropins, resulting in amenorrhea, and can also compress the optic chiasm, leading to visual changes. Among the options, only decreased bone density is associated with pituitary tumors, secondary to decreased levels of estrogen and testosterone. Breast mass, enlarged thyroid, and renal failure are not typically associated with pituitary tumors."
