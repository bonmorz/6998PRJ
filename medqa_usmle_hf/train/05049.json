Since the patient reports multiple sexual partners and inconsistent condom use, it could also be a symptom of HIV infection. However, the next step in treatment should be improving oral hygiene, since thrush can be caused by poor oral hygiene as well. Nystatin may be prescribed if symptoms persist, but changing toothbrush and improving oral hygiene would be the first step in treatment. Surgical excision and topical corticosteroids are not appropriate for this condition."

Based on the patient\u2019s history, the lesion could be a manifestation of an underlying sexually transmitted infection. However, before prescribing any treatment, the patient\u2019s oral hygiene should be improved by changing their toothbrush and using methods such as saltwater rinses or gentle brushing to reduce inflammation. If the symptoms persist, further testing and treatment may be necessary. Therefore, option A is the best initial step in the treatment of this patient."
