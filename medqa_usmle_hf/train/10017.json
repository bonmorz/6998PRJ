The patient and her husband shared a delusional belief in their ability to heal with their thoughts, which is characteristic of Folie \u00e0 deux. The fact that the patient no longer believes in the powers after separating from her husband suggests that the delusional belief was shared and not solely originating from the patient herself, ruling out schizophrenia and its residual phase. Additionally, there is no evidence of mood disturbances or socio-occupational impairment to suggest schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder. Culture-specific psychosis is a term used to describe conditions specific to a particular culture, which is not applicable in this case."

Folie \u00e0 deux, also known as shared psychotic disorder, is a rare psychiatric syndrome in which symptoms of a delusional belief are transmitted from one individual to another. In this case, the woman's belief in her and her husband's healing powers was transmitted from her husband to her. Her separation from him led to her abandoning her delusional belief. Schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia typically involve more persistent and severe symptoms, while culture-specific psychosis refers to delusional beliefs specific to a particular cultural group. The residual phase of schizophrenia refers to a period of less intense symptoms after an acute episode of schizophrenia."

Schizophreniform disorder involves symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions lasting between one and six months, which is not the case here.
