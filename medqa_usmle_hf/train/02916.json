The patient\u2019s symptoms, including dyspnea, cough, non-radiating chest pain and a scratchy rub heard best with the patient leaning forward, are suggestive of Acute pericarditis. Constrictive pericarditis would have a different physical examination finding of Kussmaul's sign, pulsus paradoxus, or pericardial knock. Libman-Sacks endocarditis is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, which is not mentioned as part of the patient\u2019s medical history. Acute myocardial infarction would present with different symptoms such as radiating chest pain and ST elevation on EKG."
