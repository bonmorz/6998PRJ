The positive staining for acid-fast bacilli suggest tuberculosis meningitis, which requires long-term use of isoniazid and rifampin.

Acyclovir is not necessary since the CSF analysis did not suggest viral meningitis, and treatment should not be delayed until culture results are available since tuberculosis meningitis is a medical emergency. Response to antibiotic therapy should also be monitored, but it is not the most important aspect of immediate management."
