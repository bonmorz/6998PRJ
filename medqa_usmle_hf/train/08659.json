The presentation and diagnosis suggest Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is caused by a gastrin-secreting pancreatic or duodenal tumor. This tumor can also cause hyperparathyroidism, so parathyroid hormone should be examined in this patient. Calcitonin, plasma metanephrines, and thyroid stimulating hormone are unrelated to this condition."

The symptoms and history suggest duodenal ulcers, and the positive fecal occult blood test confirms the presence of bleeding. Elevated gastrin levels after a secretin stimulation test indicate a gastrinoma, which can cause Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. This syndrome is associated with elevated levels of gastric acid and can lead to peptic ulcers. Calcitonin is associated with medullary thyroid cancer, plasma metanephrines are associated with pheochromocytoma, and thyroid stimulating hormone is associated with thyroid disorders, none of which are likely to be related to the patient\u2019s symptoms. Parathyroid hormone is associated with hyperparathyroidism, which can cause peptic ulcers and should be examined in this patient."
