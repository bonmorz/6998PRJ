Acute cholecystitis is unlikely as there is no mention of gallbladder tenderness or fever. Choledocholithiasis is unlikely as there is no mention of jaundice or clay-colored stools. Gallbladder cancer is also unlikely as it is a less common diagnosis and would require further imaging tests for confirmation."
