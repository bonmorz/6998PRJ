The total number of patients who received haloperidol and did not develop diabetes is 279.

The proportion of patients who received haloperidol and developed diabetes is 21. Therefore, the total number of patients who developed diabetes is 51 (30 + 21).\nTo calculate the proportion of patients receiving clozapine who would not have been diagnosed with diabetes if they had been taking a typical antipsychotic, we need to calculate the proportion of patients receiving clozapine who developed diabetes: 30/300 = 0.1. \nThen we need to calculate the proportion of patients receiving haloperidol who developed diabetes: 21/300 = 0.07. \nThe difference between the two proportions is 0.03, which is the answer (C).
