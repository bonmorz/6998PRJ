Placenta accreta is unlikely given the patient's history of previous vaginal deliveries. Bloody show is normal during labor and not associated with severe vaginal bleeding."

Placenta previa would present with painless vaginal bleeding and a normal fetal heart rate. Placenta accreta is not likely given the patient's history of previous vaginal deliveries.

The fetal heart rate is also low, which could indicate that the fetus is in distress due to the bleeding. Placenta previa and accreta do not usually present with severe bleeding, and bloody show typically occurs earlier in pregnancy. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is ruptured vasa previa."
