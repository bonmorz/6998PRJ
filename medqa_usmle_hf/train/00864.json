The patient has a history of an open fracture and worsening pain in the arm, suggesting the possibility of acute compartment syndrome. Physical exam findings of severe pain with passive motion and tenderness to palpation also support this diagnosis. The next best step in management is an emergency fasciotomy to relieve the pressure in the compartment and prevent further tissue damage. Ibuprofen and reassurance may not address the underlying issue and radiography may not be helpful in diagnosing compartment syndrome. Measurement of compartment pressure may be useful, but the patient's severe symptoms warrant more urgent intervention."

The worsening pain and tenderness to palpation in a patient with a recent fracture suggests the possibility of compartment syndrome.

Radiography may be helpful to rule out new fractures, but it is not urgent in this situation. Ibuprofen and reassurance alone is not appropriate for a suspected compartment syndrome."
