Warfarin is used to prevent deep venous thrombosis but its effects need to be monitored with INR levels, which should ideally be between 2-3. An INR of 4.0 indicates over-anticoagulation, which can lead to bleeding complications. Among the options, only omeprazole can interact with warfarin and increase its effects, leading to over-anticoagulation. Lisinopril and atorvastatin are not known to interact with warfarin, and cetirizine is an antihistamine used for seasonal allergies and does not interact with warfarin."
