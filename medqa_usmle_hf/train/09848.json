Her mother having glaucoma is not relevant to her current symptoms, as there are no findings suggesting angle-closure glaucoma. The patient's vision is 20/20 in both eyes, so it is not diabetic retinopathy. Age-related macular degeneration typically affects people over 60, and the patient's age is not specified in the question stem."

The patient's symptoms suggest a problem with the retina, and among the options, only chloroquine retinopathy causes bilateral bull's eye macular lesions. The patient's history of taking chloroquine supports this diagnosis. Risk factors for chloroquine retinopathy include daily doses greater than 3 mg/kg and a duration of use greater than 5 years. The patient's dosage and duration are unknown, but her BMI suggests that she may have been taking a higher than normal dose."

The patient's symptoms, including black spots in vision, difficulty adapting to changes in lighting, and bull's eye macular lesions, are all consistent with chloroquine retinopathy. The patient's history of taking chloroquine for rheumatoid arthritis and her normal anterior segment on slit lamp examination further support this diagnosis. Diabetes may cause diabetic retinopathy, but the patient's blood sugar levels are not mentioned to be out of control. Glaucoma may cause vision loss, but the patient's anterior segment on slit lamp examination is normal. Age-related macular degeneration is a possibility given the patient's age, but it typically presents with drusen and does not have bull's eye macular lesions."
