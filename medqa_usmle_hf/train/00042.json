The blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and presence of petechiae suggest septic shock, which is common in meningococcal infections. The cloudy appearance and elevated protein in the CSF suggest bacterial meningitis, which is confirmed by the positive culture for N. meningitidis. Among the options, only formation of C5-9 (also known as the membrane attack complex) is implicated in the body's defense against bacterial infections like meningococcal septicaemia and meningitis. Therefore, this child's impaired ability to form C5-9 complex would be the most likely immunological process responsible for his susceptibility to severe bacterial infections."

Impaired production of IL-2 by Th1 cells can cause immunodeficiency, but it is less likely to be the cause in this scenario. Activation of TCRs by MHC-II and cleavage of C2 component of complement into C2a and C2b are also important in the immune response, but they are less likely to be impaired in this case."

The low glucose level in the cerebrospinal fluid indicates impaired glucose metabolism, which could be a result of formation of C5-9 complex impairing bacterial clearance. Therefore, the answer is (C). Production of IL-2 by Th1 cells is involved in cell-mediated immunity. Activation of TCRs by MHC-II is involved in antigen presentation to T cells. Cleavage of C2 component of complement into C2a and C2b activates the classical pathway of complement activation."
