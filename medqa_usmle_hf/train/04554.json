The patient's presentation includes a fever, malaise, weakness, and a new systolic murmur, which suggests infective endocarditis. Given her history of recurrent bloody diarrhea and hyperemic rectal mucosa on sigmoidoscopy, she may have an underlying colon malignancy. Streptococcus gallolyticus is associated with both infectious endocarditis and colon malignancy. Candida albicans is not a common cause of infective endocarditis, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis are less commonly associated with endocarditis in general."
