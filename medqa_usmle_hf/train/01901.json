EGFR is a protein responsible for cell proliferation and is often overexpressed in cancer cells. Inhibition of EGFR can prevent tumor growth. ALK is a tyrosine kinase receptor that can be mutated in some cancers, but it is not the target of this drug. TNF-\u03b1 is a cytokine involved in inflammation and immune response, and CD52 is a protein expressed on lymphocytes. These are not directly involved in epithelial cell proliferation or organogenesis."
