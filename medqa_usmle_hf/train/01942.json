When the gallbladder is removed, a pathological evaluation is conducted on the tissue. The question asks for a correct statement about the tissue represented in the exhibit, but since we do not have access to the exhibit, we can use the process of elimination based on general knowledge. Goblet cells are not normally found in the gallbladder, so option D is incorrect. Area 1 is where bile is stored, not secreted, so option A is incorrect. Cholecystokinin activates, not inactivates, the cells in area 3, so option B is incorrect. Therefore, the correct option is C, which states that this section is taken from the site that does not adjoin liver. The gallbladder is not directly connected to the liver, but it does receive bile from the liver via the common bile duct."

However, we can make some educated guesses based on general knowledge of anatomy and histology. The gallbladder is a small organ that stores and releases bile produced by the liver. Therefore, it is likely that the cells in area 1 are involved in the production or secretion of bile. Cholecystokinin is a hormone that stimulates the contraction of the gallbladder and the release of bile. Therefore, it is unlikely that the cells in area 3 are inactivated by cholecystokinin. Since the gallbladder is located adjacent to the liver, it is unlikely that the section shown in the exhibit does not adjoin the liver. Goblet cells are specialized epithelial cells that secrete mucus. They are typically found in the lining of the digestive tract, but are not present in the gallbladder. Therefore, it is correct to say that there should not be goblet cells among the cells in area 1."

However, we can provide some general guidance on how to approach questions like this. First, carefully read the question stem and identify any clues that may help you narrow down the answer choices. In this case, the fact that the patient had a gallbladder that was removed may help you eliminate some answer choices that are not relevant to the question. Second, carefully read each answer choice and identify any that are obviously incorrect. Finally, review each remaining answer choice and choose the one that best answers the question. In this case, we cannot provide a specific answer since we do not have access to the exhibit, but we encourage you to practice this method with other questions to improve your test-taking skills."

However, we can still refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for assistance. \n\nFrom what is provided in the question stem, we know that the patient had his gallbladder removed, and the pathologist is examining a slide of the removed gallbladder. \n\n(A) The function of the cells in area 1 is to secrete bile: This statement is incorrect. Area 1 is not defined, and we cannot make any assumptions about its function. However, it is worth noting that bile is typically secreted by hepatocytes in the liver, not cells in the gallbladder. \n\n(B) The cells in area 3 are inactivated by cholecystokinin: This statement is also incorrect, as we do not know what area 3 represents. However, it is true that cholecystokinin (CCK) plays a role in stimulating the gallbladder to contract and release bile into the small intestine. \n\n(C) This section is taken from the site which does not adjoin liver: This statement is correct. The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped sac that is located beneath the liver. While it is connected to the liver and bile ducts, it is a separate structure and does not \"adjoin\" the liver in the way that, say, two organs that are physically connected would. \n\n(D) Normally, there should be goblet cells among the cells in area 1: This statement is incorrect, as we do not know what area 1 represents. However, it is worth noting that goblet cells are typically found in the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, where they secrete mucus to protect and lubricate the epithelial cells. They are not typically found in the gallbladder. \n\nOverall, it seems that the correct answer to this question is (C), based on the information provided in the stem."
