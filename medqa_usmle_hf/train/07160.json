This can lead to inflammation and damage in the kidney. The immune complexes are formed when antibodies (usually IgG) bind to self-antigens, such as nuclear antigens, which are often present in lupus. It is important to rule out lupus nephritis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, as it can lead to significant kidney damage if left untreated."

A renal biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis and treatment planning."
