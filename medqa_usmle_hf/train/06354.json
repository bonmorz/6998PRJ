During anaphylaxis, there is an increase in ventilation rate and tidal volume, which leads to hyperventilation and a decrease in alveolar pCO2. At the same time, there is an increase in capillary permeability, which can lead to a decrease in oxygen saturation and an increase in shunt and dead space ventilation. This leads to an increase in alveolar pO2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) decreased alveolar pCO2 and increased alveolar pO2."
