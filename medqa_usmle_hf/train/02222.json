Since the wound did not cross the midline, the most likely finding is ipsilateral flaccid paralysis at the level of the lesion. Loss of pain and temperature sensation is associated with damage to the anterolateral system, contralateral loss of tactile, vibration, and proprioception is associated with the dorsal columns, and contralateral spasticity is associated with the corticospinal tract."

Loss of pain and temperature sensation is carried by the spinothalamic tract, which crosses the midline at the level of the spinal cord, so it would not be affected. Tactile, vibration, and proprioception are carried by the dorsal columns, which cross over in the medulla oblongata, so this would not be affected either. Spasticity is commonly associated with upper motor neuron lesions, whereas flaccid paralysis is associated with lower motor neuron lesions, which is more likely in this case. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) ipsilateral flaccid paralysis at the level of the lesion."

If the wound entered the spinal cord but did not cross the midline, the patient would exhibit symptoms on the same side as the wound, which would be ipsilateral. The loss of motor function would cause flaccid paralysis, making option (D) the correct answer. Option (A) describes symptoms of a lesion that crossed the midline, while both options (B) and (C) describe symptoms of a lesion on the opposite side of the wound."

In this condition, there will be ipsilateral flaccid paralysis at the level of the lesion due to damage to the anterior horn cells and the descending motor tracts. There will also be ipsilateral loss of tactile, vibration, and proprioception sensation below the lesion due to damage to the dorsal columns. Finally, there will be contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation below the lesion due to damage to the spinothalamic tract as it crosses the midline. Therefore, option (A) and (B) are incorrect. Option (C) is also incorrect because spasticity would occur below the level of the lesion, rather than being contralateral."

If this wound entered the spinal cord but did not cross the midline, it would likely result in ipsilateral flaccid paralysis at the level of the lesion. Option A is incorrect because loss of pain and temperature sensation is associated with damage to the lateral spinothalamic tract, which crosses the midline shortly after entering the cord. Option B is incorrect because loss of tactile, vibration, and proprioception is associated with damage to the posterior columns, which also cross the midline shortly after entering the cord. Option C is incorrect because spasticity is associated with damage to the corticospinal tract, which originates in the motor cortex and descends through the spinal cord. However, this tract also crosses the midline shortly after entering the cord, so damage on one side would not result in contralateral spasticity."
