The elevated plasma metanephrine levels further support this diagnosis. Phenoxybenzamine should be given to the patient to control his hypertension before surgical removal of the adrenal mass. This medication is an alpha-adrenergic blocker that works by blocking the effects of catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, which are produced by pheochromocytomas. This can help to prevent severe hypertension, tachycardia, and other adverse cardiovascular events during surgery. Once blood pressure is controlled, the patient can undergo resection of the adrenal mass. Propranolol and metoprolol are beta-blockers, which are contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma as they can potentially worsen hypertension by unopposed alpha effects from catecholamines. Resection should not be performed until blood pressure is controlled."

The elevated plasma metanephrines also support this diagnosis. The presence of a mass in the left adrenal gland on CT scan further supports the diagnosis. The initial treatment of pheochromocytoma involves alpha-blockade therapy with phenoxybenzamine to manage hypertension and prevent catecholamine-induced hypertensive crisis during surgery. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient would be to start treatment with phenoxybenzamine. Resection of the adrenal mass would be the definitive treatment but should be delayed until the patient's blood pressure is controlled. The use of beta-blockers like propranolol or metoprolol before adequate alpha-blockade can lead to unopposed alpha-receptor stimulation, leading to paradoxical hypertension and an increased risk of hypertensive crisis. Therefore, beta-blockers should only be considered after adequate alpha-blockade has been achieved."
