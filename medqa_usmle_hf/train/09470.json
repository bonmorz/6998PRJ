Tenderness to palpation, pain when lying on the affected side, and pain with resisted abduction are all associated with greater trochanteric pain syndrome. X-ray of the pelvis showing no abnormalities eliminates the possibility of acetabular or femoral head pathology. Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve involvement would present with sensory symptoms rather than the pain described by the patient."
