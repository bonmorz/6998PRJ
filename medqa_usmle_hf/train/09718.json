The laboratory work reveals an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, which confirms the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Therefore, the most likely lab finding to be abnormal in this patient is anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, which are commonly found in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. Anti-DNA topoisomerase antibodies and anti-nuclear antibodies are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, while anti-histidyl-tRNA synthetase antibodies are associated with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. None of these conditions are strongly suggested by the patient's history or physical exam."

The patient has symptoms of depression and fatigue, and also has a history of joint pain and a resolved skin rash, suggesting a possible autoimmune disorder such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. The laboratory work, however, does not show any abnormalities in the CBC or liver function tests, making options A, B, and C less likely. The elevated TSH suggests potential hypothyroidism, but the lab value is not significantly high, so this option is also less likely. The most likely abnormality to be seen in autoimmune disorders is the presence of specific antibodies against self-antigens, such as anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Therefore, the correct answer is (D)."
