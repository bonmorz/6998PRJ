The patient\u2019s current condition, with hyperthermia and muscle rigidity, is consistent with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a rare but serious side effect of antipsychotic medication."

The patient was given an emergency medication to calm down, which suggests that he was experiencing an acute psychotic episode. The subsequent development of weakness, confusion, and profuse sweating, along with high fever, suggests that the medication caused serotonin syndrome, which is often caused by drugs that increase serotonin signaling or inhibit its reuptake, such as SSRIs or SNRIs. Therefore, the most likely mechanism of action of the drug is dopamine receptor blocking, as drugs such as antipsychotics, which are used to treat acute psychosis, often work by blocking dopamine receptors. However, without more information about the specific drug that was given, this cannot be confirmed with certainty."
