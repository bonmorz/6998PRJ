The symptoms suggest streptococcus pyogenes infection, which can cause a rash and swelling with sharply defined borders, as well as fever and elevated heart rate. The narrow red line could indicate lymphangitis, which is a common feature of streptococcal infections. Sporothrix schenckii infection can cause a similar rash, but it usually appears as a lesion at the site of trauma and progresses slowly. Contact dermatitis tends to cause a more diffuse rash, while vasculitis presents with palpable purpura and other signs of systemic inflammation."
