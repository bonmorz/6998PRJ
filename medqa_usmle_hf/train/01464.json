The presentation suggests acute cellular rejection of the transplanted organ, which is mediated by recipient T-cells attacking the foreign antigens on the transplant. Preformed recipient antibodies would cause hyperacute rejection, donor antibodies would cause humoral (antibody-mediated) rejection, and deposition of antibody immune complexes would cause acute or chronic antibody-mediated rejection, all of which have different presentations."

The transplantation introduces foreign cells and tissues to the recipient's immune system, which may recognize them as foreign and launch an attack. T-cells are responsible for delayed type hypersensitivity reactions and the involvement of the kidney's endothelial cells suggests inflammatory cells are involved, indicating a cellular response rather than antibody response. Therefore, recipient T-cells are most likely responsible for this presentation."
