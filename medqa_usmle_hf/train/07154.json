Atenolol is a beta-blocker medication that can cause a decrease in blood pressure as well as a decrease in serum potassium levels. However, since the patient's potassium level is already within normal range, a significant decrease is unlikely. Atenolol can also cause hyponatremia, evidenced by a decrease in serum sodium levels. Therefore, the correct option is (A) Na+ 137 mEq/L. This would occur several weeks post-treatment as the patient's body adjusts to the medication. Option (B) is incorrect as the patient's potassium level is normal, and option (C) is incorrect as plasma triglyceride levels are not significantly affected by atenolol. Option (D) is incorrect as it suggests hypernatremia which is unlikely with atenolol treatment."
