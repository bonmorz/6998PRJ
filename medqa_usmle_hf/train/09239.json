The patient doesn't want hormonal contraception, and wants the possibility of becoming pregnant in the future, which rules out options B and D. Option C refers to barrier methods, which have lower effectiveness rates. Therefore, the most suitable option is A, inducing endometrial inflammation, which refers to the copper intrauterine device (IUD). The copper IUD works by preventing fertilization through the release of copper ions that interfere with sperm motility and survival, and also by inducing an inflammatory response that inhibits implantation."
