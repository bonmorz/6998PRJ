The gram-negative, comma-shaped, flagellated bacilli suggest a diagnosis of cholera, which is caused by an overactivation of adenylate cyclase, leading to luminal chloride hypersecretion and subsequent profuse watery diarrhea. Option A describes the mechanism of diarrhea in inflammatory bowel disease, not cholera. Option C describes the mechanism of diarrhea in neuropathic conditions such as diabetic neuropathy or Parkinson disease. Option D describes the mechanism of diarrhea in osmotic diarrheas, such as lactose intolerance or malabsorption syndromes."

Among the options, only option B describes a mechanism that can cause a hypersecretion of electrolytes and water, leading to diarrhea. The presence of gram-negative, comma-shaped, flagellated bacilli further supports the diagnosis of cholera, which is caused by Vibrio cholerae and produces the cholera toxin that overactivates adenylate cyclase in intestinal epithelial cells, leading to increased chloride secretion and water loss. Therapy with oral rehydration solution is appropriate to replace the lost fluids and electrolytes."
