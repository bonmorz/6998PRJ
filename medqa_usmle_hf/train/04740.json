The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of cholecystitis, which can cause obstruction of the bile duct and lead to increased levels of bilirubin (causing lighter colored stools and itchiness).

Scurvy is caused by vitamin C deficiency and is not related to the condition described for this patient. Therefore, the vitamin level least likely to be affected is vitamin A, associated with night blindness."

Scurvy is a deficiency of vitamin C, hemolytic anemia is a deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid, and increased prothrombin time and easy bleeding is a deficiency of vitamin K.
