The symptoms, especially the weakness when extending the left wrist against resistance and the dermatomal distribution of the paresthesias, suggest that the most likely cause is C5-C6 disc herniation. Carpal tunnel syndrome would not produce weakness in the wrist, and Syringomyelia would produce more widespread symptoms. Thoracic outlet syndrome might cause paresthesias in the upper extremity, but not weakness in the wrist. The positive brachioradialis reflex indicates a localized lesion to C5-C6 nerve root."

The weakness of the left wrist extension is consistent with this diagnosis. Nerve compression in other areas, such as the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome) or the thoracic outlet (thoracic outlet syndrome), would not cause these specific symptoms. Syringomyelia is a rare disorder that can lead to a range of neurological symptoms, but it is unlikely to be the cause of this patient\u2019s symptoms."

The patient describes symptoms of left neck, shoulder, and arm pain that radiates to the radial aspect of her left forearm, thumb, and index finger. When she extends and rotates her head to the left and downward pressure is applied, she reports paresthesias along the radial aspect of her left forearm and thumb. These symptoms suggest a C5-C6 disc herniation, which can lead to compression of the nerve roots that supply the upper limb. The weakness when extending the left wrist against resistance further supports this diagnosis."

The positive findings on physical examination also support this diagnosis. Carpal tunnel syndrome primarily affects the median nerve and does not involve weakness in wrist extension.

Thoracic outlet syndrome can also cause similar symptoms but is usually associated with vascular rather than neurological symptoms."
