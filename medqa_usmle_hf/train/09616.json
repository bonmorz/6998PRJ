The decreased TSH level suggests thyroid hormone excess, and the normal total T4 level with decreased free T4 level suggests decreased binding protein. Among the options, only estrogen regulates TBG secretion, leading to increased binding and decreased free T4 levels. Placental production of thyroxine is not significant until later in pregnancy. Progesterone may increase TBG production but would not cause decreased free T4 levels. Estrogen-mediated thyroid hyperplasia is not a recognized entity."
