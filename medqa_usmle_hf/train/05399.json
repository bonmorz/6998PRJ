The spirometry findings of an FEV1:FVC ratio of 65% and an FEV1 of 70% of predicted also support this diagnosis. DLCO can be decreased in emphysema due to destruction of the alveolar-capillary membrane. Pulmonary fibrosis is typically associated with restrictive spirometry patterns, and bronchial asthma is characterized by reversible airway obstruction. Bronchiectasis may cause chronic cough and sputum production but is not typically associated with expiratory wheezing."
