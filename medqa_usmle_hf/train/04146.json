Severe cerebral ischemia may cause slow progressive loss of function rather than the rapid onset described in the case. Increased number of CAG repeats is associated with Huntington's disease, which typically presents with chorea and cognitive decline, but the onset is usually gradual and the symptoms progress slowly over time."
