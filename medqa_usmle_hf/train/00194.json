The symptoms, including gradual loss of speech, vision, and motor skills, myoclonic seizures, hypertonicity, and brain atrophy, suggest a diagnosis of Krabbe disease. Krabbe disease is caused by a deficiency of \u03b2-Galactocerebrosidase, which leads to an accumulation of galactocerebroside and psychosine in the central and peripheral nervous systems, resulting in demyelination and neurodegeneration. Option A refers to Niemann-Pick disease, option B refers to metachromatic leukodystrophy, and option C refers to Gaucher disease, all of which can also cause demyelination and neurodegeneration, but with different underlying enzyme deficiencies."
