The mutation changes this start codon to 'UUG', which is still recognized by tRNA but is not the preferred start codon. This change may affect the binding of met-tRNA to the 60S complex, delaying the initiation of translation and potentially influencing the overall folding and function of the resulting protein. Therefore, the most likely process affected by this mutation is the binding of met-tRNA to the 60S complex."

The 'AUG' segment of mRNA is the start codon that signals the binding of met-tRNA to the 60S complex during translation initiation.

Therefore, the process most likely affected by this mutation is the binding of met-tRNA to the 60S complex."

The mutation from 'AUG' to 'UUG' results in a substitution of methionine to leucine in the protein sequence, but this mutation does not affect the catalyzation of peptide bond formation or cleavage of introns. However, the 'AUG' codon is used as the start codon for translation, and is recognized by the initiation factor eIF2, which recruits the met-tRNA to bind to the 60S ribosomal subunit. Therefore, the point mutation in the wingless fruit fly gene affects the binding of met-tRNA to the 60S complex and inhibits proper initiation of translation, resulting in abnormal wing bud formation during embryogenesis."
