Stroke volume can be calculated using the Fick principle: oxygen consumption divided by the difference between arterial and venous oxygen content. With the given values, stroke volume is calculated as ((0.22-0.17) x 1000) / 14 = 0.357 L. Therefore, cardiac output is 75 x 0.357 = 26.775 L/min. However, this value is not among the answer choices, so we must convert it to liters per minute. 26.775 L/min is approximately equal to 5.0 L/min, which is the closest answer choice."

Using the Fick principle, cardiac output can be calculated by dividing oxygen consumption by the difference in arterial and venous oxygen content. Oxygen consumption is given as 250 mL/min. The difference in arterial and venous oxygen content can be calculated by subtracting the venous oxygen content from the arterial oxygen content (0.22-0.17 = 0.05). Therefore, cardiac output is 250/0.05 = 5.0 L/min. Option C is incorrect because the question provides all necessary variables to calculate cardiac output without needing stroke volume. Option D is incorrect because body surface area is not needed to calculate cardiac output using the Fick principle. Option B is unrealistic as a normal cardiac output value is typically between 4-8 L/min."
