The defect described in the question suggests a failure of the maxillary and medial nasal prominences to fuse properly, resulting in a cleft lip. Cleft palate would result from a failure of the palatine shelves to fuse. Macrognathia refers to an abnormally large jaw and Torus palatinus refers to a bony growth on the hard palate, neither of which are directly related to the described defect in this question."

The other options are not typically associated with smoking during pregnancy."
