The patient's presentation is suggestive of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, with low serum sodium and potassium levels and high urinary sodium and potassium levels. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that increases urine output and can cause electrolyte imbalance, and its abuse is most likely responsible for the patient's presentation. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker, polyethylene glycol is a laxative, and amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic, none of which are likely to cause the symptoms described in the case."
