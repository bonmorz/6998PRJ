The patient's lack of symptoms other than amenorrhea can be explained by her obesity, as excess adipose tissue can produce estrogen and contribute to anovulation, leading to irregular menstrual cycles and ultimately amenorrhea. Breastfeeding can also suppress ovulation, but this patient's last pregnancy was several years ago, and she did not breastfeed for the entirety of the last 5 months. Smoking has been associated with premature menopause, but it is not the best explanation in this case as the patient's symptoms began 2 years ago, before any change in smoking status, and smoking status is not associated with irregular menstrual cycles or amenorrhea. Multiparity is also not the best explanation as the patient has had four successful pregnancies and breastfeeding is the factor that suppresses ovulation in this case."
