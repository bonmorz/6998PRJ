The patient has metabolic acidosis indicated by the low HCO3- level and a compensatory increase in respiratory rate indicated by the high respiratory rate. Among the options, only inability of the distal tubule to secrete H+ can cause such acidosis with normal anion gap, which is seen in this patient (calculated anion gap = Na+ \u2013 [Cl- + HCO3-] = 138 \u2013 [115 + 12] = 11). Impaired metabolism of branched-chain amino acids will cause elevated ammonia, which is not seen in this patient. Impaired CFTR gene function will cause cystic fibrosis, which presents with other symptoms such as pulmonary infections and pancreatic insufficiency. Deficiency of ornithine transcarbamylase will also cause elevated ammonia, which is not seen in this patient."
