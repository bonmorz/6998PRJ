This condition can be caused by a number of factors such as trauma, corticosteroids or idiopathic causes. The symptoms match as well, with pain that is aggravated when running, and limited internal rotation and abduction of the hip. There is no indication of a viral infection or immune-mediated synovial inflammation. An unstable proximal femoral growth plate is rare and typically only occurs in children under 6 years old."

The pain and limited range of motion of the right hip, along with tenderness in the right groin, suggest avascular necrosis of the femoral head. This may be due to decreased blood flow to the area caused by the preceding viral infection. The x-ray shows flattening of the femoral head, which is consistent with this diagnosis. Unstable growth plate, immune-mediated synovial inflammation, and viral infection are not the most likely underlying mechanisms based on the clinical presentation and x-ray findings."

Unstable proximal femoral growth plate is a possibility but less likely given the patient's age and symptoms. Immune-mediated synovial inflammation is not suggested by the physical examination findings or imaging, and the blood work is normal."
