In the exposed group, the incidence rate is 18/300 = 0.06, and in the unexposed group, the incidence rate is 11/500 = 0.022. Then, we calculate the attributable risk percent by subtracting the incidence rate of lung cancer in the unexposed group from that in the exposed group, and dividing by the incidence rate in the exposed group. [(0.06-0.022)/0.06] x 100% = 63.3%. So the answer is (D). This means that 63.3% of the lung cancer cases in the exposed group can be attributed to radon exposure."

Using the data given in the question, we can calculate that a = 18, b = 282, c = 11, and d = 489. Plugging in these values, we get ((18/(18+282)) - (11/(11+489))) x 100 = 63.3%.

In the unexposed population, 11 out of 500 patients developed lung cancer over the same period, giving an incidence rate of 2.2%. The difference in incidence rate is 6% - 2.2% = 3.8%.

We can calculate the relative risk by dividing the lung cancer incidence in the exposed group by the lung cancer incidence in the unexposed group: (18/300) / (11/500) = 1.4848. Plugging this value into the formula for ARP gives us: ARP = (1.4848 - 1) / 1.4848 x 100% = 0.3367 x 100% = 33.67%. However, this ARP is for the entire population, not just those exposed to radon. To calculate the ARP for only those exposed to radon, we first need to calculate the proportion of lung cancer cases attributable to radon in the exposed group: (18/300) - (11/500) = 0.056. This means that 5.6% of the lung cancer cases in the exposed group are attributable to radon. To convert this to an ARP, we use the formula: ARP = (0.056 / 0.0005) x 100% = 11.2 x 100% = 63.3%.
