Option B is unlikely as normal ejection fraction is not typical in heart failure. Option C and D describe dilated or hypertrophic cardiac chambers, which can occur in certain types of heart failure, but the description does not match the patient\u2019s symptoms and findings."

The bibasilar rales, distended jugular veins, and pitting edema in both lower extremities suggest that the left ventricular wall thickness is increased. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. Option (B) is incorrect because the patient presents with symptoms of heart failure, which suggests that the ejection fraction is decreased. Option (C) is incorrect because the patient's symptoms suggest that the heart chambers are dilated and the walls are thickened, not thin. Option (D) is incorrect because the patient has symptoms of heart failure, which suggests that the ejection fraction is decreased, and she presents with signs of diastolic dysfunction (rapid early diastolic filling and slow late diastolic filling)."

The patient has hypertension, a history of smoking, and family history of cardiovascular disease, which puts her at risk for left ventricular hypertrophy. The bibasilar rales, distended jugular veins, and pitting edema suggest congestive heart failure. 'Copper wiring' and 'cotton wool spots' are retinal findings that suggest hypertensive retinopathy, further supporting the diagnosis of hypertension-related cardiovascular disease. Option A is the most likely echocardiographic finding in this patient, as it describes a reduced ejection fraction, which is commonly seen in patients with heart failure and increased wall thickness. Option B describes a normal ejection fraction and normal wall thickness, which is less likely given the patient's history and presentation. Option C describes dilated chambers and thin walls, which is more commonly seen in dilated cardiomyopathy. Option D describes diastolic dysfunction, which can be seen in patients with hypertensive heart disease, but is less likely in the setting of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction."
