The visual field testing shows a loss of vision in the right temporal and left nasal fields, which suggest a homonymous hemianopsia. This is usually caused by an occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery, which supplies the occipital lobe responsible for vision. Impaired perfusion of the retina would cause a loss of vision in a more peripheral field. Macular degeneration would not cause a sudden loss of vision as described. Occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery would not involve the occipital lobe and would cause different symptoms."

The symptoms of decreased vision and worsening headaches, along with an irregular pulse, suggest a possible embolic event. The findings of visual field testing and the patient's medical history make posterior cerebral artery (PCA) occlusion the most likely cause of her symptoms. Occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery would affect the contralateral leg and pelvis, not the visual fields. Impaired perfusion of the retina would not typically cause these symptoms, and degeneration of the macula would not present with a visual field deficit."
