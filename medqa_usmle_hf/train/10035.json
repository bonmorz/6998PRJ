The patient\u2019s symptoms and lab results suggest a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease, which is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF). VWF binds to subendothelial collagen to help stop bleeding by promoting platelets to adhere to the site of injury. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer. A is incorrect because there is no component that only binds to nucleotide derivative. C is incorrect because the conversion of factor X is done by factor IXa. D is incorrect because an epoxide reductase is not involved in blood clotting."
