This is due to the facial nerve running through the gland and being at risk of damage during surgery. Hyperesthesia of the right ear lobe and hyperacusis of the right ear are both unlikely complications of parotid gland surgery. Impaired taste and sensation of the posterior 1/3 of the tongue may occur, but it is less common than lip paralysis."

Paralysis of the right lower lip is a common complication due to damage to the mandibular branch of the facial nerve during surgery.

Impaired taste and sensation of the posterior 1/3 of the tongue (D) is also less likely, as the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve, which is responsible for taste sensation of the posterior 1/3 of the tongue, is usually preserved during total parotidectomy."
