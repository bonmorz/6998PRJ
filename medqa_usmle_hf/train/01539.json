The location of the mass above the sella turcica suggests that it is a craniopharyngioma, which is derived from remnants of the oral ectoderm.

The neurohypophysis is the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, and paraxial mesoderm gives rise to the musculoskeletal system. None of these are related to the location or characteristics of the described mass."
