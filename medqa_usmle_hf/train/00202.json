The patient\u2019s symptoms, including dull aching abdominal pain that worsens with meals, nausea, and occasional vomiting, suggest pancreatitis. The dark hyperpigmentation of the axillary skin indicates long-standing diabetes mellitus with associated conditions such as pancreatitis. The laboratory results also show high triglycerides and HbA1c, which are risk factors for pancreatitis. Cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis may present with similar symptoms, but the presence of recurrent hospitalizations and the laboratory results suggest pancreatitis as the most likely diagnosis. Duodenal peptic ulcer may also present with similar symptoms but is less likely given the patient\u2019s prior hospitalizations and diabetes status."

The symptoms of dull aching pain that worsens with meals, radiates to the back, and is associated with nausea and vomiting are commonly seen in acute pancreatitis. The elevated HbA1c, high triglyceride level, and low HDL cholesterol suggest uncontrolled diabetes and its associated complications, including pancreatitis. The dark hyperpigmentation of the axillary skin may be indicative of acanthosis nigricans, which is associated with insulin resistance and diabetes. The absence of jaundice and the normal liver function tests rule out cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis. Duodenal ulcers typically present with burning or gnawing epigastric pain that is relieved by food."

Hyperpigmentation of axillary skin is due to increased ACTH secretion and is seen in cases of chronic glucocorticoid use or adrenal insufficiency, which can also contribute to pancreatitis.
