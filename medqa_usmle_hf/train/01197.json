Among the options, C is the most likely heart sound, which indicates aortic stenosis with an ejection murmur that radiates to the carotids and is loudest at the right upper sternal border. A is incorrect because an opening snap follows an S2, not S1. B is incorrect because an early diastolic murmur occurs at the aortic or pulmonary valve and is not high pitched. D is incorrect because mid-systolic click is associated with mitral valve prolapse, which is not indicated in this case."
