The physical examination findings such as bilateral jugular venous distention, crackles at the lower lobes, and a pansystolic grade 2/6 murmur over the tricuspid area also support cocaine-induced pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure. Duloxetine overdose is unlikely given the patient's prescribed dose and history of depression. Acute viral hepatitis and coronary atherosclerosis do not explain the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings."
