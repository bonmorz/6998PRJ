The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest diabetes insipidus, which is a disorder of water balance that causes excessive thirst and excretion of large amounts of dilute urine. A desmopressin test is done to distinguish between central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In central diabetes insipidus, desmopressin can increase urine osmolality. An increase to 400 mOsm/L following vasopressin administration would be most consistent with a diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus."
