It works by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for the degradation of incretins, which in turn increase insulin secretion and decrease glucagon secretion. It can be used along with metformin for better glycemic control. Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone are thiazolidinediones, which can cause weight gain and also have associated risks of heart failure and bone fractures. Glyburide is a sulfonylurea, which can cause weight gain and hypoglycemia."
