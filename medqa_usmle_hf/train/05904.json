The patient has dyslipidemia with high total cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, and elevated triglycerides, which puts him at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, are the first-line therapy for dyslipidemia and have been shown to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors, bile acid resins, and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 inhibitors are alternative agents that may be used in certain cases, but HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are the most appropriate first-line therapy for this patient."
