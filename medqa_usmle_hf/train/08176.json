Non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the best imaging tool to diagnose and locate the obstructing stone. Contrast CT is not recommended in patients with acute kidney injury or suspected allergic reactions to contrast agents. Renal ultrasound is not the best initial imaging study for renal colic, but it can be considered to localize the stone if CT is not available or contraindicated. Supine abdominal radiograph is less sensitive and specific than CT for diagnosing renal colic."

The symptoms and physical examination findings suggest renal colic, and a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast is the initial imaging study of choice. Renal ultrasound is less sensitive than CT and is not sufficient to rule out other causes of flank pain. A contrast CT would be indicated if there is concern for obstruction or infection, but should be avoided in cases of suspected renal colic due to the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. A supine abdominal radiograph is not sensitive or specific enough to diagnose renal colic."
