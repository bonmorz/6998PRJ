Post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies includes both a killed vaccine and rabies immune globulin injected as soon as possible after exposure. Option A is the correct answer as it refers to the killed vaccine, which is given within ten days of exposure. Option B refers to oseltamivir, a medication used to treat influenza. Option C refers to venom antiserum, used to treat snake and spider bites. Option D refers to doxycycline, used prophylactically for tick-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease."
