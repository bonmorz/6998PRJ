The ECG findings, ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF and reciprocal segment depression in leads V1\u2013V6, suggest an acute posterior myocardial infarction. The tissue plasminogen activator was given to dissolve the clot that was blocking the flow of blood to the heart muscle. However, after 6 hours of therapy, the patient\u2019s condition starts to deteriorate, and the ECG shows accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which eventually changes to ventricular fibrillation. This can be caused by the formation of free radicals that can cause damage to the heart muscles, leading to arrhythmias and ischemia."
