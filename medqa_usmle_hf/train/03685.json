The symptoms presented by the patient are consistent with Tetralogy of Fallot, which is caused by an anterosuperior displacement of the aorticopulmonary septum. This results in a ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and overriding aorta. The bluish hue to the skin is due to cyanosis caused by the decrease in pulmonary blood flow. Squatting increases pulmonary blood flow, which relieves the symptoms temporarily."

The symptoms described in the question suggest Tetralogy of Fallot, which is caused by anterosuperior displacement of the aorticopulmonary septum during embryonic development. This displacement causes a narrowing of the pulmonary artery (pulmonary stenosis), a ventricular septal defect, an overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Squatting can increase systemic vascular resistance and decrease right-to-left shunting, improving symptoms temporarily. Failure of the aorticopulmonary septum to spiral or partial development would not cause Tetralogy of Fallot, and the failure of the ductus arteriosus to obliterate would lead to patent ductus arteriosus, not Tetralogy of Fallot."
