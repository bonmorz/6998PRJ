Hydrogen and ionic bonds are important for protein stability, but they are not typically targeted by drugs or plant extracts.

The extract causes endoplasmic reticulum stress and transduces proliferation signals, which suggest that it is targeting a type of bond involved in protein folding and structure. Only covalent bonds between carboxyl and amino groups are involved in peptide bonds, which form the backbone of proteins. The inability of chaperones to recover function also suggests a covalent bond disruption rather than weaker types of bonds such as hydrogen or ionic. The sulfide bond option is unlikely because there is no indication that the protein contains sulfur-containing residues."

The plant extract causes widespread endoplasmic reticulum stress and targets an important member of a protein complex that transduces proliferation signals. When the protein alone is exposed to the plant extract, its function is not recovered by the addition of chaperones. This suggests that the extract is targeting covalent bonds between carboxyl and amino groups in the protein, as this type of bond is critical for protein function and stability. The other options (hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, covalent bond between two sulfide groups) are less likely to be specifically targeted by the plant extract in this context."
