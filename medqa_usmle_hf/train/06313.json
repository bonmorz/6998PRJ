The symptoms, smoking history, and family history suggest peripheral arterial disease, most likely caused by a thromboembolism or atherosclerosis. Smoking cessation is the most important intervention to reduce the risk of amputation, as smoking is a major risk factor for peripheral artery disease. While bypass grafting and enoxaparin therapy may be necessary in some cases, they are not the most appropriate first-line intervention in this patient. Simvastatin may be used to lower cholesterol and prevent atherosclerosis, but it is not the most immediate intervention needed to reduce the risk of amputation."
