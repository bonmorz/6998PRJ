The clinical presentation with jaundice, direct hyperbilirubinemia, and increased alkaline phosphatase along with positive antimitochondrial and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies suggest primary biliary cirrhosis, which is caused by destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts. Idiopathic hepatocellular accumulation of fat (also called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) may cause elevation of liver enzymes, but not the hyperbilirubinemia in this patient. Neoplasia of the ampulla of Vater would not explain the positive autoimmune serology. Inflammation and fibrosis of the biliary tree may cause hyperbilirubinemia and elevation of alkaline phosphatase but would not explain the positive autoimmune serology."
