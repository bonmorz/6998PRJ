The muscle cramps and weakness may be a side effect of hydrochlorothiazide, and the elevated blood pressure suggests that the patient needs another antihypertensive medication. Among the options, eplerenone is less likely to cause muscle cramps and weakness as a side effect compared to hydralazine or nifedipine. Torsemide is also a diuretic and may have similar side effects to hydrochlorothiazide. The ECG is not relevant to the answer."
