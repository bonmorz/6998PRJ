The recent diagnosis of Salmonella gastroenteritis and the patient\u2019s use of ciprofloxacin suggest the possibility of an adverse medication effect (tendinopathy or tendon rupture). The symptoms of pain and swelling in the ankle, as well as the absence of plantar flexion, are consistent with Achilles tendon rupture, which can be a complication of fluoroquinolone use. Crystal formation or bacterial seeding are less likely given the absence of joint effusion or erythema."

Based on the patient\u2019s recent diagnosis of Salmonella gastroenteritis and medication list, it is possible that her left ankle pain is due to an adverse medication effect. Ciprofloxacin, used to treat bacterial infections, can cause tendon inflammation and even rupture in rare cases. The calf squeeze test does not elicit plantar flexion, which is suggestive of a possible tendon or nerve injury. Crystal formation within the joint (gout or pseudogout) and bacterial seeding are less likely given the absence of joint swelling, redness, or warmth."
