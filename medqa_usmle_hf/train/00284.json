The presence of a neck swelling that moves with swallowing, along with symptoms of throbbing headache, sweating, and palpitations, suggests a possible thyroid tumor secreting excess thyroid hormone (thyrotoxicosis) or a pheochromocytoma. The normal TSH level rules out thyroid hormone secretion as the cause, making option C incorrect. Increased serum cortisol would suggest Cushing's disease, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation, making option B incorrect. Increased serum gastrin would suggest Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation. The high levels of calcitonin suggest a possible medullary thyroid carcinoma, but this is not directly relevant to the patient's current presentation. The most likely diagnosis, based on symptoms and laboratory findings, is a pheochromocytoma, which can cause elevated plasma metanephrines. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
