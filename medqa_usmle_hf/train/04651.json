The symptoms of disorganized speech, delusions, and agitation suggest a brief psychotic disorder, which is characterized by a sudden onset of psychotic symptoms that last less than a month. Other options would require a longer duration of symptoms, such as schizophrenia (at least 6 months) or schizophreniform disorder (between 1 and 6 months). Schizotypal personality disorder would be a longstanding, pervasive pattern of behavior and thinking, not associated with acute psychotic symptoms."

The symptoms described in the question are characteristic of brief psychotic disorder, which involves a sudden onset of psychotic symptoms that usually resolve within one month.

Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient is brief psychotic disorder."

The patient's return to baseline after three days and not presenting with symptoms for one month supports this diagnosis.
