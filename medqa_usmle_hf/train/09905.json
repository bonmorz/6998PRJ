The history and physical examination findings suggest spondylolisthesis, which is a condition where a vertebra slips forward and out of place. The waddling gait and pain radiating down the leg suggest nerve compression, which is common in spondylolisthesis. Facet joint syndrome and disc herniation can cause back pain but generally do not result in a waddling gait or nerve compression symptoms. Overuse injury can also cause back pain but is less likely in this age group and does not explain the other symptoms."

The patient's symptoms, including back pain that worsens with exercise, a waddling gait, and radiating pain down the leg, suggest Spondylolisthesis. The displacement of the vertebrae at different levels is a characteristic feature of this condition. Facet joint syndrome may cause back pain, but it does not typically cause radiating pain or gait abnormalities. A disc herniation may cause radiating pain, but it is not typically associated with waddling gait or displacement of vertebrae. Overuse injury is a general term that does not specifically describe the patient's symptoms."
