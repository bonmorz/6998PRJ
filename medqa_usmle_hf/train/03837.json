The CT finding of an irregular walled-off fluid collection suggests that the patient has developed an abscess. Antibiotics and CT-guided drainage should be initiated to treat the abscess.

An immediate appendectomy or early surgical drainage is not appropriate in this case as it may increase the risk of complications such as wound infection and intra-abdominal abscess."

However, the presence of a walled-off fluid collection indicates that the appendix may have perforated or ruptured, making it difficult to determine the extent of the infection. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is antibiotics and CT-guided drainage to control the infection and reduce inflammation in the area. Once the infection has been controlled, a subsequent interval appendectomy can be performed to prevent future episodes of appendicitis. Options B and C are not appropriate because a prompt appendectomy is indicated only when the diagnosis of appendicitis is clear, which is not the case in this patient. Option D is not ideal because early surgical drainage can increase the risk of infection spread and is not necessary in the majority of cases."
