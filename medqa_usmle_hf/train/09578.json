Yersinia enterocolitica is a common cause of bloody diarrhea in young people and can be transmitted through contact with animals. The normal abdominal exam suggests that the infection may be limited to the intestines. The blood test shows an elevated WBC count with a predominantly neutrophilic response, which is consistent with a bacterial infection. C. difficle colitis typically presents with watery diarrhea and abdominal tenderness. Bacillus cereus infection can cause food poisoning, but typically presents with vomiting. Rotavirus infection typically presents with vomiting and watery diarrhea without blood."
