The patient's symptoms suggest septic arthritis, and arthrocentesis confirmed leukocytosis with predominantly neutrophils. The most appropriate next step is to administer intravenous antibiotics and repeat arthrocentesis. Option A is not sufficient for the patient\u2019s condition. Option C involves administering an NSAID that could mask the symptoms of infection and is not appropriate treatment for septic arthritis. Option D is used for gout, which is not the likely diagnosis in this case."

Thus, the most appropriate next step would be to administer intravenous antibiotics and repeat arthrocentesis to monitor response to treatment. Option A is incorrect because it is not appropriate to administer just oral antibiotics, given the severity of the joint involvement. Option C is incorrect because a radiograph is unlikely to be helpful in this situation, and indomethacin is not appropriate given the potential for worsening infection. Option D is incorrect because colchicine is not indicated in the treatment of septic joints."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including knee swelling and pain, erythema and edema, and warm knee to the touch, indicate septic arthritis. Arthrocentesis confirmed the diagnosis, and the presence of high leukocyte counts and neutrophils indicate that the infection is bacterial and requires antibiotics. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to administer intravenous antibiotics and repeat arthrocentesis to monitor response to treatment. Option A and D are incorrect as they do not address the bacterial infection. Option C is incorrect since the patient has septic arthritis and indomethacin is not an appropriate treatment for an infection."

Administering oral antibiotics alone or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like naproxen or indomethacin may not adequately treat the infection. Colchicine is not indicated for septic arthritis."
