The patient's symptoms suggest puerperal sepsis, which is usually caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, or anaerobic bacteria. Initial management should include IV antibiotics such as clindamycin and gentamicin until specific organism and sensitivities are known. Hysterectomy or dilation and curettage may be necessary if infection cannot be controlled, but are not the initial steps in management. Heparin infusion is not indicated in this case."

Based on the laboratory studies, the leukocyte count is elevated, suggesting infection, and the D-dimer level is within the reference range, ruling out deep vein thrombosis. Since pelvic ultrasonography shows an empty uterus, a D&C would not be appropriate. Hysterectomy would be an extreme measure and not appropriate at this stage. Heparin infusion is not necessary based on the D-dimer level. The most appropriate next step would be IV clindamycin and gentamicin to treat the suspected infection."
