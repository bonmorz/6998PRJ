The question is asking about the primary mechanism of DNA repair responsible for preventing radiation-induced damage to neighboring neurons, so we can eliminate options A, B, and C, which are not related to repair of double-strand breaks in DNA. Nonhomologous end joining repair is the mechanism responsible for repairing double-strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation, which can occur in neurons adjacent to the site of radiotherapy. Therefore, the correct answer is (D)."
