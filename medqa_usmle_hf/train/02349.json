Atropine can treat some of the symptoms, but muscular spasms are unresponsive. Pralidoxime can reactivate cholinesterase and reverse the toxic effects of cholinesterase inhibitors, making it the most appropriate choice. Carbachol and physostigmine are cholinergic agonists and will only worsen the symptoms. Pancuronium is a neuromuscular blocker and can exacerbate respiratory depression."

Pralidoxime is an antidote that can reverse the effects of cholinergic toxicity by reactivating cholinesterase enzymes.
