The symptoms, laboratory studies, and peripheral blood smear suggest the most likely diagnosis is acute myelogenous leukemia.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia presents with increased leukocyte count with immature cells, but not with thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, or the specific cytoplasmic inclusions. Hairy cell leukemia also presents with thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly, but the peripheral blood smear shows abnormal lymphocytes, not immature cells with specific cytoplasmic inclusions like the case presented."

The presence of multiple pinpoint, red, nonblanching spots on his extremities suggests petechiae, which can occur due to low platelet counts. The spleen enlargement suggests splenomegaly, which can occur as a result of increased blood cell production in leukemia."
