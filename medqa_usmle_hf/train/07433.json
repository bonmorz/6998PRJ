Option B is correct as Peyer's patches are known to be a site of entry for certain microorganisms, including Salmonella typhi. Option A is incorrect as Peyer's patches are found in the small intestine, not the colon. Option C is incorrect as Peyer's patches are actually largest in adolescence rather than infancy. Option D is incorrect as Peyer's patches are a normal part of the intestinal wall, not something that only appears in case of bacterial infection."

Bacterial infection can cause inflammation of the Peyer's patches, but they are not exclusive to bacterial infection. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."
