At the point where airway pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure, the intrapleural pressure in the chest wall will be at its lowest point (most negative). This will reduce the resistance to blood flow in the pulmonary vasculature and therefore decrease pulmonary vascular resistance, making option (B) the correct answer. The transmural pressure of the lung-chest wall system is the difference between the intrapleural pressure and the transpulmonary pressure, so it will not necessarily be at its maximum or minimum at this point."

When the airway pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure, it is called functional residual capacity (FRC).

The transmural pressure of the lung-chest wall system is also at a minimum, as the outward recoil of the lungs is equal to the inward recoil of the chest wall. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."
