In low-oxygen conditions, the body switches to anaerobic metabolism, producing ATP through glycolysis, which eventually results in the production of lactate. Lactate dehydrogenase is the enzyme responsible for converting pyruvate to lactate, and its activation can explain the longer utilization of glucose before cell death and the acidification of the culture medium. The other enzymes listed are involved in other metabolic pathways and are unlikely to be responsible for these effects."

The fact that the cultures show longer utilization of glucose before reaching a plateau and cell death, along with significant acidification of the culture medium, suggests an increase in anaerobic glycolysis. Lactate dehydrogenase is responsible for the conversion of pyruvate to lactate during anaerobic conditions, causing acidification. Therefore, an activating effect on lactate dehydrogenase would explain these results."

The combination of low-oxygen and vigorous contraction leads to anaerobic glycolysis, which leads to lactate production by pyruvate.
