The hypothenar eminence and the little finger are innervated by ulnar nerve, so inability to extend the little finger at the proximal interphalangeal joint is the most likely additional finding. Loss of sensation over the palmar aspect of the middle finger is a sign of median nerve compression, while loss of sensation over the dorsum of the medial half of the hand is a sign of ulnar nerve compression at the wrist or elbow. Inability to flex the index finger at the interphalangeal joints is a sign of median nerve compression."

Loss of sensation over the dorsum of the medial half of the hand and loss of sensation over the palmar aspect of the middle finger are signs of median nerve and ulnar nerve compression, respectively. Inability to flex the index finger at the interphalangeal joints is a sign of flexor digitorum profundus weakness, which is not associated with ulnar nerve compression."

The symptoms suggest a potential diagnosis of cyclist's palsy, which is caused by compression of the ulnar nerve at the wrist. The hyperflexion of the right thumb interphalangeal joint is known as the Froment sign, which is associated with weakness of the adductor pollicis muscle, a muscle supplied by the ulnar nerve. Option (A) is associated with dysfunction of the flexor digitorum profundus muscle of the index finger, which is supplied by the median nerve. Option (B) is associated with dysfunction of the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve. Option (C) is associated with dysfunction of the palmar digital branch of the median nerve.

The patient has symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of ulnar nerve compression at the wrist, also known as Guyon's canal syndrome.

Inability to extend the little finger at the proximal interphalangeal joint in option D is also consistent with ulnar nerve compression at the wrist since the ulnar nerve innervates the hypothenar muscles and the muscles responsible for extension of the little finger."
