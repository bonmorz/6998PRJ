The small hard mass over the right mandible is indicative of osteoma, which is a feature of Gardner\u2019s syndrome. Lynch\u2019s syndrome is associated with colorectal cancer, but not necessarily with multiple polyps. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome also involves polyps but typically presents with mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation. Turcot\u2019s syndrome is associated with malignant brain tumors and colonic polyps, but it is less commonly associated with FAP."

The presence of numerous polyps and a family history of colon cancer suggest Gardner\u2019s syndrome. Lynch\u2019s syndrome is also associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer but is characterized by a specific pattern of inheritance and a specific set of cancers. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is characterized by the development of hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and pigmented spots on the lips and oral mucosa.
