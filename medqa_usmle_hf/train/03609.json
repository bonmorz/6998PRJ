The presence of a complex renal calculus in the right kidney also supports the diagnosis of struvite stones."

Xanthine stones are uncommon and associated with rare metabolic disorders. Uric acid stones form in acidic urine and are associated with conditions that increase the production of uric acid. Cystine stones are rare and are associated with a genetic disorder that affects the transport of amino acids in the kidneys."
