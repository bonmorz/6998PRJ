The symptoms and physical examination findings suggest pemphigus vulgaris, which is caused by antibodies against desmoglein-3, a cadherin protein found in desmosomes. Increased mitotic activity of basal and suprabasal cells is found in conditions such as epidermolysis bullosa and squamous cell carcinoma, but those are unlikely causes given this patient's presentation. Cutaneous T cell lymphoma and dermatophyte infection typically don't present with flaccid blisters and bullae that rupture easily."
