The exam findings of tenderness over specific points (i.e. tender points) also support this diagnosis. The absence of abnormalities in blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate supports the diagnosis of fibromyalgia over other options such as Polymyositis or Rheumatoid arthritis. Major depressive disorder may be comorbid with fibromyalgia but would not explain the specific tender points found on examination."
