The advertisement states that Noxbinle reduced the risk of HCC death by 10% compared to placebo. This means that the absolute risk reduction (ARR) is 0.1. To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), we use the formula 1/ARR. So, 1/0.1 = 10. Therefore, 10 patients need to be treated with Noxbinle 100 mg in order to prevent, on average, one death from HCC. Therefore, the correct answer is (D)."

The question is asking for the number needed to treat (NNT), which is calculated by the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction (ARR). The advertisement provides an ARR of 10% (1.5% mortality in the treatment group vs 11.5% mortality in the control group), so the NNT would be 1/0.1 or 10.

The advertisement does not provide the necessary data to calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) for Noxbinle in preventing HCC deaths. NNT is a measure of therapeutic effectiveness that indicates how many patients need to receive a treatment to prevent one additional bad outcome. It is calculated as the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is the difference between the control group's event rate and the treatment group's event rate. Without knowing these rates, we cannot calculate the ARR or the NNT."

The advertisement states that \"Noxbinle reduced HCC deaths by 10% compared to placebo.\" In other words, the relative risk reduction is 10%. To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), we use the formula NNT = 1 / (absolute risk reduction). To convert relative risk reduction to absolute risk reduction, we use the formula absolute risk reduction = (1 - relative risk reduction). Thus, absolute risk reduction = (1 - 0.10) = 0.90. Plugging this value into the NNT formula, we get NNT = 1 / 0.90, which is approximately 11.1. Since we cannot treat a fraction of a patient, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 11. Therefore, 11 patients need to be treated with Noxbinle 100 mg in order to prevent, on average, one death from HCC. The closest option is (D) 10, which is the correct answer."
