Therefore, there is a negative correlation between CRP and total cholesterol. As a result, the r value lies between 0 and -1. Option (A) is incorrect because a correlation of +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation. Option (B) is incorrect because the correlation is negative, not positive. Option (C) is incorrect because there is a correlation present, just a negative one."
