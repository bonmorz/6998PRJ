The symptoms of foul-smelling diarrhea, abdominal cramps, vomiting, fever, and dehydration indicate a viral gastroenteritis. Among the options, rotavirus is known to cause diarrhea in children and can be prevented by vaccination. The lack of blood cells, pus, and ova or parasites in the stool examination also supports a viral etiology rather than parasitic (Cryptosporidiosis) or bacterial (Norovirus infection) causes. Irritable bowel syndrome is unlikely given the acute onset and presence of systemic symptoms."

Norovirus infection can cause vomiting and diarrhea, but it is not typically associated with foul-smelling stool."
