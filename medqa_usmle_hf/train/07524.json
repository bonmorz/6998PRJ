The genetic abnormality suggests Angelman syndrome, and the clinical features, such as developmental delay, cognitive disability, uncoordinated movements, and inappropriate laughter, support this diagnosis. Angelman syndrome is caused by the deletion or inactivation of genes on the maternally inherited chromosome 15. Therefore, the most likely pattern of gene expression in this patient is abnormally decreased expression of the gene from the maternal chromosome."

Since the patient has an abnormality in an E3 ubiquitin ligase gene, which functions in the removal of proteins, it suggests that the protein levels of certain molecules may be abnormal in this patient. This type of genetic abnormality is known as an imprinting disorder and would result in differential gene expression depending on whether the gene was inherited from the mother or father. Therefore, option (B), abnormally decreased expression of the gene from the maternal chromosome, is most likely seen in this patient. This is because some genes are imprinted, meaning only one allele is expressed, and in this case, the maternal allele is silenced."
