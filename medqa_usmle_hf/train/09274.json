During the primary survey of a trauma patient, the priority is to identify and address any life-threatening conditions. In this case, the known history of gross contamination with an unknown chemical suggests that decontamination should be the first priority. Brushing off the gross amount of the unknown chemical and removing all of the patient\u2019s clothes is the most appropriate choice. It is important to prevent further exposure to the chemical and limit the extent of damage to the skin. Taking a sample of the unknown substance and sending it to the lab for stat identification is important, but it should be done after the patient has been stabilized.
