The symptoms suggest a pulmonary contusion, which is a lung injury that results in bleeding and inflammation within the lung tissue. The coarse breath sounds over the right lung base and patchy, irregular infiltrates on the x-ray of the chest support this diagnosis. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a low oxygen saturation and a low HCO3- level, which can occur with pulmonary contusion. Pneumothorax would cause a sudden onset of shortness of breath and decreased breath sounds, but the symptoms in this case are more gradual. Pulmonary embolism would have a different pattern of infiltrates on chest x-ray and would present with sudden onset dyspnea. Aspiration pneumonia would have a different presentation on chest x-ray and would likely have a history of aspiration."

This presentation is not consistent with pneumothorax because the patient has coarse breath sounds and no evidence of collapsed lung on the x-ray. Pulmonary embolism and aspiration pneumonia are less likely given the patient\u2019s history and presentation."
