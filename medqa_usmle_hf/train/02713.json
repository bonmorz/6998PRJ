The symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with von Recklinghausen disease, also known as neurofibromatosis type 1. This disease is characterized by multiple flat hyperpigmented spots, axillary freckling, and the presence of neurofibromas. The exhibit does not show any abnormalities consistent with Sturge-Weber disease, such as a port-wine stain over the face. Tuberous sclerosis is also characterized by skin findings, such as ash-leaf spots, but the presence of seizures is typically associated with cortical tubers rather than skin lesions. Neurofibromatosis type 2 is characterized by bilateral acoustic neuromas, which are not observed in this patient."
