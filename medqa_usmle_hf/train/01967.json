An ecological study investigates the correlation between exposure to risk or protective factors and the outcome of interest at a group or population level. In this case, the investigators examined the correlation between per capita income and rates of syphilis in different cities, making it an ecological study. Case-control studies compare individuals with a certain condition to those without the condition. Case series describe the characteristics of a group of patients with a specific condition. Double-blind clinical trials are experimental studies that involve giving different treatments to different groups of patients and comparing the results."
