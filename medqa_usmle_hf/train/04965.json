The family history for a bleeding disorder in the maternal uncle increases the suspicion of a clotting factor deficiency. Therefore, a prolonged partial thromboplastin time is the most likely finding. Elevated antinuclear antibody levels suggest an autoimmune disease, which is less likely given the acute onset of symptoms. Decreased platelet count would also suggest a bleeding disorder, but the lack of other bleeding symptoms and the presence of a bloody synovial fluid make this less likely. Synovial fluid leukocytosis would suggest an infection, which is not the most likely cause given the absence of fever and lack of involvement of other joints."
