The patient's symptoms, including severe right lower quadrant pain associated with vomiting and recent bleeding, suggest the possibility of ectopic pregnancy. Therefore, the best next step would be to check for urinary human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to determine if she is pregnant. This is important because if the patient is pregnant, an urgent obstetrical consultation is warranted. If the patient is not pregnant, further evaluation with imaging studies such as CT scan or ultrasound may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of appendicitis or other intra-abdominal pathology. Therefore, options B and C may also be important, but checking for hCG should be done first. Option D may be necessary if appendicitis is confirmed, but should not be the first step in management."

The patient presents with symptoms of acute appendicitis, but the recent bleeding suggests the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy.
