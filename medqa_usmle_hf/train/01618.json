The patient has a history of neonatal sepsis, recurrent respiratory infections, and otitis media, suggesting an underlying immunodeficiency. The immunological workup shows low levels of IgG, IgA, and CD3+ cells, indicating hypogammaglobulinemia and T-cell immunodeficiency. Periodical prophylactic antibiotic administration may be helpful in preventing infections, but it does not address the underlying immunodeficiency. Periodical intravenous immune globulin administration may be helpful in supplementing the patient\u2019s deficient antibodies, but it does not address the T-cell immunodeficiency. Chemotherapy is not indicated in this patient with pneumonia and immunodeficiency. Bone marrow transplantation may be considered as the option of choice for the further management of this patient as it can potentially correct both the B cell and T cell immunodeficiency."
