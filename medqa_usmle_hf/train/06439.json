The patient's symptoms and history of recent surgery and medication use suggest that the most likely diagnosis is exertional heat stroke. Malignant hyperthermia is a potential complication of anesthesia and is unlikely in this case. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a possible side effect of haloperidol, but the patient's presentation is not typical. Heat exhaustion symptoms are milder and do not include confusion and altered mental status."
