Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder and Adjustment Disorder do not fit the patient's symptoms as well.

The patient has also experienced a stressful life event (birth of a child), which can be a trigger for depression. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and adjustment disorder are less likely diagnoses given the patient's symptoms.

The patient's symptoms suggest major depressive disorder, including sadness, difficulty sleeping, loss of interest, fatigue, and poor appetite. The fact that the symptoms started after the birth of her daughter suggests postpartum depression, which is still considered major depressive disorder. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is usually diagnosed in children and adolescents, while adjustment disorder symptoms usually appear within 3 months after a stressor and resolve within 6 months after the stressor ends. The patient\u2019s symptoms have lasted for longer than 6 weeks. Finally, the question implies that the patient\u2019s symptoms are not a normal reaction to postpartum changes."
