The patient has hemolytic anemia, which is confirmed by the presence of spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear and the positive direct antiglobulin test. The undetectable haptoglobin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase further support this diagnosis. The most likely cause of this hemolysis is drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia, considering the recent use of cephalexin. Oral prednisone is the most appropriate next step in treatment to suppress the immune system and reduce hemolysis. Splenectomy may be considered in severe cases, and plasmapheresis and intravenous immune globulin can be used for acute exacerbations."

The patient exhibits symptoms of hemolytic anemia, as seen from the low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, high serum lactate dehydrogenase, and undetectable haptoglobin. The positive direct antiglobulin test and presence of spherocytes suggest immune hemolytic anemia. The most appropriate next step in treatment would be oral prednisone, a corticosteroid that is effective in reducing hemolysis and preventing further destruction of red blood cells. Splenectomy is a treatment option for chronic cases but is not appropriate as a first-line treatment. Plasmapheresis and intravenous immune globulin may be used in severe cases but are not the first-line treatment for immune hemolytic anemia."
