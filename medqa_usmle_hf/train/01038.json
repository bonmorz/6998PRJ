The patient is experiencing carbon monoxide poisoning due to the fire, and the COHb level is elevated but not severely so. Treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning involves oxygen therapy, so the patient should be given oxygen via a non-rebreather mask. Additionally, the appropriate next step in management is administration of intravenous hydroxycobalamin, which is a specific antidote for carbon monoxide poisoning. Intravenous dimercaprol and administration of methylene blue are not indicated for treating carbon monoxide poisoning. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be considered for severe carbon monoxide poisoning with a COHb level greater than 25%, but it is not necessary for this patient."

The patient's symptoms and ABG results suggest carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, which requires treatment with oxygen supplementation and administration of an antidote. Among the options, hydroxycobalamin is the preferred antidote for CO poisoning as it has a high affinity for CO and forms a non-toxic complex that can be eliminated from the body. Dimercaprol is used for heavy metal poisoning, methylene blue is used for methemoglobinemia, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be used in severe cases or if there are neurological symptoms, but it is not the first-line treatment in this case."
