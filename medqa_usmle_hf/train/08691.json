COX inhibitors can increase sensitivity to sunlight and cause skin reactions. A calcineurin inhibitor is used to treat autoimmune diseases, DNA gyrase inhibitors are used to treat bacterial infections, and NF-kB inhibitors are used to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

The patient presents with symptoms consistent with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and the positive stool guaiac test and flexible sigmoidoscopy findings support the diagnosis. The medication the patient received was likely a COX inhibitor, as these drugs are commonly used to treat IBD. The subsequent severe sunburn and skin itchiness suggest that the medication was a photosensitizer that causes increased sensitivity to sunlight, which is a common adverse effect of some COX inhibitors. Calculineurin inhibitors are used to suppress the immune system in conditions such as psoriasis, but do not typically cause photosensitivity. DNA gyrase inhibitors are antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections, while NF-kB inhibitors are used in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases but do not typically have photosensitivity as an adverse effect."
