GnRH stimulation testing is used to detect central precocious puberty where there is an early onset of puberty caused by the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG axis). A low LH response suggests peripheral precocious puberty, where puberty is caused by sex hormone secretion from the ovaries or adrenal glands. The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is to use a leuprolide test to see the estradiol levels, as this can help differentiate between central and peripheral precocious puberty. If the estradiol levels are elevated, it suggests central precocious puberty, while normal levels suggest peripheral precocious puberty."
