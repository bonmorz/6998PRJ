The symptoms and physical examination suggest adrenal insufficiency, specifically primary adrenal insufficiency or Addison's disease. The morning serum cortisol test result confirms this. The best next step in this case is to perform an ACTH stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis and determine the degree of adrenal insufficiency. Testing for plasma aldosterone, adrenal imaging, or 21-hydroxylase antibodies is not necessary in this case as they are not relevant to the diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency."
