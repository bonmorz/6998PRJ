Given the patient\u2019s history of CKD, decreased erythropoietin production is the most likely explanation for his decreased hemoglobin.

Other options such as metabolic acidosis, medication side effects, and uremic product retention may contribute to anemia in some cases but are not the primary mechanism in this patient\u2019s case."
