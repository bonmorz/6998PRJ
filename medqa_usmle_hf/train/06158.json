Constitutional growth delay is not likely, as the patient is tall for his age. Hypertension is possible but is not a likely explanation for the patient\u2019s overall presentation.

Presence of obesity, hypertension, and possible developmental delay (by being in the chess club and playing video games) are associated with precocious puberty. Constitutional growth delay is usually associated with delayed puberty. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis is more common in boys around 11-14 years old and is associated with being overweight, but there is no indication of it in the patient's exam."

However, the patient's age and height would not support hypertension as the most likely outcome. Constitutional growth delay would not account for the patient's high BMI. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis is a condition that occurs in adolescents, typically during a growth spurt, and is characterized by displacement of the femoral head. The patient's age and physical exam do not support this diagnosis. Lastly, precocious puberty is a known complication of obesity, especially in boys, and can cause earlier puberty than expected. Therefore, this is the most likely outcome in this patient."
