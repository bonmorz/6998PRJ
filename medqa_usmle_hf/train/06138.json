Short-acting beta2-agonists like albuterol activate beta2 receptors, which are Gs protein-coupled receptors that activate adenylyl cyclase and increase intracellular cAMP. This results in smooth muscle relaxation, bronchodilation, and decreased bronchospasm, which can relieve asthma symptoms. Option B and C are incorrect because they describe a different mechanism of action for a different class of medication, such as muscarinic agonists or leukotriene antagonists. Option D is incorrect because Gq protein-coupled receptors activate phospholipase C, not adenylyl cyclase."
