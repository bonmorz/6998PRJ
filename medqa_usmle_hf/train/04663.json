The score is given based on five factors: heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and color. Each factor is given a score of 0, 1, or 2, and the scores are added up to give an overall score out of 10. In this case, the heart rate is 1 (less than 100), respiratory effort is 2 (spontaneous and regular), muscle tone is 1 (some flexion), reflex irritability is 2 (responds to stimulation), and color is 2 (pink with blue extremities). Therefore, the Apgar score is 8 (2+2+1+2+1)."
