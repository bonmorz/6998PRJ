The CT scan shows a left-sided epidural hematoma, which is a collection of blood in the space between the skull and the dura mater. The most appropriate medical treatment for this patient is mannitol, which is an osmotic diuretic used to reduce intracranial pressure. It can be given to decrease cerebral edema and increase intravascular volume. The other options are incorrect because PaCO2 of 24 mm Hg is too low and can cause respiratory alkalosis, placement of a VP shunt is not indicated for epidural hematoma, and acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used to treat altitude sickness and glaucoma, but is not indicated for epidural hematoma."

Placement of a VP shunt is not appropriate at this time, and acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that can help decrease ICP in certain cases but is not the first-line treatment in this situation."
