The superior gluteal nerve is responsible for innervating the hip abductor muscles, making option (A) the correct choice. The femoral nerve is responsible for motor innervation of the quadriceps muscle, and would not cause this specific gait abnormality. The inferior gluteal nerve is responsible for innervating the gluteus maximus muscle, which does not contribute significantly to hip abduction. The obturator nerve is responsible for motor innervation of the adductor muscles of the thigh and would not cause this specific gait abnormality."
