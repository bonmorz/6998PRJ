Angiotensin-II causes vasoconstriction of the efferent arterioles in the kidneys, resulting in decreased renal plasma flow, but increased filtration fraction (GFR/RPF). This is because the increased resistance in the efferent arterioles causes an increased glomerular capillary pressure, leading to an increase in filtration fraction. Therefore, the correct answer is (D)."

However, it also increases the glomerular filtration rate by constricting the efferent arteriole more than the afferent arteriole, leading to increased filtration fraction. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Decreased renal plasma flow and increased filtration fraction."
