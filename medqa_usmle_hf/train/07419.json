The patient has had multiple depressive phases over the past 3 years, with a longer symptom-free gap between them, which is consistent with the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder (previously called dysthymia). The recent loss of his mother may have triggered the current exacerbation, but the presence of multiple past episodes and the chronicity of his symptoms favor the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder over an adjustment disorder. Major depressive disorder typically presents with more severe symptoms and may not have the chronicity of this patient\u2019s symptoms. Persistent complex bereavement disorder is a relatively new diagnosis characterized by prolonged grief and mourning after the loss of a loved one, but the timing and chronicity of the patient's symptoms do not fit this diagnosis."

Major depressive disorder would be a possibility if the symptoms were more severe or if there was a clear onset or offset to the episode. Persistent complex bereavement disorder would be a possibility if his grief reaction to his mother's death were more intense or prolonged."

Adjustment disorder with depressed mood is characterized by time-limited depressive symptoms following a stressful event that do not last as long as in this patient. Major depressive disorder typically includes more severe symptoms that cause significant impairment in daily activities, and the patient's symptoms do not meet this threshold."

Adjustment disorder with depressed mood would not be appropriate as the symptoms have lasted for more than 6 months.

Persistent complex bereavement disorder is unlikely as the patient's symptoms began prior to his mother's death."
