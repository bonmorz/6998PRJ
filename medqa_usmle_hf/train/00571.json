Physical abuse cannot be ruled out entirely, but it is less likely given the patient's history and presentation."

The patient\u2019s presentation suggests vitamin K deficiency, which can cause bleeding gums, easy bruisability, and heavy menses. The prolonged PT supports this diagnosis, as vitamin K is needed for clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. None of the other options are supported by the patient\u2019s history or laboratory tests. Acute myelogenous leukemia would likely present with abnormal WBC count and bleeding time. Missed miscarriage would present with positive urine pregnancy test and evidence of fetal tissue on ultrasound. Physical abuse may cause bruising and bleeding, but it would not explain the prolonged PT or microcytic anemia."

Anorexia nervosa can cause malnutrition with vitamin deficiencies, and her recent antibiotic use may have disrupted her gut microbiota, leading to decreased vitamin K absorption. Acute myelogenous leukemia may cause bleeding, but it usually presents with leukocytosis and bone pain. Missed miscarriage and physical abuse are unlikely in this case as the patient is not sexually active and there is no history of trauma."
