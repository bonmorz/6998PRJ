The absence of palpable gonads and a karyotype of 46,XX suggests that the newborn has congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to exposure to excessive androgenic steroids during gestation. CAH can result in ambiguous genitalia, and it is more common in females than males. Defective androgen receptors and 5-alpha-reductase deficiency are causes of male pseudohermaphroditism. Defective migration of GnRH releasing neurons results in Kallmann syndrome, which is associated with anosmia and hypogonadism."
