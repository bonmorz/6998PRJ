Grapefruit juice inhibits the enzyme that breaks down warfarin, leading to an increase in its blood levels and an increased risk of bleeding. The patient's recent change in diet to include more grapefruit juice could have contributed to the intracranial bleed. St. John's wort can affect the metabolism of many medications, but not warfarin. Chili peppers and spinach do not have any known interactions with warfarin."
