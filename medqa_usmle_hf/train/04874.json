The side effects listed suggest that the medication in question is digoxin, which is commonly used for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Digoxin toxicity is associated with hypokalemia, which increases the risk of arrhythmias and enhances the toxicity of the medication. Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia may also affect digoxin pharmacokinetics, but they do not increase the risk of toxicity. Increased GFR with normal creatinine may result in decreased digoxin levels and potentially decreased efficacy, but it does not increase the risk of toxicity."

Hyponatremia may also increase susceptibility to arrhythmias, but it is not specifically associated with class IV antiarrhythmic medications.
