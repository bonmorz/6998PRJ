Option A is not the best management as diazepam is not the first choice for seizure prophylaxis in preeclampsia, but instead magnesium sulfate is preferred. Option B does not address the need for urgent delivery in severe preeclampsia. Option D is incorrect as nifedipine is not the recommended treatment for seizure prophylaxis in preeclampsia."
