The symptoms and blisters on the skin indicate a pemphigus vulgaris diagnosis, which is confirmed by the presence of ulcers on the mucosa. The use of captopril can sometimes cause pemphigus-like lesions. While dermatitis herpetiformis also causes blisters, it is not typically associated with mucosal involvement. Lichen planus may cause oral lesions, but the blisters on the skin are not characteristic. Bullous pemphigoid also causes blisters, but they are tense and do not easily separate with light stroking."
