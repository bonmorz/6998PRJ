The mother\u2019s blood group and fetal blood group being different suggest that there might have been some mixing of fetal and maternal blood during delivery which could have contributed to the physiological neonatal jaundice. This is further supported by the baby\u2019s age (only 5 days old) and the absence of any other symptoms or abnormal lab results. Dubin-Johnson syndrome and biliary atresia are both rare and their symptoms differ from what is described in the case. Congenital hypothyroidism can cause jaundice, but it would not present this early and the baby\u2019s T4 levels are not indicative of hypothyroidism."
