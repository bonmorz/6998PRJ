The most helpful next step to confirm the diagnosis of a hydrocele is the transillumination test followed by a scrotal ultrasound. Option A is incorrect because measurement of AFP and hCG levels is used to diagnose testicular tumors. Option C is incorrect because evaluation of the cremasteric reflex is used to diagnose torsion or inflammation of the testicle. Option D is incorrect because a standard urinalysis would not diagnose a hydrocele."

The description of the patient's symptoms suggests a diagnosis of a hydrocele, which is caused by serous fluid accumulation in the scrotum due to a patent processus vaginalis. The most useful next step in confirming the diagnosis is to perform a transillumination test followed by scrotal ultrasound. Transillumination will allow visualization of the fluid, and ultrasound can confirm the presence of excess fluid in the scrotum.
