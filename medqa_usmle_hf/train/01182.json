The patient\u2019s lack of sense of smell suggests that he has Kallmann syndrome, which is caused by a failure of normal neuronal migration during development. This in turn affects the development of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, leading to delayed puberty. Chromosomal duplication and expansile suprasellar tumor can also cause delayed puberty but are not associated with anosmia. Defects in steroid production are associated with other endocrine disorders, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, but are not specifically implicated in this patient\u2019s condition."

The absence of a sense of smell from birth suggests that the patient has Kallmann syndrome, which is caused by a failure of normal neuronal migration during development.

Chromosomal duplications and steroid production defects are not typically associated with Kallmann syndrome. An expansile suprasellar tumor may interfere with GnRH secretion, but this is not the most common cause of Kallmann syndrome."
