However, the increased nuchal translucency measurement of 3.3mm indicates an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities. To increase diagnostic accuracy, levels of free beta-hCG and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) should be determined. Serum alpha-fetoprotein, hCG, and unconjugated estriol levels are used in the second trimester screening for chromosomal abnormalities, not at 12 weeks gestation. At this gestational age, nuchal translucency has high diagnostic value."
