The combination of a rumbling diastolic murmur at the apex and an elevated \u03b2-hCG concentration suggests the patient is pregnant and has mitral stenosis caused by rheumatic heart disease. The worsening dyspnea is most likely due to increased intravascular volume, as pregnancy causes an increase in blood volume. Decreased right ventricular preload would not cause dyspnea, while decreased minute ventilation would not be a likely cause given the patient's relatively normal respiratory rate. Increased right ventricular afterload would be a possible explanation, but it is less likely than increased intravascular volume."
