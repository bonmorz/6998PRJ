Small cell carcinoma of the lung is often associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, in this case, optic neuritis and uveitis. These syndromes are often associated with the presence of specific antibodies, with Anti-CV2 (CRMP5) being the most commonly associated with ocular paraneoplastic syndromes. The other antibodies listed are associated with different types of paraneoplastic syndromes, but not specifically with ocular symptoms."
