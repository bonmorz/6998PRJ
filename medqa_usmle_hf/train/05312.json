The sudden onset of vision loss and weakness/paralysis in one wrist suggest a neurological symptom, but the MRI is unremarkable. The patient appears indifferent to her current situation and presents with a flat affect, which suggest Conversion disorder is the most likely diagnosis. Factitious disorder includes self-inflicted harm, but there is no evidence of harm in this case. Transient ischemic attack may cause sudden neurological symptoms, but the MRI is unremarkable. Major depressive disorder may cause slurring of words and a depressed affect, but there are no other neurological symptoms mentioned in the case."

The patient's past medical history is insignificant for any other possible etiology. The presence of normal reflexes and muscular strength rules out TIA, and absence of slurring of words rules out a stroke. Factitious disorder involves consciously feigning symptoms for personal gain, which is not suggested here. Major depressive disorder would not present with sudden onset motor and sensory deficits."

The sudden onset of vision loss and weakness of left wrist without slurring of words suggests a psychogenic/psychiatric cause. Among the options, Conversion Disorder is the most likely diagnosis because it involves neurological symptoms that cannot be fully explained by medical findings. Factitious disorder involves intentional production of symptoms and Major Depressive Disorder would not usually present with sudden neurological symptoms. Transient Ischemic Attack can cause sudden neurological symptoms, but the MRI of the brain being unremarkable makes it less likely."
