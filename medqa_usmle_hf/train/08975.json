Uterine artery embolization (B) is a treatment option for uterine fibroids and abnormal uterine bleeding but is not appropriate for this patient's condition. Intravenous methotrexate administration (C) is used for medical management of ectopic pregnancy, but the negative pregnancy test and ultrasound findings make ectopic pregnancy unlikely."
