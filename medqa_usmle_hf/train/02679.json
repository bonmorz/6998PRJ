The patient's symptoms suggest Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which is characterized by skin slough with scattered vesicles and erosions throughout the face and extremities. It is often due to an adverse reaction to medications, such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in this case. Erythema multiforme generally involves mucosal lesions, which the patient does not have. Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) can also present with skin rash, but it is often accompanied by eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and organ involvement, which the patient does not have. Toxic shock syndrome is often associated with fever, hypotension, and organ dysfunction, and the patient's vital signs do not suggest this."
