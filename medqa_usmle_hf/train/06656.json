Antisocial personality disorder is a possible diagnosis, but the patient is only 14 years old and the symptoms have been present since childhood, which is more suggestive of conduct disorder. The patient\u2019s past history of ADHD also supports the diagnosis of conduct disorder, as there is a high comorbidity between the two disorders. Schizoid personality disorder is not supported by the patient\u2019s presentation."

These are all signs of Conduct disorder, which often develops during childhood and adolescence, and is characterized by a persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated. Antisocial personality disorder usually develops after 18 years of age, and involves more severe and persistent violations of these norms, often accompanied by a lack of empathy and remorse. ADHD and Schizoid personality disorder do not fit the patient's symptoms."
