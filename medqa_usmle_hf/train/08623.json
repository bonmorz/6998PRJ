The image shows neutrophils, which are the primary phagocytes in the body and important in fighting bacterial infections. This is consistent with the diagnosis of an inflamed appendix. Antigen presentation is a function of dendritic cells, and transplant rejection is primarily mediated by T cells. Allergic reactions involve a variety of cells including mast cells and eosinophils, but not primarily neutrophils."

Neutrophils are the first to respond to infection or injury and can phagocytose bacteria, debris, and other foreign particles. The increase in neutrophils seen in the blood cell count indicates an inflammatory response, which is typical of an inflamed appendix. Answer choice (A) is incorrect because antigen presentation is a function of macrophages and dendritic cells. Answer choice (B) is incorrect because transplant rejection involves T cells and antibody-mediated responses. Answer choice (C) is incorrect because allergic reactions involve mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils."

In the context of the patient's presentation, the increased number of neutrophils in the blood cell count is likely due to an inflammatory response to the inflamed appendix. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Phagocytosis. Allergic reactions involve other types of immune cells, like mast cells and eosinophils, while antigen presentation and transplant rejection involve specialized immune cells like dendritic cells and T cells."
