The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which is characterized by severe mood and physical symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Combination oral contraceptives can help regulate menstrual cycles and reduce PMDD symptoms. NSAIDs can also help manage physical symptoms. It is important to address birth control in a patient with PMDD because mood symptoms may be exacerbated by hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle. Anxiolytic therapy and nonserotonergic antidepressants may not specifically target PMDD symptoms while SSRIs may be effective but are not the first line of treatment for PMDD."
