The patient's history of IV drug use, nasal packing, and purpuric rash on arms and legs suggest a possible case of necrotizing fasciitis or invasive fungal sinusitis. The immediate problem is the nasal packing potentially blocking the airway, which should be removed. Administration of empirical antibiotics such as Vancomycin or Nafcillin can follow but would not be the immediate first step. Use of norepinephrine would not be appropriate as the patient is hypotensive, not hypertensive."
