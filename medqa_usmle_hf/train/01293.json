Intussusception is a medical emergency that requires prompt intervention to avoid ischemia and necrosis of the affected bowel. A barium enema may be sufficient to reduce the intussusception in some cases, but the patient should be admitted to the hospital for observation and monitoring for complications and/or recurrence. Repeat barium enemas may be required in some cases, but this option is not suitable for initial management. NPO and work-up for a lead-point should be conducted if lead-point intussusception is suspected, but in this case, the diagnosis has been confirmed via ultrasound and barium enema. Urgent surgical reduction with resection of necrotic segments of bowel may be necessary if the patient does not respond to non-surgical treatment, but this is not the next best step in this case."

Option A is not necessary as the diagnosis has been confirmed and the intussusception has been reduced.

Option D may be necessary if the intussusception cannot be reduced or if there is necrotic bowel present, but it is not the next best step at this point."
