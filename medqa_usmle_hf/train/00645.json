Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor are useful in treating bleeding disorders like hemophilia, but not appropriate in this scenario. Protamine sulfate and hydroxyethyl starch are used to reverse heparin and saline-induced hypotension, respectively, and are not appropriate treatments for this patient."
