The symptoms, including tenderness to palpation over the upper lateral part of the right thigh and pain aggravated while climbing stairs or lying on the right side, suggest Greater trochanteric pain syndrome. The positive test of abducting the extended right leg against the physician's resistance also supports this diagnosis. Iliotibial band syndrome may cause lateral hip pain but does not cause tenderness to palpation. Lumbosacral radiculopathy may cause pain radiating to the leg but does not present with tenderness to palpation over the upper lateral part of the thigh. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head presents with a gradual onset of hip pain and is more common in patients with a history of steroid use, alcoholism, or sickle cell disease, but is less likely in this patient as the X-ray of the pelvis is normal."

The tenderness to palpation over the upper lateral part of the right thigh and reproducing the pain by abducting the extended right leg against the physician's resistance further supports this diagnosis. The lack of swelling and normal x-ray results make options C and D less likely. Iliotibial band syndrome typically presents with pain on the lateral aspect of the knee and is not usually aggravated by lying on the affected side."

The patient\u2019s symptoms fit the criteria for greater trochanteric pain syndrome, which is characterized by peri-trochanteric pain aggravated by hip adduction and internal rotation. Iliotibial band syndrome may also cause lateral hip pain, but it primarily affects runners and may cause swelling and inflammation along the iliotibial band. Lumbosacral radiculopathy may cause lower back pain and leg pain, but it does not usually present with hip pain. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head may cause hip pain, but it usually presents in older adults, and x-ray findings are often abnormal."
