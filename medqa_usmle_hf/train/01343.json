The symptoms and physical exam findings suggest hyperthyroidism, and decreased serum TSH is a common finding in this condition. Decreased free T4 is more commonly found in hypothyroidism. Increased anti-mitochondrial antibodies are associated with autoimmune disorders such as primary biliary cholangitis, which is not likely to be the cause of this patient\u2019s symptoms. Increased serum TSH would be found in hypothyroidism as the pituitary gland would be trying to stimulate the thyroid to produce more hormones."

This is because the pituitary gland releases TSH to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. In hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland is already overproducing hormones, so the pituitary gland reduces TSH production. Decreased free T4 or increased anti-mitochondrial antibodies are not specific to hyperthyroidism, and increased serum TSH is more likely in hypothyroidism."

In Graves' disease, there is an autoantibody called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) that mimics thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), leading to increased production of thyroid hormone. Therefore, the most likely lab result would be decreased serum TSH. Decreased free T4 is also possible since there is excess production of thyroid hormone. Increased anti-mitochondrial antibodies is characteristic of primary biliary cholangitis and not relevant to this case. Increased serum TSH would be seen in hypothyroidism."
