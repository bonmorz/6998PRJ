These symptoms suggest infection with Vibrio cholerae, which is a Gram-negative, oxidase-positive, comma-shaped bacteria. The weakness and reduced sensations are consistent with a neuropathy caused by the toxin produced by V. cholerae. The strength testing results suggest a lower extremity weakness, but upper extremity strength is not affected, which is often seen in neuropathies caused by toxins."
