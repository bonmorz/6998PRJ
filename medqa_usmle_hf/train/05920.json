The symptoms suggest that the patient is experiencing delayed emergence from anesthesia which can be caused by high lipid solubility of the anesthetic agent. This can occur in patients with high BMI due to their increased body fat content. Low cytochrome P450 activity and low blood solubility do not affect emergence from anesthesia while high minimal alveolar concentration is related to the potency of anesthetic agents, not emergence from anesthesia."
