The symptoms suggest a possible allergic reaction to lamotrigine, which can cause a rash and facial edema, among other symptoms. The presentation with hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy suggests a possible systemic allergic reaction, which can cause an increased absolute eosinophil count. Fragmented red blood cells are not typically seen in an allergic reaction. A positive heterophile antibody test suggests infectious mononucleosis, which is not associated with the use of lamotrigine. An elevated antistreptolysin-O titer suggests a current or recent streptococcal infection, which is also not associated with the use of lamotrigine."
