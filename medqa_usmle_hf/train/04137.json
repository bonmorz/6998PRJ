The patient\u2019s symptoms, including dyspnea, swelling, frequent awakenings, and excessive daytime sleepiness, suggest obstructive sleep apnea. The oropharyngeal examination shows typical anatomical features associated with obstructive sleep apnea, and the echocardiogram shows a mildly dilated right ventricle and elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure, which can be caused by untreated sleep apnea. The absence of abnormalities in the lungs and the ventilation-perfusion scan make options A, B, and D less likely."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, such as snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, and frequent awakenings, suggest obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The examination of the oropharynx and the echocardiography also support this diagnosis. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) are possibilities for dyspnea, but the absence of cough and clear lungs make PTE unlikely, while the absence of wheezing, sputum production or history of exposure to environmental pollution, point towards a COPD diagnosis. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) can cause dyspnea, but it is unlikely as echocardiography shows no abnormalities of the left heart."

The patient\u2019s symptoms of dyspnea, swelling of the lower extremities, frequent awakenings at night, and excessive daytime sleepiness are suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea. The oropharyngeal examination shows a small orifice, enlarged tongue, and low-lying soft palate, all contributing to the development of obstructive sleep apnea. Echocardiography shows mild right ventricular dilation and elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure, associated with long-standing obstructive sleep apnea. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease would present with a chronic cough and sputum production, and would be seen on lung auscultation. Idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension would not be associated with obstructive sleep apnea. Pulmonary thromboembolism would present with sudden onset dyspnea with pleuritic chest pain, and would be seen on ventilation-perfusion scan."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest obstructive sleep apnea, with frequent awakenings at night and excessive daytime sleepiness. The oropharyngeal examination also shows features commonly seen in patients with obstructive sleep apnea such as a small orifice and an enlarged tongue and uvula. The mildly dilated right ventricle and elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure seen on echocardiography may be secondary to the pulmonary hypertension associated with obstructive sleep apnea. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary thromboembolism can also cause dyspnea and swelling of the lower extremities, but the absence of cough and clear lungs on auscultation, and the normal ventilation-perfusion scan make these less likely causes. Idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension is another possible diagnosis, but it is less likely given the history of smoking and the presence of features suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea."
