The history of intestinal malrotation and volvulus suggests that the cystic mass is related to embryological development.

If the vitelline duct does not disappear as it is supposed to, it can enlarge to form a cystic mass called a Meckel\u2019s diverticulum. The presence of columnar epithelium with goblet cells supports this diagnosis."
