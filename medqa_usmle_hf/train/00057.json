Burkitt lymphoma primarily occurs in children and young adults and is associated with involvement of the jaw and abdominal organs. Adult T-cell lymphoma is associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 infection and affects primarily Japan and the Caribbean. Hodgkin lymphoma is associated with Reed-Sternberg cells and typically present with localized lymphadenopathy."

The symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of lymphoma, which is confirmed by the excised cervical lymph node showing lymphocytes with a high proliferative index that stain positive for CD20. Among the options, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and has a similar presentation to the patient's. Burkitt lymphoma is more common in children and young adults and is characterized by rapidly growing tumors in the abdomen or pelvis. Hodgkin lymphoma typically presents with painless lymphadenopathy and B symptoms and is differentiated from DLBCL based on specific histopathological findings. Adult T-cell lymphoma is associated with human T-lymphotropic virus-1 infection and is more common in Asia and Africa."
