The symptoms and laboratory findings suggest glomerulonephritis, specifically rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN).

Discontinuation of NSAID may help with the acute kidney injury, but the etiology of RPGN must be identified. Fomepizole is used in the management of ethylene glycol toxicity. Intravenous fluid therapy and electrolyte correction may help with the acute kidney injury, but the etiology of RPGN must be identified."
