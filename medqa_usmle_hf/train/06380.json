The patient\u2019s symptoms, including joint pain, episodic painful discoloration in fingers, and palpable purpura suggest an immune complex formation, which can occur in a variety of diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and vasculitis. Smoking can exacerbate the immune response, but it is not the primary cause of the condition. The abnormal liver function tests and elevated creatinine suggest renal involvement, which can also occur in autoimmune diseases."
