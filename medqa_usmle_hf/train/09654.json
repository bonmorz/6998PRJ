The drop arm test, which involves elevating the arm and then lowering it slowly, is a useful test for diagnosing rotator cuff tear. Injection of lidocaine into the subacromial space did not relieve the pain, indicating that the pain is not due to subacromial bursitis."

The patient has pain in the top of her shoulder that is worse with movement, stiffness in the morning, and difficulty with activities like brushing her hair and playing tennis, which are all indicative of rotator cuff tear. The pain between 60 and 120 degrees of abduction and inability to hold her arm up suggest rotator cuff dysfunction. The lidocaine injection not relieving pain or improving active range of motion confirms the diagnosis. Cervical radiculopathy can cause similar symptoms but the lidocaine injection would have relieved pain if that was the diagnosis."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a rotator cuff tear, such as pain at the top of the shoulder and difficulty with overhead activities. The pain between 60 and 120 degrees of abduction and inability to hold her arm up during passive range of motion support this diagnosis. Injection of lidocaine into the subacromial space did not relieve the pain or improve range of motion, also supporting a rotator cuff tear over subacromial bursitis. Cervical radiculopathy and biceps tendinitis are less likely based on the patient's history and physical examination findings."

The patient's symptoms suggest a rotator cuff tear, as there is pain with movement and inability to hold her arm up when lowered slowly. Injection of 1% lidocaine into the subacromial space did not relieve the pain or improve active range of motion, which supports the diagnosis of rotator cuff tear. Cervical radiculopathy would cause pain and numbness that radiates down the arm, which is not described in this case. Subacromial bursitis and biceps tendinitis would not account for the inability to hold the arm up when lowered slowly."
