Brown recluse bites can also cause muscle cramping and abdominal pain, but they typically present with a deep blue or purple color change at the site of the bite. Cryptopid centipede bites can cause local pain, but not systemic symptoms like hypertension and tachycardia. Tick bites do not typically present with muscle cramping and abdominal pain."

Option A, the brown recluse spider, can cause skin necrosis but does not typically cause severe muscle cramping and abdominal pain. Option C, cryptopid centipede, can cause similar symptoms but is not typically found in Virginia. Option D, ticks, can transmit numerous diseases but are not typically associated with the symptoms described."

Brown recluse spider bites can cause skin necrosis, but they do not usually cause hypertensive and tachycardic responses.
