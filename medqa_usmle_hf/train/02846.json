Incidence refers to the number of new cases of a disease in a population over a certain period of time, while prevalence refers to the total number of cases of a disease in a population at a given time. The figure does not provide information about the total population at risk, so we cannot calculate incidence or prevalence. However, we can see that 2 of the 6 patients had flares during the month of May, so the correct answer is (B): incidence during the month of May was 2."

The incidence during April 1st to June 1st was 4, and the year-long prevalence was 5/6 (not including patient 5 who was in remission for the duration of the study). Prevalence of the disease on May 15 is not given in the figure, so (D) is incorrect."
