The patient presents with acute-onset severe abdominal pain and a rigid abdomen, which may suggest a surgical emergency such as perforation or obstruction. Initial evaluation should include auscultation of the abdomen to assess for bowel sounds, which may be absent in cases of obstruction. Eliciting shifting dullness or performing light palpation may be contraindicated in cases of suspected surgical emergencies. Percussing the point of maximal pain may be useful in cases of suspected appendicitis, but it is not the most appropriate initial evaluation in this case."

The patient has acute-onset severe abdominal pain, a history of frequent episodes of vague abdominal pain, and a flat and rigid abdomen.

The next best step is to auscultate the abdomen, listening for bowel sounds and other abnormal sounds such as peritoneal rubbing or crepitus, which could suggest intra-abdominal pathology. Other options, such as eliciting shifting dullness or performing palpation, may be too invasive or painful for the patient in this acute setting."
