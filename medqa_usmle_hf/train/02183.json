Defective fibrillin is associated with Marfan syndrome, which is not related to infertility. Decreased LH levels might indicate male hypogonadism, but this is not the most likely cause given the physical examination findings. Elevated homocysteine levels are associated with cardiovascular disease but not infertility."
