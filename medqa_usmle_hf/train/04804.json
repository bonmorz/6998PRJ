The symptoms of difficulty swallowing and hoarseness suggest compression of the esophagus and recurrent laryngeal nerve, respectively. The enlarged cardiac chamber pressing into the esophagus is most likely caused by an enlarged left atrium, which can be a consequence of long-standing uncontrolled hypertension or other cardiovascular diseases. The opening snap heard over the cardiac apex suggests mitral stenosis, which is a common cause of left atrial enlargement. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Left atrium."
