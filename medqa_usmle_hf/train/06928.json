The most appropriate initial response by the physician is to explore the patient's thoughts and feelings about his friend no longer returning his calls, rather than immediately addressing his drinking. Option (C) shows empathy and allows the patient to express his own concerns about the situation, which can lead to further discussion and eventual addressing of his drinking habits."

It also avoids being confrontational or accusatory about the patient\u2019s drinking habits, which could provoke defensiveness and hamper the physician-patient relationship. Option A may sound judgmental and Option B may provoke denial, both of which can discourage the patient from opening up to the physician. Option D is more confrontational and may make the patient defensive."
