The chronic cough with foul-smelling sputum and the history of multiple respiratory infections suggests a diagnosis of bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis can be caused by decreased motility of cilia, leading to impaired clearance of secretions and chronic respiratory tract infections. The ECG finding of pronounced right axis deviation may be related to right ventricular hypertrophy resulting from chronic pulmonary disease. Options B, C, and D are not associated with bronchiectasis."

The chronic cough with foul-smelling sputum, along with the history of multiple episodes of otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis, suggests a diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). This is a disorder characterized by abnormal ciliary motion due to structural defects or dysfunction of the cilia. Clubbing, pronounced right axis deviation on ECG, and wheezing and crackles on pulmonary exam are all associated with PCD. Defective maturation of B-lymphocytes is associated with immunodeficiency disorders. Maldevelopment of pharyngeal pouches is associated with congenital anomalies such as branchial cysts and thyroglossal duct cysts. Transient bronchoconstriction is associated with asthma."
