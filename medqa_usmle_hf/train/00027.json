Acting out is a defense mechanism in which the individual deals with emotional conflict or stress by engaging in impulsive or unacceptable behavior. In this case, the patient's behavior of skipping classes, bullying, and smoking cigarettes can be seen as a manifestation of his emotional turmoil after his father's departure and his mother's infidelity. Projection involves attributing one's own unacceptable thoughts or feelings onto others, passive aggression involves indirect resistance to authority or demands, and regression involves reverting to an earlier stage of emotional development."

Acting out is defined as expressing negative feelings and impulses through actions rather than through communication or self-reflection.

Projection involves attributing one's own unacceptable feelings and thoughts to others. Passive aggression involves expressing anger indirectly, such as through intentional inefficiency or stubbornness. Regression involves reverting to behaviors associated with an earlier stage of development. None of these defense mechanisms fit the patient's behavior as described in the scenario."
