The patient's history of previously good health, along with the appearance and characteristics of the nodules, strongly suggest that the underlying mechanism is extravasation of lipoproteins. This is consistent with the diagnosis of xanthomas, which are nodules composed of cholesterol and other lipids that accumulate in the skin due to various metabolic disorders. Fibrinoid necrosis and crystallization of monosodium urate are not associated with xanthomas, while uncontrolled adipocyte growth could potentially cause subcutaneous nodules but is not consistent with the appearance and characteristics of the nodules in this case."
