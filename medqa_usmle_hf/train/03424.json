The physical exam findings suggest Klinefelter syndrome, a genetic disorder where a male is born with an extra X chromosome. In this syndrome, testosterone levels are decreased and there is an increase in aromatase activity, which converts androgens to estrogens. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Aromatase."

The patient's symptoms suggest Klinefelter syndrome, which is characterized by tall stature, gynecomastia, and small testes. In this condition, estrogen levels are increased due to the presence of an extra X chromosome, leading to the development of gynecomastia. Aromatase is an enzyme that converts testosterone to estrogen, so it is likely to be increased in this patient. Testosterone levels would be decreased, and inhibin levels would be normal or decreased. Sertoli cells are responsible for spermatogenesis, so they would likely be decreased in this patient due to the small testes."
