The patient has a history of left ventricular dysfunction, which puts him at higher risk of sudden cardiac death. Therefore, the best next step for this patient is to receive an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to prevent future episodes of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Intravenous magnesium sulphate can be used for torsades de pointes, which is a form of ventricular tachycardia associated with a prolonged QT interval. Intravenous adenosine and temporary or permanent cardiac pacing are not indicated in the management of ventricular tachycardia."
