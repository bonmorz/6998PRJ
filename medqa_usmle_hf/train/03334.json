The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with age-related memory decline, as she is living independently and performing daily activities. Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Lewy-body dementia typically have more severe and progressive memory impairment. Vascular dementia is more likely to manifest with focal neurological deficits such as weakness or sensory loss. Therefore, aging is the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s symptoms."
