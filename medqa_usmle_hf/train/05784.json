X-ray of the spine may not be sensitive enough to detect bone metastasis, and bone scintigraphy may be too expensive and require a high radiation dose. MRI of the spine is the most appropriate next step in management as it can detect bone metastasis with high sensitivity and specificity. Positron emission tomography can detect bone metastasis, but it is less specific than MRI."
