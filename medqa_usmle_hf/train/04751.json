The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a urea cycle disorder, which includes deficiencies in enzymes involved in urea synthesis. Among the options, only Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency matches the symptoms and laboratory findings presented in the case. OTC is involved in the catalysis of carbomyl phosphate and ornithine to form citrulline, a step in the urea cycle. Deficiency in this enzyme causes hyperammonemia which can lead to metabolic encephalopathy and coma."
