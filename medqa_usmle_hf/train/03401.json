Symptoms have been ongoing for the past 6 weeks, which is consistent with the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. The patient may also have depression, but the PTSD symptoms are more prominent. Alcohol withdrawal may cause jumpy behavior, but the patient's symptoms have been ongoing for 6 weeks, which is inconsistent with alcohol withdrawal. Midlife crisis is not a recognized diagnostic category in medicine."
