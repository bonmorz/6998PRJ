Aspiration of meconium can lead to meconium aspiration syndrome, which can also cause respiratory distress but presents differently on imaging."

The symptoms, such as rapid breathing, grunting, and subcostal retractions, suggest respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The x-ray findings of diffuse reticulonodular ground-glass opacities with air bronchograms are also consistent with RDS. Among the options, RDS is caused by low concentration of lamellar bodies, which reduces the production of surfactant and results in difficulties breathing. Abnormal budding of the foregut does not cause RDS, it can cause esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistulas. Defects in alpha-1 antitrypsin can cause emphysema. Aspiration of meconium can cause meconium aspiration syndrome, but the x-ray findings are different from those seen in RDS."
