Total T3 level reflects both thyroid gland secretion and peripheral conversion, which is less reliable in monitoring the replacement therapy.

Monitoring treatment with free T4 levels can help ensure that the patient's thyroid hormone levels are optimized. Total T3 measures the total amount of T3 circulating in the bloodstream (both protein-bound and free T3) and is not as useful for monitoring treatment as free T4. MCV is a measure of the size of red blood cells and is not directly related to thyroid function. TSH levels can be helpful in diagnosing hypothyroidism initially but may not accurately reflect thyroid hormone levels during treatment. Therefore, free T4 is a better marker for treatment monitoring."
