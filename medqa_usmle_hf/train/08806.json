The patient was diagnosed with alcoholic liver cirrhosis with mild to moderate ascites, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances. The low K+ level (hypokalemia) can be a side effect of treatment with loop diuretics like furosemide, which are often used to manage ascites in liver cirrhosis. Hypokalemia can cause cardiac arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia, which the patient experienced. Hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril are not loop diuretics and do not cause hypokalemia. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic and is not used to manage ascites or electrolyte imbalances."
