Option (A) and (D) are incorrect as they both involve inhibition of synthesis of substances, whereas omalizumab does not affect synthesis but instead blocks the action of IgE antibodies. Option (C) is incorrect as it refers to interleukin-3, which is not targeted by omalizumab."

Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to IgE antibodies in the blood and prevents them from binding to mast cell receptors. This reduces the allergic response and helps improve asthma symptoms. Option A is incorrect as IL-4 is involved in the activation of Th2 cells, which play a role in allergic diseases but is not directly targeted by omalizumab. Option C is incorrect as IL-3 is involved in the production of blood cells and not related to allergy or asthma. Option D is incorrect as omalizumab targets IgE antibodies and does not affect their synthesis."
