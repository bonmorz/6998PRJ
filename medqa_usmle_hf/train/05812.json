Contraction of skeletal muscles, relaxation of the bladder neck sphincter, and release of epinephrine by the adrenal medulla are not related to the mechanism of action of the drug described, so they are not likely to be additional effects."

The drug that results in contraction of the pupillary dilator muscle when instilled topically is most likely to be a sympathomimetic drug, which acts by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system. Intravenous administration of such a drug is likely to cause an increase in pyloric sphincter tone, as the same receptor type is found in both the pupillary dilator and pyloric sphincter muscles. Contraction of skeletal muscles is caused by activation of the somatic nervous system, not the sympathetic nervous system. Relaxation of the bladder neck sphincter is caused by activation of the parasympathetic nervous system, which has opposite effects to the sympathetic nervous system. Release of epinephrine by the adrenal medulla is also caused by activation of the sympathetic nervous system, but it is not a direct effect of the drug on the nerve terminal."
