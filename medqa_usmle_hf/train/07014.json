The location of the pain and the fact that the patient plays tennis suggest lateral epicondylitis, commonly known as tennis elbow, which is caused by repeated wrist extension. Nerve compression at the elbow and bursal inflammation may also cause elbow pain, but they are less likely in this case. Excessive stress to bone can occur in conditions such as stress fractures, but it is not likely the cause of the patient's symptoms."

The patient\u2019s history of increased tennis playing suggests that he may have lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow. This is caused by repeated wrist extension movements that strain the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle insertion at the lateral epicondyle of the humerus. The pain is reproduced by supinating the forearm against resistance which puts further strain on this muscle. Nerve compression at the elbow, bursal inflammation, and excessive stress to bone are not typically associated with lateral epicondylitis."
