The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and CT scan results suggest that he has gastric outlet obstruction. Nasogastric decompression can relieve the obstruction and provide immediate symptomatic relief. Total parenteral nutrition can provide necessary nutrients while the obstruction resolves. Oral rehydration therapy and early refeeding can lead to further distension of the stomach, worsening the obstruction. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is not indicated in acute gastric outlet obstruction. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) is used in evaluating trauma patients for possible internal bleeding and is not indicated in this case."
