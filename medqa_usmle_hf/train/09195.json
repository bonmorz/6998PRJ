The symptoms described are consistent with pemphigus vulgaris, which is characterized by the deposition of IgG autoantibodies at the dermoepidermal junction. This leads to acantholysis, or separation of the epidermis from the dermis, resulting in blister formation. Therefore, immunofluorescence studies of a perilesional skin biopsy specimen are most likely to show deposition of antibodies at the dermoepidermal junction."
