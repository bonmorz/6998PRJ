Mismatch repair is the process that corrects errors that occur during DNA replication and is linked to the development of colorectal cancer. Base excision repair is the process of removing incorrect or damaged bases from DNA, while nucleotide excision repair is the process of removing damaged DNA strands. Non-homologous end joining is the process of repairing double-stranded DNA breaks, and this process is not typically linked to the development of cancer. Therefore, the most likely impaired process in this patient is mismatch repair."
