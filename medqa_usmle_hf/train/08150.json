The bibasilar infiltrates suggest pulmonary edema. The drug being added causes urinary frequency, increased breast tissue development, and erectile dysfunction, all of which suggest inhibition of the mineralocorticoid receptor on the cortical collecting duct. This drug class helps reduce the workload on the heart by reducing blood volume and decreasing vascular resistance."

The side effects mentioned also match those commonly associated with spironolactone use."

Blocking this receptor will decrease the amount of sodium and water that the body retains, leading to increased urinary frequency and decreased fluid overload.
