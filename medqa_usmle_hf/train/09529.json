The presentation suggests that the patient may have viral encephalitis, and the lumbar puncture results support this possibility. Acyclovir is the first-line treatment for herpes simplex virus encephalitis, which is one of the most common types of viral encephalitis. CSF culture and CSF PCR may also help in identifying the causative pathogen, but treatment with acyclovir should not be delayed until the results are obtained.
