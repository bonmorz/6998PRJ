Suprapubic catheterization or intravenous pyelography would not be indicated at this point, as there is no evidence of urinary tract injury.

The most likely cause of the microscopic hematuria is a urinary tract injury. Observation and follow-up is the most appropriate step, as the hematuria is mild and the patient is stable. Suprapubic catheterization or intravenous pyelography may be considered if there is significant concern for urinary tract injury, but not as a first step. Laparotomy is not indicated based on the current presentation."
