The morning stiffness, joint pain, and skin changes, as well as the positive ANA and sclerosis-related antibodies, suggest the patient has systemic scleroderma. Limited cutaneous scleroderma presents with skin changes on the face, distal limbs, and chest, which matches the presentation in this patient. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is diffuse cutaneous systemic scleroderma. Polymyositis and SLE can cause joint pain and fatigue, but they do not have the characteristic skin changes seen in systemic sclerosis."
