The blood-tinged fluid draining from both nostrils and the description of a clear ring of fluid surrounding blood on a gauze suggest that the patient has a basilar skull fracture with cerebrospinal fluid leak. Bilateral periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes) is a classic sign of basilar skull fracture. Cranial nerve XII palsy and numbness of upper cheek area are less commonly associated with basilar skull fracture. Retroauricular ecchymosis is associated with a mastoid fracture."

The blood-tinged fluid spontaneously draining from both nostrils, especially with a clear ring of fluid surrounding blood, is suggestive of raccoon eyes or bilateral periorbital ecchymosis. This can be caused by a skull base fracture or other head injury. Cranial nerve XII palsy would result in tongue deviation, not relevant to the symptoms presented. Numbness of upper cheek area is suggestive of a trigeminal nerve injury, which is not consistent with the presented symptoms. Retroauricular ecchymosis is suggestive of a basilar skull fracture, but this is not consistent with the presented symptoms."
