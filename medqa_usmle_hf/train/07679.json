The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest an inflammatory muscle disease, and the elevations in leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and creatine kinase concentration are consistent with this. Sarcolemmal MHC-I overexpression with CD8+ lymphocytic infiltration is the hallmark histologic finding for dermatomyositis, which is a type of inflammatory myopathy.

The patient\u2019s symptoms, along with the elevations in leukocyte count, ESR, and creatine kinase concentration, suggest that the most likely diagnosis is polymyositis. In polymyositis, there is sarcolemmal MHC-I overexpression with CD8+ lymphocytic infiltration, which is most likely to be seen on histological evaluation of a biopsy specimen of the deltoid muscle. Option A describes muscle fiber necrosis with rare inflammatory cells, which is not typical of polymyositis. Option C describes changes in muscle fiber type, which are not typically seen in polymyositis. Option D describes perimysial inflammation with perivascular CD4+ T lymphocytic infiltration, which is more typical of dermatomyositis than polymyositis."

The symptoms, especially the elevations in leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and creatine kinase concentration, suggest the patient has inflammatory myopathy.

Histological evaluation of a biopsy specimen of the deltoid muscle in polymyositis will show MHC-I overexpression and CD8+ T lymphocytic infiltration. Therefore, the correct answer is (B). Muscle fiber necrosis with rare inflammatory cells is seen in dermatomyositis. Relative atrophy of type II muscle fibers with hypertrophy of type I muscle fibers is seen in disuse atrophy. Perimysial inflammation with perivascular CD4+ T lymphocytic infiltration is seen in inclusion body myositis."
