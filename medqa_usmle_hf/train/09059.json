The symptoms listed suggest that the disease in question may be primary aldosteronism, which involves the overproduction of aldosterone. Increased aldosterone levels can cause hypertension and potassium loss, which can lead to cardiovascular disease. The first cardiac finding in affected patients is likely to be increased afterload and decreased preload, as a result of the hypertension and fluid loss caused by excessive urination. Therefore, the correct answer is (D)."

The symptoms described suggest a condition called Addison\u2019s disease, caused by mutations in the gene product that stimulates the production of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol is involved in controlling blood pressure and blood sugar levels. The first cardiac finding in affected patients would be a decrease in preload (the amount of blood that fills the ventricles of the heart during diastole) and an increase in afterload (the force against which the heart must pump blood during systole). Cardiac contractility remains unchanged. This is due to the decrease in blood volume and increased vasoconstriction caused by low cortisol levels."

The symptoms described suggest a disease called primary hyperaldosteronism, which is caused by excessive production of aldosterone by the adrenal glands.

The symptoms described suggest a possible diagnosis of primary aldosteronism, which causes excessive secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal glands. This can lead to hypokalemia and subsequently cause arrhythmias, so the first cardiac finding in affected patients would likely be an increased afterload due to impaired contractility. This is represented by option (D). Option (A) is incorrect because increased preload is not a typical finding in primary aldosteronism. Option (B) is incorrect because decreased preload and afterload is not a typical finding in cardiac disease. Option (C) is incorrect because increased contractility does not necessarily occur in primary aldosteronism."
