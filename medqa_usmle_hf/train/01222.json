However, for healthcare workers and other individuals with risk factors (such as being born in a country with high TB prevalence), a smaller induration diameter may also indicate a positive result."

A positive test result is indicated by an induration diameter of 15mm or greater in a person with no known risk factors for tuberculosis. However, for a person like this patient, with no known risk factors, the cutoff for positivity is an induration diameter of 10mm or greater. Therefore, the proper time to read the test is 72 hours and a positive test result is indicated by an induration diameter of 16mm or greater. None of the options given are correct, which highlights the importance of staying up to date on current guidelines and recommendations."
