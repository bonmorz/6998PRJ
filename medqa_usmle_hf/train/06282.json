Option B is the correct answer, as it matches the description of the medication's mechanism of action."

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have tissue-selective effects as they function as both estrogen agonists and antagonists in different tissues. In this case, the medication is prescribed to manage symptoms related to osteoporosis, and the mechanism of action is estrogen antagonism in the breast and estrogen agonism in bone. Option A incorrectly identifies the medication as an agonist in both bone and breast, while option C incorrectly identifies the medication as an antagonist in the cervix. Option D describes a different type of medication that is a partial agonist/antagonist in different tissues."

Option D is incorrect since it mentions the cervix and does not mention the breast, which is important in the context of this medication\u2019s mechanism of action."

In this case, the medication is prescribed for the management of symptoms related to osteoporosis, so it should have an agonist effect on bone. However, because the patient has a history of breast cancer, it should have an antagonist effect on breast tissue to prevent further growth of cancer cells. Therefore, the correct answer is (B), which is an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue and agonist in bone."

The medication prescribed for the patient is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), which is known to have different effects on different tissues.

This is important because even though the patient needs the bone protection and relief of menopausal symptoms, she also has an increased risk of breast cancer due to her age and gender. The medication helps manage her symptoms while minimizing her risk for breast cancer."
