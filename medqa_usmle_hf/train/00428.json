However, five hours later, she experiences neurological symptoms suggestive of intracerebral hemorrhage. This is a known complication of pulmonary embolism, likely due to increased intracranial pressure caused by hypoxemia. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension can also cause optic disc swelling but is less likely in this case.
