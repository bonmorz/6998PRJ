Increasing oral hydration and fiber intake, checking stool for fecal red blood cells and leukocytes, and beginning treatment with ciprofloxacin are not appropriate management options for functional abdominal pain in this case."

Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to be effective in managing functional abdominal pain in children, making it the most appropriate next step in management. Option A is recommended for constipation-related abdominal pain, but the child's stools have normal consistency and there are no other signs of constipation. Option B is unnecessary since there is no suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease. Option C is not indicated since there is no evidence of infection."
