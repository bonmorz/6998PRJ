The nasal polyp obstructing the superior nasal meatus suggests involvement of the posterior ethmoidal sinus, and the clear nasal discharge suggests chronic inflammation.

Option A involves the pterygopalatine fossa, which is not typically obstructed in cases of nasal polyps. Option C involves the nasolacrimal duct and eustachian tube, which are not typically involved in cases of nasal polyps. Option D involves the frontal sinus and anterior ethmoidal sinus, which are not typically obstructed in cases of nasal polyps."
