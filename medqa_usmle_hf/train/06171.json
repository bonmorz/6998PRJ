Intravenous clindamycin and oral primaquine are the most appropriate treatment for PCP according to current guidelines. Intravenous fluconazole is used to treat fungal infections, but PCP is not caused by fungi. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is also used to treat PCP, but it is not usually used alone for treatment of severe PCP. Prednisone is often used in combination with antibiotic therapy for severe PCP, but it is not the first-line treatment."

Fluconazole is used to treat fungal infections, but it is not effective against P. jirovecii. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the first-line treatment for P. jirovecii pneumonia, but the patient has a severe allergy to sulfa drugs. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is intravenous clindamycin and oral primaquine. Prednisone should not be used in the treatment of P. jirovecii pneumonia."

Intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole could treat both the PCP and a potential bacterial infection, but it is contraindicated in patients with sulfa allergies.

The patient has symptoms consistent with pneumonia and weight loss, which suggests possible underlying immune deficiency. The white plaques on the tongue suggest thrush or candidiasis infection. Based on these findings, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is intravenous clindamycin and oral primaquine. This combination can treat both community-acquired pneumonia and opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, which can occur in immunocompromised patients like this one. Intravenous fluconazole is an antifungal medication and would not effectively treat the patient's bacterial pneumonia. Intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole alone may not be enough to treat the patient's infections and weight loss. Adding oral prednisone may increase the risk of fungal infection."
