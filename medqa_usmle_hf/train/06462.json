The patient\u2019s blood work shows hyperglycemia, low bicarbonate levels, and high potassium levels, all consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA also causes total body potassium depletion due to osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia. Hypocalcemia and normal-to-high phosphate levels are not typically seen in DKA. The urine electrolytes would show a higher loss of free water than sodium in a patient with DKA."
