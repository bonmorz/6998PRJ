The presence of an air-fluid interface behind the translucent tympanic membrane indicates that there is still some fluid in the middle ear. It is best to observe and regularly follow-up as this condition usually resolves on its own within a few weeks without antibiotic therapy. Continued antibiotic therapy is not needed as the patient is already asymptomatic, and prescribing prednisolone is not recommended as it has not been proven to be beneficial in the management of acute otitis media."

The patient is asymptomatic except for mild fullness in the left ear, and the physical examination shows the presence of an air-fluid interface behind the translucent tympanic membrane and decreased the mobility of the tympanic membrane. These are indicative of a resolving acute otitis media. The current recommendation is to observe and regularly follow-up for up to 3 months to identify any treatment failure or recurrence. Continuous antibiotic therapy beyond 10 days is not recommended unless there is a high risk of recurrence or complications. The use of steroids is not recommended in uncomplicated acute otitis media."

The patient is asymptomatic except for mild fullness in the left ear, indicating that the acute otitis media has resolved. The air-fluid interface behind the translucent tympanic membrane and decreased mobility of the tympanic membrane suggest fluid accumulation in the middle ear. Observation and regular follow-up is the recommended option as the fluid may resolve on its own without antibiotics or other treatment. Amoxicillin-clavulanate or extended antibiotic treatment is recommended only if the patient shows signs of persistent or worsening symptoms after initial antibiotic treatment.

With these findings, observation and regular follow-up is recommended as the next best step, as the patient may have residual fluid or inflammation that may resolve on its own without the need for further antibiotic therapy. Continuing antibiotic therapy or adding a different antibiotic is generally not recommended in cases of uncomplicated acute otitis media, and oral prednisolone is not typically used in the management of acute otitis media."

Oral prednisolone is not indicated for acute otitis media. Observation and regular follow-up is the most appropriate next step, as some cases of otitis media with effusion can resolve on their own without intervention. It is also important to ensure appropriate follow-up to monitor for resolution or progression of symptoms."
