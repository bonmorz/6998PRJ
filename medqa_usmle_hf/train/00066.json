In this scenario, the most appropriate next step is to educate Mr. P about the risks of HCM and explain why it is not safe for him to play in the game.

It is not appropriate to have Mr. P committed or arrested, and it would not be ethical to allow him to play against medical advice without informed consent.

It is also important to inform the coach and team owner of the risks and advocate for Mr. P's health and safety. If Mr. P still insists on playing, it may be necessary to consult with legal counsel and consider removing him from the team to protect his health and prevent potential liability.
