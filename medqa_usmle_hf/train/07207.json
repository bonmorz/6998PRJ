The Pygmalion effect is the phenomenon where the expectations of a researcher or staff member influence the behavior of study participants, leading to biased results. In this case, the staff member is telling patients about the new implant and likely influencing their perception of pain outcomes. The Hawthorne effect is a similar phenomenon where study participants' behavior changes simply because they are being observed, but it is not relevant in this situation. The Golem effect refers to negative expectations influencing behavior, and Berkson bias refers to selection bias in hospital-based studies."

The Hawthorne effect, in contrast, refers to study participants altering their behavior because they know they are being studied. The Golem effect refers to the phenomenon where low expectations lead to decreased performance, and the Berkson bias refers to a selection bias that occurs when study participants from a hospital do not accurately represent the general population."
