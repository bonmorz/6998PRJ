This is consistent with a Pinealoma, which is a tumor of the pineal gland in the brain. Craniopharyngioma arises from the sellar/parasellar region, Ependymoma arises from ependymal cells in the ventricles, and Pituitary Adenoma arises from the pituitary gland."

The patient's symptoms, including progressively worsening headache, vomiting, and difficulty looking up, suggest an obstructive hydrocephalus, which is commonly caused by a pinealoma. The MRI image shows a mass in the pineal region, further supporting this diagnosis. Craniopharyngioma can also cause obstructive hydrocephalus, but it is located near the pituitary gland, not in the pineal region. Ependymoma and pituitary adenoma do not typically cause this type of obstruction."
