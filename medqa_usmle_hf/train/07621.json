Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18 are known to cause cervical cancer, and vaccination against them can reduce the incidence of cervical cancer. However, the vaccine does not protect against all types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer. Therefore, increasing vaccination rates could lead to a decrease in the number of true positives (i.e. fewer cases of cervical cancer caused by HPV 16 and 18), but also a decrease in positive predictive value, as the proportion of positive tests caused by HPV 16 and 18 will decrease relative to other types of HPV.

Since the HPV vaccine reduces the likelihood of HPV infection, there will be a decrease in the prevalence of high-risk HPV types, which can lead to a decrease in positive predictive value for abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) test results. This is because the positive predictive value is influenced by the prevalence of the condition being tested for in the population. With a lower prevalence of high-risk HPV, there will be a higher likelihood of false positive results, and thus a decrease in positive predictive value. The true negative rate, true positive rate, and negative predictive value are not directly influenced by changes in HPV vaccination rates."

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a risk factor for cervical cancer and certain strains, including 16 and 18, are known to cause the majority of cases. Vaccination against these strains would lower the prevalence of HPV and therefore decrease the positive predictive value of the Papanicolaou test, as fewer women would have abnormal results. This is because the test is more likely to show false positives when there is a low prevalence of disease. The true negative rate and negative predictive value would increase, as fewer women would have HPV and therefore fewer false negatives. The true positive rate and sensitivity of the test would stay the same as the test is still detecting cervical abnormalities, although the prevalence of these abnormalities would be lower."
