The patient's symptoms suggest peripheral neuropathy, which is commonly associated with diabetes, smoking, and high cholesterol. The decreased sensation to pinprick, light touch, and vibration, as well as the ankle jerk reflex being 1+, suggest peripheral neuropathy. The most appropriate next step in management is to start therapy to manage the neuropathic pain, which can be done with venlafaxine. Ankle-brachial index, MRI with contrast of the spine, and vitamin B12 therapy are not indicated in this case."
