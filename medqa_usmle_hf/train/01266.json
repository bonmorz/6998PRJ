The normal platelet count and PT suggest a defect in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, which is seen in Hemophilia A. Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder affecting connective tissue, Von Willebrand disease is a bleeding disorder that affects platelet function, and Bernard-Soulier disease is a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of the platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex. None of these conditions are as likely as Hemophilia A given the patient's presentation and lab results."

The coagulation test results are also consistent with hemophilia A, as the partial thromboplastin time is prolonged."

The presentation of an 18-month-old boy with swelling in his knee after physical activity, along with a family history of similar problems, suggests a bleeding disorder. The normal platelet count and the prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) indicate a coagulation factor deficiency, which is consistent with Hemophilia A. Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder affecting the connective tissue, causing abnormalities in the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems. Von Willebrand disease is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor. Bernard-Soulier disease is a rare, inherited bleeding disorder characterized by deficient platelet function due to a defect in the glycoprotein Ib/IX/V complex. None of these conditions fit the presentation of the patient."
