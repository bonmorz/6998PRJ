Diabetes and cycling can both cause damage to the pudendal nerve, which is responsible for sensation and function in the genitals. The fact that the patient is able to get erections and has morning erections suggests that the problem is not related to systemic disease or medication side effects, and the timing of the onset of symptoms coinciding with stressful events suggests a psychological component is less likely."

The patient\u2019s sexual dysfunction started after a stressful event, suggesting psychological factors may play a role. However, the fact that he is able to get an erection but cannot ejaculate suggests pudendal nerve damage, which can be caused by cycling. Medications can also cause sexual dysfunction, but the symptoms typically involve all aspects of sexual function rather than just ejaculation. Autonomic neuropathy is a possibility due to his diabetes, but it would not explain the specific symptom of inability to ejaculate."

The patient\u2019s ability to get and maintain an erection suggests that his reproductive system is functioning properly, making option A unlikely. Option C is also unlikely because citalopram is not known to cause ejaculatory dysfunction. Option D is plausible, but the patient\u2019s lack of libido or other psychological symptoms makes it less likely. Option B is the most likely explanation as cycling can cause compression of the pudendal nerve, leading to ejaculatory dysfunction."
