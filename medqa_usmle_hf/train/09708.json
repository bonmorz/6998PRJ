The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest patellofemoral pain syndrome, which is commonly caused by weakness or imbalance of the quadriceps muscles. Therefore, quadriceps strengthening exercises are the best option for definitively managing this condition. NSAIDs may help reduce inflammation and pain, but they are only symptomatic relief. Colchicine is used to treat gout. Intra-articular injections should be reserved for cases that do not respond to conservative treatment."
