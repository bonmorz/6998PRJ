The unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia suggests that the most likely defect is reduced UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity. This enzyme is important for bilirubin conjugation and excretion. Phenobarbital induces the enzyme and can help with reducing bilirubin levels. Option (A) is another possible cause of hyperbilirubinemia, but absent UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity is more commonly associated with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Option (B) refers to mutations in transporters that affect bilirubin excretion, which is less likely in this case as the patient has unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
