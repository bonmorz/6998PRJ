The symptoms of low-grade fever, itchy rash, and joint pain suggest a serum sickness-like reaction, which is a type III hypersensitivity reaction that can occur after exposure to drugs like amoxicillin. The annular plaques with central clearing also support this diagnosis, as it is a common skin manifestation. Stevens-Johnson syndrome usually involves mucous membranes and is associated with more severe skin involvement. Pemphigus vulgaris is a rare autoimmune disorder affecting the skin and mucous membranes, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms usually involves fever, rash, and eosinophilia."

The annular plaques with central clearing are also a characteristic feature of this reaction. Stevens-Johnson syndrome presents with more severe mucocutaneous involvement, while Pemphigus vulgaris presents with painful, flaccid bullae. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) typically presents with fever, rash, and eosinophilia but also involves internal organs like the liver or kidneys, which is not seen in this case."
