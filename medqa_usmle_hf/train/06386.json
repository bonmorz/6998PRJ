The hallmark of this condition is hyperimmunoglobulinemia E and eosinophilia. The boy also suffers from recurrent infections and takes antibiotic chemoprophylaxis. The characteristic symptoms of this condition are eosinophilia, eczema, and recurrent skin and lung infections, all of which are present in option B. Hay fever and bronchial asthma are not typically associated with this syndrome (not included in any options). Atopic dermatitis may be present, but it is not as characteristic as eczema.
