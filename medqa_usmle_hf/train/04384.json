The presentation of non-pitting edema with rough, thick, and indurated skin suggests lymphedema, which can be caused by obstruction of lymphatic channels. The travel history to Kenya also increases the likelihood of parasitic infections, which can also cause lymphatic obstruction. Persistent elevation of venous pressures and venous thromboembolism would typically present with pitting edema and are less likely causes in this scenario.
