The patient's elevated potassium and normal anion gap indicate hyperkalemia, which is a potential side effect of certain medications such as ACE inhibitors or potassium-sparing diuretics. The fact that the patient recently started a new supplement and is taking medication for his comorbidities suggests that medication is a likely cause. Dietary changes or rhabdomyolysis would not typically cause hyperkalemia. Hemolysis would result in a decrease in serum haptoglobin and an increase in indirect bilirubin, which are not included in the laboratory values provided."

The patient's elevated potassium levels (hyperkalemia) are a concerning finding in a patient with a history of myocardial infarction and hypertension. Medication use is the most likely cause, as some medications commonly used in this patient population (such as ACE inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists) can cause hyperkalemia. It is important to review the patient's medication regimen and adjust as needed. Dietary changes and rhabdomyolysis are possible causes of hyperkalemia, but are less likely given the patient's presentation and history. Hemolysis is not a likely cause, as there are no abnormal findings in the patient's complete blood count or other laboratory values."

Since the patient denies shortness of breath, it is unlikely caused by rhabdomyolysis. Hemolysis can cause hyperkalemia, but there is no evidence of hemolysis in the question stem. Dietary changes alone are unlikely to cause such a significant electrolyte abnormality. Therefore, medication is the most likely cause, and the patient\u2019s history of diabetes and hypertension suggests that he is taking medications that can cause hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Further investigation and management of the hyperkalemia is needed to avoid serious complications."
