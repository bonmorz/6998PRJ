The abrupt stopping of talking can also be a sign of psychosis. Schizophrenia requires a minimum duration of 6 months, so it is not the most likely diagnosis. Schizophreniform disorder also requires a shorter duration than the patient\u2019s symptoms. Schizotypal personality disorder involves mild symptoms of psychosis without the presence of delusions or hallucinations."

The combination of these symptoms is suggestive of schizoaffective disorder. Schizophrenia is a possibility, but the presence of mood disorder symptoms supports the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder instead. Schizophreniform disorder requires symptoms to be present for at least 1 month and the patient has been experiencing them for 4 months, making this diagnosis less likely. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by eccentric behavior and social discomfort, which are not prominent features in this case."
