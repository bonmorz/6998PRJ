A plain abdominal X-ray is not useful for evaluating hematuria. A 24-hour urine collection test is used to measure protein and creatinine levels and is not helpful in identifying the cause of hematuria. A repeat urinalysis in 6 months is too long to wait to evaluate hematuria. An intravenous pyelogram is an imaging test that can help identify the cause of hematuria, such as a kidney stone or tumor. It is the most appropriate next step in management in this patient."
