The description of the rash suggests that the boys have scabies, which is caused by a mite that burrows under the skin. The most common complication of scabies is bacterial superinfection of skin lesions, as the skin is already compromised by the mite infestation. While rare, scabies can also lead to encephalitis or cerebellar ataxia, but these are more severe complications and not as common as bacterial superinfection. Pneumonia is not a complication of scabies."
