Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is reassurance and education about TB prevention, as well as continued monitoring of symptoms and follow-up TST or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) testing. A chest x-ray may be ordered if symptoms persist or worsen. Repeat TST after 6-8 weeks is not necessary as it doesn't change the management plan in this case."
