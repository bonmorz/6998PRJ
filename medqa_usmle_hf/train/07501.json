The presence of multiple bruises, retinal hemorrhages, and a subdural hemorrhage in a young child with a history of a fall is highly concerning for non-accidental trauma, also known as child abuse. Informing child protective services is the most important follow-up plan to ensure the safety and well-being of the child. Providing parents with anticipatory guidance or reassurance that accidents are common would not be appropriate in this situation. Referral to genetics for further testing is also not relevant to this presentation."
