The patient had a liver transplantation and is currently on immunosuppressive drugs, making him susceptible to infections. However, the abdominal pain and jaundice suggest a liver-related issue. Ultrasound of the liver is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis as it can evaluate the liver for any abnormalities such as bile duct obstruction or graft rejection. CT scan of the abdomen with contrast may be used if the ultrasound is inconclusive. Viral loads may be useful in immunocompetent individuals, but in this case, the assumption is that the patient may have a suppressed immune response. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is not relevant to the patient's symptoms."
