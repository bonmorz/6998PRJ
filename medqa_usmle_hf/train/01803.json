The region labeled with an arrow corresponds to the germinal center, which is where B cells undergo isotype switching, a process in which they change their antibody class from IgM to other classes such as IgG, IgA, or IgE. Macrophage activation occurs outside of the lymph node, usually in tissues or at the site of infection. Negative selection occurs in the thymus, not in lymph nodes. V(D)J recombination occurs during B and T cell development in the bone marrow and thymus, respectively."

The region labeled with an arrow is the germinal center, where B cells undergo isotype switching to produce different classes of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, etc.) with different effector functions. This process is essential for mounting an effective adaptive immune response. Macrophage activation occurs when macrophages encounter pathogens or other foreign substances. Negative selection occurs in the thymus, where immature T cells that recognize self-antigens are eliminated to prevent autoimmunity. V(D)J recombination occurs during the development of B and T cells, when gene segments are rearranged to produce a diverse repertoire of antigen receptors."

The region labeled with an arrow appears to be the germinal center, which is responsible for B-cell proliferation, somatic hypermutation, and isotype switching. Isotype switching involves changing the class of antibody produced to better target a specific pathogen. Macrophage activation occurs when macrophages are exposed to stimuli from microorganisms or injured tissues. Negative selection occurs in the thymus, where T-cells are selected against self-antigens. V(D)J recombination occurs during lymphocyte development and is necessary for the generation of antibody diversity."
