Since the patient is planning to become pregnant, her current medication, methimazole, is not recommended due to its teratogenic effects. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is an alternative medication that is safe for pregnancy but has a higher risk of fulminant hepatic necrosis compared to methimazole, which is a possible side effect that was not a risk with her old medication. Agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia are potential side effects of both medications, while thyroid storm is a risk in both Graves disease and during pregnancy with hyperthyroidism, regardless of medication choice."

Agranulocytosis is a possible side effect of methimazole, which may be the patient\u2019s current medication. Aplastic anemia is a rare but serious side effect of both methimazole and propylthiouracil, two medications used to treat Graves disease. Thyroid storm is a potential complication of both old and new medication if the patient does not properly manage her thyroid levels during pregnancy."

The patient needs to switch medications because her current medication, which is likely methimazole or propylthiouracil, can cause congenital anomalies.
