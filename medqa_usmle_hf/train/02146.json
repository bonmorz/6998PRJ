The rash, pain, and timing of occurrence suggest herpes zoster (shingles), which can be serious in immunocompromised patients. The patient\u2019s recent Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma diagnosis and chemotherapy also support the idea that the patient is immunocompromised. Acyclovir is the most appropriate treatment for herpes zoster in immunocompromised patients. Penicillin V is used to treat bacterial infections, permethrin is used to treat scabies, and ceftriaxone is used to treat bacterial infections like meningitis and gonorrhea, none of which are appropriate for this situation."
