The symptoms described for the patient suggest that he has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a frameshift mutation in the DMD gene that leads to the production of a non-functional or truncated dystrophin protein. Therefore, choice (A) frameshift is the correct answer. Missense mutations involve a change in one amino acid, nonsense mutations produce an early stop codon, and splice site mutations affect the splicing of introns and exons, none of which typically cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy."
