The patient is presenting with symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) - cough, dyspnea on exertion, pink frothy sputum, bilateral pitting pedal edema, and fine crepitations over the lung bases. The absence of air bronchograms and presence of Kerley lines on chest radiograph are also indicative of CHF. The drug that reduces preload and can rapidly improve symptoms is a loop diuretic like furosemide, which reduces fluid overload and congestion in the lungs. Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used for hypertension and CHF, but it works by reducing afterload rather than preload. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside used for atrial fibrillation and systolic heart failure, but it works by improving contractility rather than reducing preload. Tolvaptan is a selective vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist used to treat hyponatremia, but it is not indicated for CHF."
