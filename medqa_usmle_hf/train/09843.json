Decreasing their number would result in delayed repolarization. Option (A) is incorrect because decreasing potassium channels would not affect resting membrane potential, which is primarily determined by sodium-potassium pumps. Options (C) and (D) are also incorrect as they involve changes in depolarization, which is primarily determined by sodium and calcium channels."

By decreasing the number of these channels, repolarization is delayed, leading to a longer action potential duration. This would be represented by a prolonged ST segment and QT interval on an electrocardiogram. Choice (A) is incorrect because a decrease in voltage-gated potassium channels would not affect the resting membrane potential. Choices (C) and (D) are incorrect because a delay in depolarization or an acceleration in repolarization would not be expected with a decrease in voltage-gated potassium channels."
