The decision to perform surgery is based on the size of the defect, the presence of symptoms, and the Qp:Qs ratio (ratio of pulmonary blood flow to systemic blood flow). Among the options, only option B has a relatively small defect, without heart failure, pulmonary hypertension or growth failure, and requires surgical repair. Option A has a muscular defect, but it is large in size, and hence requires surgery. Option C has a small membranous defect and no symptoms and does not require surgery. Option D has a muscular defect, but it is large and has severe pulmonary vascular disease, which may complicate surgery, and further management of pulmonary hypertension is required before the surgery is performed."

All 5 children have identical congenital heart defects with a loud holosystolic murmur over the third intercostal space at the left sternal border, suggesting ventricular septal defects (VSDs). VSDs are classified based on location, with the most common being perimembranous VSDs. Options A and D have muscular defects, and Option C has a membranous defect, but Option B has supracristal defect, which is not a VSD, but rather a ventricular septal aneurysm, which requires surgical closure to prevent the risk of lethal arrhythmias due to underlying fibrosis or scarring."
