The patient's symptoms suggest rheumatoid arthritis, which is characterized by symmetric joint swelling, erosions, and decalcification. Additionally, the patient reports feeling down and experiencing fatigue, which may be attributed to the presence of an autoimmune disease. The most likely mechanism of her reaction is a Type III immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, which is characterized by the deposition of immune complexes in tissues and subsequent inflammation."

Type II cytotoxic hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by antibodies that target specific cells or tissues, such as in the case of hemolytic anemia. Type IV cell-mediated reactions are not antibody mediated but involve T cell responses to antigens."
