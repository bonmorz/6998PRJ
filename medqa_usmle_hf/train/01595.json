Aggressive fluid resuscitation will increase the filling pressure of the heart, leading to increased cardiac output. However, the systemic vascular resistance will still be high as part of the body's compensation mechanism. The pulmonary artery wedge pressure will decrease as a result of the decrease in blood volume. Therefore, the most likely hemodynamic parameters for this patient would be a decreased cardiac output, increased systemic vascular resistance, and decreased pulmonary artery wedge pressure, which is option (C)."

Aggressive fluid resuscitation is the right course of action, but this can cause fluid overload, leading to pulmonary edema. Therefore, the pulmonary artery wedge pressure is likely to decrease while the systemic vascular resistance will increase due to the body's compensatory mechanisms. Cardiac output will also likely decrease. Therefore, the correct answer is (C)."
