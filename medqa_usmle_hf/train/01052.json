The symptoms of chest pain and difficulty breathing, along with the positive pregnancy test, increase suspicion for PE. The next best step in diagnosis would be a ventilation-perfusion scan (V/Q scan), which is a non-invasive test that can show if there is a blockage in the lungs. CT angiogram and ultrasound are also possible tests for diagnosing PE, but they are more invasive and have more risks associated with them. D-dimer is a blood test that can be used to screen for PE, but it is less specific and can give false positive results in pregnant women."
