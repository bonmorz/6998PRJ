The elevated bilirubin levels suggest the possibility of physiological jaundice, which is common in newborns and can be managed with phototherapy or observation.

The total bilirubin level is elevated, but the direct bilirubin level is not significantly elevated. This suggests physiologic jaundice rather than hemolysis. Therefore, observation is the best next step in management. Incision and drainage or neurosurgical decompression are not indicated as the cephalohematoma will slowly resolve on its own. Red blood cell transfusion is not indicated as the elevated bilirubin is likely due to physiologic jaundice rather than anemia."
