The patient\u2019s history of Crohn disease and ileocecal resection put her at risk for bile acid malabsorption, which can lead to the development of gallstones. The multiple echogenic foci with acoustic shadows on ultrasound suggest gallstones. Increased hepatic cholesterol secretion and decreased fat absorption may also contribute to gallstone formation, but they are not as likely in this patient given her surgical history. Decreased motility of the gallbladder can lead to biliary colic, but it is not as likely to contribute to the formation of multiple gallstones as decreased biliary concentration of bile acids."
