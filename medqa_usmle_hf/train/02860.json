The patient\u2019s symptoms and risk factors suggest that the most likely diagnosis is Squamous cell carcinoma, which commonly presents with difficulty swallowing and weight loss.

Zenker diverticulum may cause dysphagia, but the patient\u2019s smoking history and poor dental hygiene suggest a more serious etiology."
