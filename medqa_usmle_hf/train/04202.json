The patient's symptoms and history indicate a likely diagnosis of small cell lung carcinoma, which is strongly associated with paraneoplastic syndromes such as hyponatremia and neurological symptoms. X-ray and microscopic examination will confirm the diagnosis. Squamous cell lung carcinoma is associated with other symptoms such as hemoptysis and is less likely to cause hyponatremia. Large cell lung carcinoma and bronchial carcinoid tumor are also unlikely to cause the patient's symptoms."
