The question mentions that the drug inhibits a transporter on the basolateral membrane of proximal convoluted tubule cells, which suggests it\u2019s related to the reabsorption process. Among the options, only Glutamine is mainly reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubules and the inhibition of its transporter can lead to decreased serum glucose levels. The dipstick urine glucose test is negative because glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, so decreased reabsorption can lead to decreased serum glucose levels and no glucose in the urine. The urine anion gap is positive because the drug\u2019s inhibitory effect on the proximal tubule can lead to increased excretion of anions in the urine."
