The patient presents with symptoms of a sinus infection, such as nasal discharge and pain to palpation of the maxilla, worsened when bending over.

Amoxicillin-clavulanate may be appropriate if symptoms persist or worsen after 7-10 days or if there are signs of bacterial infection, but it is not the initial step. Amphotericin and debridement is used in severe cases of fungal sinusitis, which is unlikely in this patient given his symptoms and history. CT head is not necessary for the initial management of sinusitis."

Among the options, Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the first-line antibiotics for mild to moderate acute bacterial sinusitis. However, since the patient has a history of IV drug use and there is no evidence of severe symptoms like proptosis or vision changes, it is reasonable to start with conservative management such as pseudoephedrine and follow up in 1 week."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest acute sinusitis, which is usually caused by a virus and will often resolve on its own within a week. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in management would be to provide symptomatic relief with pseudoephedrine and schedule a follow-up appointment in one week. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is typically reserved for cases of bacterial sinusitis or severe symptoms lasting more than 10 days. Amphotericin and debridement would be indicated in cases of severe fungal sinusitis, which is unlikely in this patient. CT head is not necessary for diagnosis or initial management of acute sinusitis."
