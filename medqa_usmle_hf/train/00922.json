However, the shortened vagina and inability to visualize the cervix suggest the absence of M\u00fcllerian structures. This is consistent with M\u00fcllerian agenesis, which can lead to primary amenorrhea. 5-alpha reductase deficiency and Premature ovarian failure do not cause this specific manifestation, while Turner syndrome can cause primary amenorrhea but is usually associated with other physical characteristics."
