The patient is presenting with lower abdominal pain, vaginal spotting, a closed cervix, and a high serum \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin concentration. These are all signs of a possible ectopic pregnancy. The location of the hypoechoic lesion on transvaginal ultrasonography suggests that it is an interstitial pregnancy, which occurs when a fertilized egg implants in the muscular portion of the fallopian tube as it enters the uterus. Spontaneous abortion would typically involve open cervix and products of conception in the uterus. Incomplete hydatidiform mole is rare and presents with abnormal uterine bleeding and large-for-dates uterus. Placenta previa would present with painless vaginal bleeding."
