The conical protrusion of both lenses suggests Marfan syndrome. The presence of hematuria and proteinuria suggests a kidney disease, and the mild bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and the family history of kidney disease suggest Alport syndrome. Alport syndrome is a genetic condition caused by mutations in the type IV collagen genes, which would result in defective type IV collagen production. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is defective type IV collagen."
