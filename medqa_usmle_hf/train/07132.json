The patient's presentation is suggestive of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) which is an immune-mediated complication of heparin therapy characterized by thrombocytopenia and venous or arterial thromboses. The significant drop in platelet count on hospital day 5 supports this diagnosis. The erythematous and necrotic skin lesion in the left abdomen could be a sign of a thrombotic event. ADAMTS13 protease deficiency is associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) which can present with thrombocytopenia, but it is not associated with heparin therapy. Non-immune platelet aggregation is not associated with heparin therapy and is not likely to cause such a significant drop in platelet count. Protein C deficiency can cause venous thrombosis, but it does not typically present with thrombocytopenia."

The patient\u2019s symptoms (shortness of breath with exertion, mild chest pain, and lower extremity swelling) and laboratory results suggest he has developed thrombocytopenia and may have heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The erythematous and necrotic skin lesion may also be a sign of HIT. Antibodies to heparin-platelet factor 4 complex are responsible for HIT. The other options are less likely to cause the patient\u2019s current presentation. ADAMTS13 protease deficiency is associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which presents differently. Non-immune platelet aggregation is seen in reactive thrombocytosis or essential thrombocythemia, which are less likely given the patient\u2019s other symptoms. Protein C deficiency can contribute to thrombosis, but is less likely to cause the patient\u2019s thrombocytopenia."

The patient\u2019s presentation is consistent with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), as evidenced by the significant drop in platelet count and presence of a skin lesion. Antibodies to the heparin-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complex are responsible for the thrombocytopenia and coagulation dysfunction in HIT. None of the other options are consistent with this patient\u2019s presentation. ADAMTS13 protease deficiency is associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neurologic or renal dysfunction. Non-immune platelet aggregation is a finding in immune thrombocytopenic purpura, where antibodies bind to and destroy platelets. Protein C deficiency is a rare disorder that can lead to hypercoagulability, but does not typically present with thrombocytopenia."

The onset of thrombocytopenia, normal leukocyte count, and the presence of a skin lesion suggest heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which occurs due to the formation of antibodies against heparin-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complex. This leads to platelet activation and consumption, causing thrombocytopenia. Answer (B) is the correct choice. Other options, such as ADAMTS13 protease deficiency, are associated with disorders like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) leading to thrombocytopenia and microvascular thrombosis; Non-immune platelet aggregation is often seen in patients with Bernard-Soulier syndrome, and Protein C deficiency can lead to thrombosis, but there is no indication of these conditions in the question stem."
