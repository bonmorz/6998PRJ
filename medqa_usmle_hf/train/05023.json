Corticosteroids can be used in certain cases but not typically in the first trimester. Intramuscular benzathine penicillin G is used to treat syphilis but not in cases where the patient already tested positive in the past.

The patient has a history of multiple spontaneous abortions and positive VDRL, suggesting a possible history of syphilis. The elevated PTT suggests she may have an increased risk for blood clots, so the best next step in management would be to start low molecular weight heparin to prevent thrombotic events during pregnancy. Corticosteroids are not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of autoimmune disease. Intramuscular benzathine penicillin G may be given for syphilis treatment, but does not address the increased risk for blood clots. Vitamin K is used for clotting factor deficiencies, which is not the case here."
