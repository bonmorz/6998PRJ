The prolonged constipation, vomiting, and abdominal pain with distention suggest that the most likely underlying cause is malrotation of the gut.

Pyloric stenosis typically presents with projectile vomiting in the first weeks of life, and Meckel\u2019s diverticulum usually presents with acute pain that comes and goes."

The symptoms of persistent abdominal pain, worsening constipation, and vomiting, along with the absence of bowel movements and flatulence for 72 hours, suggest a possible obstruction. The upper abdominal distension and tympany suggest the obstruction is in the small bowel. Malrotation of the gut is the most likely cause as it can lead to a closed-loop obstruction. Volvulus can also cause a closed-loop obstruction, but it is more common in the sigmoid colon. Pyloric stenosis affects the stomach and is not likely to cause constipation. Meckel\u2019s diverticulum is a congenital abnormality that can cause obstruction but is unlikely to present with these symptoms at this age."
