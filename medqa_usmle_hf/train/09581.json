The patient has shortness of breath, diffuse crackles bilaterally, and low oxygen saturation, which suggest respiratory distress syndrome. The leukocytosis and fever suggest infection, and the intraoperative transfusion increases the risk of anti-leukocyte antibodies, but diffuse inflammatory alveolar damage is the most likely cause of the current condition. Increased left atrial pressures would cause pulmonary edema, which is not seen in the x-ray. Decreased chest wall compliance would not cause the other symptoms."
