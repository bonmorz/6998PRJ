The elevated LAP score suggests that the condition is likely to be a reactive process rather than a leukemic one.

Option C is incorrect as chemotherapy is not the treatment of choice for a reactive process. Option D is incorrect as anemia is not a common complication of leukocytosis."

Option A is incorrect because blast cells are not found in this scenario. Option C is incorrect as chemotherapy is not the first-line treatment for acute bacterial infections.
