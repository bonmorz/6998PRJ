The patient was started on a medication to treat nausea, which is likely to be a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist such as ondansetron or granisetron. Other options such as D2 receptor antagonists (metoclopramide, prochlorperazine) and H1 receptor antagonists (diphenhydramine) can also cause serotonin syndrome, but they are less likely to be used for nausea in this setting. M1 receptor antagonists such as scopolamine are not commonly used for nausea and are not associated with serotonin syndrome."
