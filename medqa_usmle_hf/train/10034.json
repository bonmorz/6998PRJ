The patient's blood pressure readings have continued to be elevated despite the cold being treated and no abnormalities found on physical or laboratory examination. Decrease in arterial compliance is the most likely underlying cause for this patient's elevated blood pressure. An increase in aldosterone production would be detected by laboratory studies, and medication-induced vasoconstriction would have resolved after the cold was treated. Decrease in baroreceptor sensitivity, while possible, is less likely to be the most likely cause in this patient."
