The patient has swelling in her arms and face, which suggests superior vena cava syndrome, a medical emergency caused by the obstruction of the superior vena cava by a malignancy, most commonly lung cancer in this age group. The mastectomy scar suggests that the breast cancer may have metastasized to the lungs. TB and constrictive pericarditis can also cause some of the symptoms, but they are not the most likely cause in this case. Nephrotic syndrome usually presents with edema in the legs, not the arms."

The patient's history of invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast and smoking history increase the risk of lung cancer. Symptoms such as headache worsening when leaning forward or lying down suggest increased intracranial pressure, which is commonly associated with lung cancer. Jugular venous distention and engorged veins on the anterior chest wall indicate superior vena cava obstruction, another complication of lung cancer. Pitting edema in both arms suggests bilateral lymphatic obstruction caused by malignancy, while axillary or cervical lymphadenopathy would suggest tuberculosis or other infectious causes. Constrictive pericarditis can cause edema, but it is unlikely given the patient's medical history. Nephrotic syndrome can also cause edema, but it would not explain the other symptoms."
