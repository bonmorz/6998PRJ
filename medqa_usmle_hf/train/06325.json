The patient presents with decreased breath sounds in the left lung base and an x-ray of the chest shows deepening of the costophrenic angle on the left side. These findings suggest pneumothorax, which can cause sudden increase in airway pressure. The most appropriate next step is insertion of a chest tube to relieve the pressure and remove the air or fluid from the pleural space. Administering levofloxacin or performing a CT scan of the chest is not the immediate management for pneumothorax. Close observation may lead to further deterioration of the patient's condition."

The patient likely has a left-sided tension pneumothorax, which is supported by the decreased breath sounds and deepening of the costophrenic angle.

Administering levofloxacin is not indicated at this time. CT scan of the chest may be done later, but immediate intervention is required for the tension pneumothorax. Close observation alone is not sufficient management for this patient."
