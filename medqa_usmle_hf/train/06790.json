Introducing solid foods also provides additional sources of nutrients, such as iron and zinc, which are important for growth and development. Continuing vitamin D supplementation is also recommended. Introducing cow's milk is not recommended until after 12 months of age. Therefore, option (B) is the most appropriate recommendation at this time."

Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first 6 months of life, and then complementary foods should be introduced while continuing breastfeeding until at least 12 months of age. Therefore, option (C) is correct. However, because the infant is at the 40th percentile for length and at the 35th percentile for weight, it is appropriate to introduce solid foods and continue vitamin D supplementation, as recommended in option (B). Cow milk is not recommended as a primary source of nutrition until after 12 months of age."

After 6 months, complementary solid foods should be introduced along with continued breastfeeding. The AAP also recommends vitamin D supplementation for infants exclusively breastfed or consuming less than 32 ounces of formula per day. Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation would be to introduce solid foods and continue vitamin D supplementation. Introducing cow's milk before 1 year of age is not recommended by the AAP."
