The medication being referred to is likely a bile acid sequestrant, which works by binding to bile acids in the intestine, leading to increased excretion of bile acids and increased demand for the liver to produce more, leading to consumption of circulating LDL-cholesterol. One of the potential adverse effects of this medication is fat malabsorption, which can lead to diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and decreased absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Gallstones are a potential adverse effect of another class of cholesterol-lowering medications (fibrates). Acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition associated with insulin resistance and obesity, but is not an adverse effect of this medication. Facial flushing is a potential adverse effect of niacin (another cholesterol-lowering medication)."

The medication being described is likely a bile acid sequestrant, which works by binding to bile acids in the intestine, forcing the liver to use cholesterol to make more bile acids.
