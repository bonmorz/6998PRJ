It acts as a DNA damaging agent by introducing free radicals into the DNA backbone, which then causes single-strand and double-strand breaks in DNA structure. DNA polymerase \u03b2 is involved in base excision repair pathway and is important for repairing DNA strand breaks. Therefore, bleomycin inhibits its activity by introducing strand breaks."
