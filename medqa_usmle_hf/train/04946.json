The abnormal nuclei seen on histologic examination are known as \"Owl's eye\" inclusions, which are a characteristic feature of PML. A proteinaceous infectious particle would suggest prion disease, which doesn't fit the imaging findings or patient history. An autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease would not present with the rapid onset of symptoms seen in this case. Autoimmune attack of myelin sheaths would be a possible cause of the white matter lesions seen on imaging, but the presence of deformed astrocytes and oligodendrocytes with abnormal nuclei suggests a viral etiology."
