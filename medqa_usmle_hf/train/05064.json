The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest eclampsia, which is characterized by seizures in pregnant women or those who have recently given birth. However, she has missed her menstrual period for 5 months and her hCG levels are high, indicating she may not be pregnant. The most probable explanation is gestational trophoblastic disease. Treatment for eclampsia and gestational trophoblastic disease is magnesium sulfate. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient is magnesium sulfate."
