The presence of a painful skin lesion with purplish irregular borders, in a patient with Crohn's disease and a history of corticosteroid use, suggests pyoderma gangrenosum.

Blastomycosis presents with respiratory symptoms and skin lesions that are usually painless. Basal cell carcinoma presents with a waxy or pearly bump that often has visible blood vessels and may have some central ulceration."
