Lead poisoning interferes with the production of heme and causes hypochromic microcytic anemia. In heme synthesis, aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen are produced in erythrocytes, but the production of porphobilinogen is inhibited in lead poisoning, while hydroxymethylbilane and protoporphyrin can still be produced. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) porphobilinogen."

The patient likely has lead poisoning, which can cause anemia, abdominal pain, and neurological symptoms such as hearing loss and poor school performance. The laboratory findings of basophilic stippling and Prussian blue staining of erythroblasts suggest lead poisoning.
