The rough endoplasmic reticulum is responsible for producing and transporting proteins, which include those needed for axon growth and regeneration. Therefore, its absence in the stained neurons would not show the axon, but still be able to visualize the soma and dendrites. Microtubules provide structural support and are found in the axons, so their absence would not explain the staining pattern. Nucleus and lysosome are not directly involved in axon growth and regeneration."
