The patient's symptoms suggest diabetic ketoacidosis, which can cause acidosis and electrolyte imbalances, including increased activity of the H+/K+ antiporter in \u03b1-intercalated cells in the kidney. This can lead to metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia. Option (B) is unlikely because the patient's electrolyte imbalance is hypokalemia, not hyperkalemia. Option (C) is incorrect because Na+/H+ antiporters are upregulated in diabetic ketoacidosis to help correct acidosis. Option (D) is also unlikely because hypokalemia leads to decreased activity of luminal K+ channels in principal cells."

DKA can cause increased acidity in the body, causing increased activity of the H+/K+ antiporter in \u03b1-intercalated cells in the kidneys, leading to H+ secretion and K+ reabsorption. This can result in hypokalemia, which can contribute to the patient's generalized weakness and ECG changes. Decreased activity of epithelial Na+ channels in principal cells in the distal tubules can also occur, leading to hyponatremia. Decreased activity of Na+/H+ antiporter in the proximal convoluted tubule can lead to metabolic acidosis, but it is not the most likely change to occur in this patient's kidneys. Increased activity of luminal K+ channels in principal cells can lead to hyperkalemia, which is not characteristic of DKA."
