The patient's symptoms suggest idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), and the MRI showed no structural abnormalities. The LP provides further evidence of IIH with a markedly elevated opening pressure. Acetazolamide is the first-line treatment for IIH and has been shown to reduce symptoms and improve visual outcomes. Furosemide is a potential alternative but is less effective and may have more adverse effects. Optic nerve sheath fenestration and ventriculoperitoneal shunting are more invasive treatment options reserved for patients with severe papilledema or progressive visual loss, and their efficacy in improving visual outcomes in IIH is not well established."

The symptoms and signs, including pulsatile headaches, elevated opening pressure on LP, and bilateral peripheral visual field loss, suggest idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

Option C (Optic nerve sheath fenestration) is a surgical treatment for IIH, but it is reserved for patients who have failed maximal medical management. Option D (Ventriculoperitoneal shunting) is also a surgical option for IIH, but it is reserved for patients with severe visual loss or those who fail medical management."

The symptoms, including vision problems, elevated intracranial pressure, and normal MRI, suggest idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The initial treatment for IIH is acetazolamide, which reduces the production of cerebrospinal fluid, and may ultimately relieve the symptoms. Option A, Furosemide, is also a diuretic that can be used to treat IIH, but acetazolamide is preferred. Option C, optic nerve sheath fenestration, and option D, ventriculoperitoneal shunting, are surgical procedures that may be used in severe cases or when medication is ineffective. However, they are generally considered second-line treatments after medication."
