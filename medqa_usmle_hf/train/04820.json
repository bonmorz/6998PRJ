Parietal pleural plaques are a characteristic finding in asbestos-related lung disease, which is commonly seen in shipyard workers who were exposed to asbestos fibers. Enlarged hilar lymph nodes can indicate an infection or malignancy, hyperinflated lungs with a loss of lung markings are seen in emphysema, and nodular calcium lesions in the apex of the lung can indicate a granulomatous lung disease like tuberculosis or histoplasmosis."
