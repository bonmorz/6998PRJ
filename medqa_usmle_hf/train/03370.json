The pale skin and thin, soft body hair also suggest malnutrition. Malnutrition puts the patient at an increased risk for fractures, which is the correct answer. Hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia are not directly related to malnutrition. Hyperthyroidism may cause weight loss, but it is not suggested in the given patient's history and physical examination."
