The patient has a history of spontaneous abortion and a reticular rash, which suggest the possibility of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The positive anti-beta 2 glycoprotein-1 antibody further supports this suspicion. APS is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis and recurrent pregnancy loss. Therefore, anticoagulation therapy is necessary. Aspirin and enoxaparin have been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent miscarriages in patients with APS. Heparin bridged to warfarin and warfarin alone are also options for anticoagulation therapy, but they are not first-line options in this scenario."

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to start the patient on a combination of aspirin and enoxaparin."
