The patient's symptoms suggest hyper-IgE syndrome or Job syndrome, which is characterized by an eczematous rash, recurrent soft tissue infections, and high levels of IgE. The deficiency of T helper 17 cells is consistent with this diagnosis. The increased susceptibility to infection is most likely due to impaired chemotaxis of neutrophils, as Job syndrome is associated with impaired neutrophil function."

Impaired actin assembly in lymphocytes can cause Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which presents with eczema, thrombocytopenia, and increased susceptibility to infections, but the patient does not have a history of thrombocytopenia. Impaired Ig class-switching in lymphocytes can cause hyper-IgM syndrome, which can also present with recurrent infections, but the patient\u2019s IgE level is elevated, not low.
