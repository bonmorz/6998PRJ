Based on the symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, fever, and neurological symptoms. TTP is caused by a deficiency of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease, ADAMTS13. Bleeding time may be prolonged due to thrombocytopenia. Splenectomy is not typically recommended for TTP. Plasmapheresis is the treatment of choice to remove the ADAMTS13 inhibitor and replenish it with fresh plasma containing ADAMTS13."

The combination of low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and neurological symptoms suggests thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The presence of schistocytes, helmet cells, and spherocytes on the peripheral smear further supports this diagnosis. TTP is caused by a deficiency in ADAMTS13 enzyme, not a sodium transporter. Bleeding time may be abnormal due to the low platelet count. Splenectomy is not the first-line treatment for TTP, and plasmapheresis is the treatment of choice to remove autoantibodies that are causing the thrombosis."

The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and peripheral smear findings suggest that the patient has thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).

Splenectomy is not the primary therapy for TTP. Plasmapheresis is the treatment of choice, as it can remove the autoantibodies that are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of TTP."
