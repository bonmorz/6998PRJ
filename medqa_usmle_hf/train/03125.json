The history of gradually worsening left knee pain with tenderness to palpation of the left anterior, superior tibia and pain with extension and limited flexion suggests traction apophysitis of the tibial tubercle. The x-ray shows a prominence of the tibial tuberosity, which is consistent with this diagnosis. Impingement of the infrapatellar fat pad would cause anterior knee pain, but not tenderness to palpation of the tibia. Chondromalacia patella usually presents with pain in the front of the knee, especially with activities such as climbing stairs or kneeling. Osteochondritis dissecans typically affects the medial femoral condyle or lateral tibial plateau and can present with locking or catching sensations of the knee."

The patient has tenderness to palpation of the left anterior, superior tibia and pain on extension of the left knee against resistance, which suggests traction apophysitis of the tibial tubercle. This is a common condition in preadolescent and adolescent boys and is caused by repetitive microtrauma to the tibial tubercle during running and jumping activities. The x-ray shows a secondary ossification center at the tibial tubercle, which is a normal variant in children and not necessarily pathological. The other options are less likely based on the patient's history and examination."

Infrapatellar fat pad impingement and chondromalacia patella are also possible causes of knee pain, but they are less likely based on the patient\u2019s symptoms and examination findings. Osteochondritis dissecans typically presents with joint effusion and MRI is more commonly used for diagnosis."
