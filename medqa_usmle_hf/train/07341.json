Treatment with H1 receptor antagonists, such as Benadryl or Claritin, can help alleviate the symptoms of the allergic reaction. Beta-lactam antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, while corticosteroids are used to treat inflammatory conditions, but neither are appropriate for an allergic reaction. Observation alone is not recommended as the symptoms can worsen, and prompt treatment is necessary to prevent anaphylaxis."

Beta-lactam antibiotics are not used to treat anaphylaxis, corticosteroids are used as an adjunct but not as initial treatment, and observation alone is not enough for anaphylaxis."
