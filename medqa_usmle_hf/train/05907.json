The increased platelet count (thrombocytosis) and bone marrow biopsy results suggest essential thrombocythemia, which is usually associated with upregulation of the JAK-STAT genes. The JAK-STAT pathway encoded by these genes is also responsible for the signal transmission of Prolactin hormone. Cortisol is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, oxytocin is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, and adrenocorticotropic hormone is also regulated by the HPA axis."
