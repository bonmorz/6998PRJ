The patient presents with a distended abdomen, easy bruising, and laboratory findings of low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated prothrombin time and INR, elevated total bilirubin, and elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase). These findings suggest liver dysfunction, which can lead to decreased liver synthetic function and subsequently decreased production of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) by the liver. Urinary loss of TBG due to nephrotic syndrome or acute hepatitis causing an elevation in TBG are unlikely in this patient given the provided laboratory values and clinical findings. Transient central hypothyroidism (sick euthyroid syndrome) can cause low serum thyroxine but is less likely given the patient\u2019s history of chronic alcoholism and intravenous drug use, which are known risk factors for liver disease. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) decreased liver synthetic function."

The patient has several symptoms and clinical findings that suggest liver disease, including a distended abdomen, easy bruising, and elevated liver enzymes. The low serum thyroxine is likely due to decreased liver synthetic function, as the liver is responsible for producing most of the body's thyroxine-binding proteins. Option A is incorrect as there is no mention of nephrotic syndrome or urinary loss of thyroxine-binding globulin. Option B is incorrect as acute hepatitis would cause a decrease in thyroxine-binding globulin, not an elevation. Option C is incorrect as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a more chronic condition, and sick euthyroid syndrome is typically a transient and self-limiting condition."

The patient's total bilirubin is elevated and his albumin level is low, indicating decreased liver synthetic function. The liver is responsible for producing thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), a protein that binds to and transports thyroid hormones throughout the body. Therefore, decreased liver function can lead to decreased production of TBG, resulting in lower serum thyroxine levels. This is different from option A, which suggests urinary loss of TBG in nephrotic syndrome, and option B, which suggests an acute elevation of TBG in hepatitis. Option C, transient central hypothyroidism or sick euthyroid syndrome, refers to a temporary decrease in thyroid function due to an acute illness or stress, but this would not explain the patient's other symptoms such as fatigue, easy bruising, and distended abdomen."
