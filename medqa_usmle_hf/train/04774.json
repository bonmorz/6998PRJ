Splitting is a defense mechanism where the individual sees the world as either all good or all bad, with no middle ground.

Repression involves pushing unpleasant thoughts or memories into the unconscious and is not exhibited in this scenario. Suppression is a conscious effort to push away unpleasant thoughts or memories and is also not exhibited in this scenario. Regression involves reverting back to childlike behavior in response to stress, which is also not exhibited in this scenario."
