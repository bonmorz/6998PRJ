The patient has no history of bleeding disorder, but the laboratory results show a prolonged PTT without correction on a mixing study, which suggests the presence of an inhibitor.

The normal PT and prolonged PTT with no correction after mixing studies suggest the presence of an inhibitor or autoantibody, which is likely causing the bleeding disorder. Warfarin toxicity would prolong the PT but not the PTT. Deficiency of a coagulation factor or von Willebrand factor would cause both a prolonged PT and PTT, which is not seen in this case."

The normal bleeding time and PT suggest that the patient's symptoms are not caused by a deficiency in a coagulation factor or warfarin toxicity. The prolonged PTT suggests a possible deficiency in clotting factors, but the mixing studies show no change, indicating that it is not a factor deficiency. Therefore, the most likely cause is the production of an autoantibody, such as in hemophilia A or B. The patient may have an underlying bleeding disorder that predisposes him to bruising and bleeding. Additional testing, such as factor assays or genetic testing, may be needed to confirm the diagnosis."
