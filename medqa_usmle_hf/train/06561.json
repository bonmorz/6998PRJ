The patient is presenting with acute decompensated heart failure with a reduced EF, and is currently receiving treatment with dobutamine and furosemide.

Decreasing the furosemide rate may worsen pulmonary edema, and decreasing the dobutamine rate may lead to worsening heart failure. Resuming home metoprolol may also worsen the patient's condition. The best next step would be to decrease positive inspiratory pressure, which could help decrease the patient's work of breathing and improve oxygenation without worsening hypotension."

The patient has symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and the treatment plan involves dobutamine and furosemide to manage pulmonary edema and improve cardiac output. However, the development of hypotension and oliguria suggests that the positive inspiratory pressure from BiPAP is affecting preload too much. Therefore, decreasing the positive inspiratory pressure is the best next step in management to improve cardiac output and decrease the risk of further hypotension. Resuming home metoprolol may worsen the patient's condition, decreasing furosemide rate may not help resolve the pulmonary edema, and decreasing dobutamine rate may worsen cardiac output."
