The fact that she is using less heroin since starting the analgesic drug suggests it is an opioid, and the mechanism of action is likely mixed agonist-antagonist at opioid receptors. This type of drug provides pain relief but also has a lower risk of abuse compared to pure agonists."

The fact that the pain medication was able to control her pain and reduce her use of heroin suggests it\u2019s an opioid drug. The options consist of pure agonist, pure antagonist, mixed agonist-antagonist, and non-opioid pain relievers. The fact that the patient is able to reduce her heroin use suggests that the pain medication is not a pure agonist or antagonist. In addition, mixed agonist-antagonist opioids are often used for pain relief in patients with opioid dependence or addiction. Therefore, the most likely mechanism of action of the analgesic drug is a mixed agonist-antagonist at opioid receptors."

The patient is using intravenous heroin and is prescribed an analgesic drug, indicating that she is likely receiving opioid therapy for pain control. Among the options, only mixed agonist-antagonist at opioid receptors provides pain relief with less risk of abuse and addiction, and it can also reduce heroin use. Pure antagonists at opioid receptors will reverse the effects of opioids and are not used for pain control. Inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis is the mechanism of action for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are not typically used as the primary pain management for post-mastectomy pain. Pure agonists at the \u00b5-opioid receptor are more likely to cause abuse and addiction."
