The symptoms of the patient suggest schizophrenia, and the drug that is often prescribed for this is an atypical antipsychotic. Option A is a characteristic of chlorpromazine, an older typical antipsychotic that is associated with retinal deposits. Atypical antipsychotics like quetiapine, risperidone or olanzapine typically have less extrapyramidal symptoms, which rules out option D. Higher affinity for receptors (option B) and less sedation and hypotension (option C) are not specific to any one drug and do not necessarily apply to the drug prescribed for this patient. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) associated with development of retinal deposits."
