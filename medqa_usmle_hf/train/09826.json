The history of progressive fatigue and worsening shortness of breath and the presence of bluish discoloration and bulbous enlargement of the distal toes suggest the presence of Eisenmenger's syndrome. This syndrome is the reversal of an existing left-to-right shunt caused by a structural heart defect, which results in the presence of cyanosis and clubbing. Persistent blood flow between the pulmonary artery and descending aorta, known as a patent ductus arteriosus, is the most likely echocardiographic finding in this case. Options A, C, and D are not associated with Eisenmenger's syndrome."
