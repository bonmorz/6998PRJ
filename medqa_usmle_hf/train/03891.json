Donor T cells from the graft can also cause rejection, but C4d staining is negative, which makes it less likely in this case."

The patient is experiencing symptoms of graft dysfunction, which is often due to allorecognition with T cell activation. This can lead to acute rejection, which is characterized by tubulitis.

Donor T cells from the graft can also cause acute rejection, but C4d staining is negative, suggesting a different mechanism.

Drug-induced nephrotoxicity is possible but less likely given the timing of the symptoms. Donor T cells from the graft can also cause rejection but it is less common with cadaveric transplants compared to living donor transplants. Irreversible fibrosis of the glomerular vessels is a long-term complication of chronic rejection, which is not likely only 12 days after the transplant."

Allorecognition with T cell activation is the most likely cause of this rejection, as it is a common mechanism in renal transplant rejection. Drug-induced nephrotoxicity can cause kidney damage but is less likely in this case since the symptoms started after the transplant. Donor T cells from the graft can also cause rejection, but this usually happens earlier in the postoperative period. Irreversible fibrosis of the glomerular vessels is a consequence of chronic rejection, which takes months or years to develop, and is not likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms at this stage."
