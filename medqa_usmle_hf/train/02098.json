The symptoms suggest Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, which is characterized by blistering and desquamation of the skin due to Staphylococcus aureus releasing exfoliative toxins. The flaccid blisters that rupture easily and the erythematous moist skin are typical symptoms. Scarlet fever can also cause a rash, but it typically starts on the face and spreads to the trunk, and the patient also presents with a sore throat and fever. Pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid are autoimmune blistering diseases that are less common in children, and their clinical presentation is different."
