The presence of granular casts on urinalysis further supports this diagnosis. Chronic kidney disease would have a more gradual decline in renal function and would not present with sudden onset respiratory distress. Acute glomerulonephritis and acute pyelonephritis typically do not present with granular casts."

The fractional excretion of sodium being greater than 1% would indicate renal failure due to renal tubular damage. Therefore, the most likely cause of the abnormal urinalysis is acute tubular necrosis. The presence of muddy brown granular casts on urinalysis also supports this diagnosis, as these are indicative of tubular damage."

The urine output in 24 hours is low, and the laboratory findings show elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, suggesting AKI. The urinary findings of muddy brown granular casts are specific to acute tubular necrosis, the most common cause of AKI in hospitalized patients."
