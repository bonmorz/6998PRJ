Additionally, there is inflammation and bleeding of the nasal mucosa and tenderness over the maxillary sinuses. The presence of hematuria and proteinuria suggests renal involvement, which is common in GPA. Churg-Strauss syndrome and Sarcoidosis do not typically present with these symptoms, and although Immunoglobulin A nephropathy can cause hematuria and proteinuria, it is not associated with the other symptoms."

The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, also known as Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis. This condition is characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels, leading to organ damage and various clinical manifestations including sinusitis, joint pain, and renal involvement. The presence of hematuria and proteinuria is also consistent with renal involvement in the disease. Churg-Strauss syndrome is a type of vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized blood vessels, but is typically associated with asthma and eosinophilia. Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is a form of kidney disease that typically presents with hematuria and proteinuria, but is not associated with sinusitis or joint pain. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease characterized by the formation of granulomas, but is typically not associated with sinusitis or joint pain."
