The symptoms and physical examination findings suggest Hirschsprung disease, which is characterized by an absence of ganglion cells in the distal colorectum resulting in functional obstruction. This can lead to bowel distention and the presence of a mass in the rectum. The absence of distal gas on the abdominal radiograph is also consistent with this diagnosis. Malnutrition, myelomeningocele, and cystic fibrosis are not typically associated with these symptoms."
