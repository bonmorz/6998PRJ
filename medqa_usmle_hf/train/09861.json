The patient's history of intravenous drug use, the symptoms of fever, night sweats, shortness of breath, and the presence of a murmur and lung rattles suggest endocarditis caused by bacterial infection. Blood culture would be the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis as it can identify the bacteria causing the infection and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy. Procalcitonin, B-type natriuretic peptide, and CPK-MB are not specific for endocarditis and would not be the most appropriate diagnostic tests in this case."
