The patient\u2019s laboratory studies and symptoms (numbness and tingling, excreting only 20 mL in 6 hours) suggest tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS can cause hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia, which are seen in this patient\u2019s laboratory results. TLS can lead to acute renal failure due to precipitation of uric acid in the renal tubules. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s renal condition is precipitation of uric acid in renal tubules/tumor lysis syndrome."

The patient has developed paresthesias after chemotherapy, and laboratory studies show elevated levels of uric acid, indicating tumor lysis syndrome. This also explains the patient\u2019s renal condition, as precipitation of uric acid in renal tubules is a common cause of acute renal failure in tumor lysis syndrome. Deposition of calcium phosphate in the kidney (option A) is seen in patients with hyperparathyroidism. Intense renal vasoconstriction and volume depletion (option B) is more likely to cause prerenal acute renal failure. Pigment-induced nephropathy (option C) is seen in patients with hemolysis or rhabdomyolysis."
