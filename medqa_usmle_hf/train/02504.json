Option B is incorrect as removing the cervical collar without proper evaluation can worsen any potential injury. Option C is incorrect as the patient has significant tenderness and requires further evaluation. Option D is not necessary at this time as the patient is able to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation without intervention."
