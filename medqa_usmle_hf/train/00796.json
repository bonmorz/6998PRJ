The patient's symptoms, including chest pain, trouble breathing, red urine, and an abdominal MRI with contrast revealing hepatic vein thrombosis, strongly suggest Budd-Chiari syndrome, a condition in which a blood clot obstructs the hepatic veins, causing symptoms such as abdominal pain, liver enlargement, and ascites. Flow cytometry is used to test for the presence of an underlying underlying blood disorder or hypercoagulable state, which can contribute to Budd-Chiari syndrome. Peripheral blood smear can help diagnose blood disorders or infections. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is used to diagnose hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease. The sucrose hemolysis test is used to diagnose paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria."

The patient's history of red urine after intense exercise or excessive alcohol intake, along with the laboratory findings and MRI results, suggest a diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Flow cytometry is the gold standard test for diagnosing PNH, as it can detect the absence or deficiency of certain blood cell surface proteins. Peripheral blood smear and hemoglobin electrophoresis can help diagnose other causes of hemolysis, while sucrose hemolysis test is used to diagnose hereditary spherocytosis."
