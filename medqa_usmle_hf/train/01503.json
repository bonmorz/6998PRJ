Fracture of the distal radius can also cause numbness and tingling, but typically does not affect specific digits. Palmar aponeurosis tear and interosseous ligament rupture are less likely causes of the patient\u2019s symptoms."

The numbness in the medial 3 digits, inability to flex the lateral 2 digits, and tingling in the medial 3 digits on tapping the anterior portion of the wrist are all indicative of median nerve compression, which can occur in a lunate dislocation injury. An X-ray will help confirm the diagnosis. Fracture of the distal radius may cause wrist pain but not necessarily the numbness and tingling, and the inability to flex the lateral 2 digits. Palmar aponeurosis and interosseous ligament injuries are less common and would not cause the specific symptoms described."

The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with a lunate dislocation, also known as a perilunate dislocation or dislocation of the carpus.

X-rays can help confirm the diagnosis. Fracture of the distal radius is also a possibility, but it does not explain the numbness and tingling in specific fingers.
