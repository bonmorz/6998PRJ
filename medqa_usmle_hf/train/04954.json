The symptoms, including joint pain, thirst, increased urination, pale stools, and darkening skin, suggest a possible diagnosis of hemochromatosis.

Pyridoxine deficiency can cause neuropathy and ceruloplasmin deficiency can lead to Wilson's disease, but these do not explain all the symptoms. \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency can cause liver damage but does not explain the joint pain, thirst or darkening skin."
