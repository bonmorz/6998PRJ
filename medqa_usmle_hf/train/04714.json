The patient is experiencing supine hypotensive syndrome, which is commonly seen in pregnant women in late second or early third trimester. The symptoms are caused by compression of the inferior vena cava and decreased venous return to the heart when lying on the back. The most appropriate action is to have the patient lie in the left lateral decubitus position, which will relieve the compression and improve blood flow to the heart and brain. Performing the Muller maneuver or using an abdominal binder may not be effective. Elevating legs may exacerbate the symptoms."

The patient is experiencing vena cava compression syndrome, which can occur when a gravid uterus presses against the inferior vena cava while the patient is supine. To reverse this, the patient should lie in the left lateral decubitus position, which will relieve pressure on the inferior vena cava and restore blood flow to the heart and brain. The other options are either ineffective or potentially harmful. The Muller maneuver is a respiratory technique used to diagnose sleep apnea and would not be appropriate in this situation. Lying in the supine position and elevating the legs could exacerbate vena cava compression and worsen the patient's symptoms. Compression with an abdominal binder is not effective for vena cava compression syndrome and could potentially harm the fetus."
