Erythromycin is a commonly used antibiotic that can inhibit the CYP3A4 system and decrease the metabolism of drugs that utilize this pathway, such as statins like rosuvastatin. This can lead to an increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, the internist should be most concerned about myalgia as a potential side effect or interaction. Unstable angina due to decreased rosuvastatin metabolism is also a potential risk, but myalgia is a more common side effect. Metabolic acidosis and tinnitus are not known side effects of erythromycin."
