The most common cause of varicoceles is a compression of the left renal vein at the aortic origin of the superior mesenteric artery.

Unilateral failure of the left testis to descend into the scrotum would cause an undescended testicle, not a varicocele. Twisting of the spermatic cord, also known as testicular torsion, would cause severe pain and swelling, and would need immediate medical attention."
