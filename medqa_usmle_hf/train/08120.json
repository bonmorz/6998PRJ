The patient's elevated HCG levels suggest that the pregnancy was initially viable but that the embryo stopped developing. This is most commonly due to a chromosomal abnormality, most often trisomy or monosomy. 46XX is the most likely karyotype associated with this pregnancy as it is the normal karyotype for females. 45XO is associated with Turner syndrome and is unlikely to be present in a viable pregnancy. 47XYY and 69XXX are both very rare karyotypes and are unlikely to be associated with this case."

Among the karyotype options, only 46XX is relevant to this situation since it denotes a normal female karyotype. 45XO is Turner syndrome, which is associated with infertility and abnormal genital development. 47XYY and 69XXX are rare chromosomal abnormalities that can cause developmental disabilities but are not related to the current situation."
