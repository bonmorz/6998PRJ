The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest primary aldosteronism, which involves excess production of aldosterone by the adrenal glands. Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) is the most accurate test to determine unilateral or bilateral production of aldosterone. Bilateral adrenalectomy is not typically the first choice of treatment, and spironolactone therapy and right adrenalectomy require more information from AVS. Therefore, AVS is the most appropriate next step in management."

The patient\u2019s symptoms and blood work suggest hyperaldosteronism, and the CT scan confirms the presence of an adrenal mass. However, unilateral adrenalectomy is not always successful in treating primary aldosteronism, so adrenal vein sampling should be done to confirm lateralization before considering surgery. Based on the results, the appropriate next step would be right adrenalectomy. Spironolactone therapy may be used as a medical treatment option, but surgery is recommended for patients with an aldosterone-producing adenoma.

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest primary aldosteronism, which is confirmed by the high plasma aldosterone concentration and low plasma renin activity. The adrenal mass found on the CT scan is likely the cause of the aldosterone excess. Adrenal vein sampling is necessary to identify whether the aldosterone excess is from the right adrenal gland or the left adrenal gland, as this will determine which adrenal gland needs to be removed during surgery. Spironolactone therapy may be an option for patients who cannot undergo surgery, but surgery is preferred for patients with a solitary adrenal mass. Bilateral adrenalectomy is only considered in patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia."
