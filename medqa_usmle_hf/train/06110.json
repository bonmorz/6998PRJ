The patient's laboratory findings suggest iron deficiency anemia, which is often associated with anisopoikilocytosis, meaning there are variations in the shape and size of the red blood cells. Teardrop cells are typically associated with myelofibrosis. Degmacytes are fragmented red blood cells and are typically seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Echinocytes are red blood cells that have spiky projections on the surface and are typically seen in uremia or red blood cell membrane defects. None of these are likely to be seen on the peripheral blood smear of this patient with iron deficiency anemia."
