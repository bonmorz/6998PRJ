Febuxostat is also an immunosuppressant, so taking it together with the purine analog can increase toxicity. Pemetrexed, rasburicase, and hydroxyurea are not immunosuppressants and are not likely to interact with the purine analog in this way."

The question describes a situation where a patient with Crohn disease takes methotrexate and switches to a purine analog drug to increase the chance of conception. Febuxostat is a medication used to treat gout, and it inhibits xanthine oxidase, which can increase purine levels in the body, leading to purine analog toxicity. Therefore, it is the most likely medication to increase the toxicity of the newly prescribed drug."
