Abdominal guarding, tenderness, and rebound tenderness suggest abdominal trauma, which can cause hypovolemia and decreased RPF. There is no mention of any conditions that affect GFR in this patient, so it is reasonable to assume that GFR remains unchanged. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Decreased RPF and no change in GFR."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest hypovolemic shock, which would decrease renal plasma flow (RPF) due to decreased blood volume, and also decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR) due to decreased renal perfusion pressure. However, in hypovolemic shock, there is a compensatory mechanism that maintains GFR, and therefore, option (B) and (C) are not correct. Option (D) is also incorrect as there would be some change in RPF and GFR in hypovolemic shock, and the most likely change is a decreased RPF and no change in GFR, as seen in option (A)."

The patient's symptoms, such as abdominal guarding and tenderness, suggest that he has suffered some sort of trauma that may have resulted in decreased renal plasma flow (RPF) and no change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The decrease in RPF could be due to a decrease in blood volume or due to a compensatory vasoconstriction of the renal vasculature in response to the systemic hypotension. However, there is no reason to believe that there would be an increase in GFR, so options B and C are unlikely. Option D is incorrect because it assumes there are no changes to either RPF or GFR, which is unlikely given the patient's condition. Therefore, the answer is A - decreased RPF and no change in GFR."
