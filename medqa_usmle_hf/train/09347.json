Increasing the tidal volume can lead to an increase in ventilator-induced lung injury and is not recommended.

The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), based on his clinical presentation and radiographic findings. The best approach to treat ARDS is to improve tissue oxygen delivery, and this can be accomplished by increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to recruit collapsed alveoli and improve oxygenation. Prone positioning of the patient can also help improve oxygenation in some cases, but increasing the tidal volume can lead to possible lung injury, and transfusion of red blood cells is not indicated unless the patient has severe anemia. Thus, the most appropriate next step is to increase the positive end-expiratory pressure."
