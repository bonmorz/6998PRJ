Intubation may be necessary if the patient's mental status deteriorates, but it is not the next best step in the treatment of his long QT syndrome.

Treatment should include correcting any electrolyte imbalance and administering IV magnesium and/or IV calcium gluconate. Among the options, calcium gluconate is the most appropriate choice as it directly improves myocardial contraction and can reverse the effects of calcium channel blocker toxicity, which could be a possibility given the patient's history of substance abuse.
