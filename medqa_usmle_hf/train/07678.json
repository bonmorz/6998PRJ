The patient\u2019s presentation is consistent with a severe case of ulcerative colitis, which can lead to toxic megacolon. A plain abdominal radiograph can help confirm the diagnosis of toxic megacolon and determine the need for urgent surgical intervention. Abdominal CT with IV contrast is not the first line imaging modality for this condition. Colectomy is a possible treatment, but only after the severity of the condition has been established. Contrast enema is not practical in this case as it carries a risk of perforation."

The patient's symptoms, history of ulcerative colitis, and laboratory values suggest acute exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. Plain abdominal radiograph is the most appropriate initial diagnostic test for evaluating patients with suspected acute colonic inflammation. It will help identify any features that suggest colonic dilatation or obstruction, which are indications for urgent intervention such as colectomy. Abdominal CT with IV contrast may be necessary in cases where the plain radiograph is equivocal or further evaluation of the extent and severity of colonic inflammation is required. Contrast enema is contraindicated in patients with suspected toxic megacolon."
