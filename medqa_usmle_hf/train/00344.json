The presence of vesiculopustular lesions on the hands and wrist reinforces this diagnosis. Lyme arthritis is usually associated with a single swollen, painful joint and a history of tick exposure. Acute rheumatic fever typically involves multiple joints and occurs 2-4 weeks after a streptococcal infection. Reactive arthritis typically occurs 2-4 weeks after a gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection and typically affects the lower extremities."
