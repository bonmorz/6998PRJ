Option B describes the mechanism of action of antipsychotic medications like chlorpromazine. Option D is not related to the pathophysiology of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The correct answer is option C because blocking the ryanodine receptor on the sarcoplasmic reticulum can improve muscle rigidity and hyperthermia associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome."
