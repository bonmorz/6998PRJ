The patient showed symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, including abnormal behavior, involuntary movements, difficulty remembering, and confusion. The jerking of limbs is likely due to myoclonus. The periodic spike and slow waves on EEG and the presence of protein 14-3-3 in CSF support this diagnosis. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis may cause confusion and disorientation but typically presents with weakness or numbness of the limbs. Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid gland and usually does not cause neurological symptoms. Herpes viral encephalitis may cause confusion, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and altered consciousness, but the MRI is often abnormal and the CSF findings are different."

The patient's symptoms, including abnormal behavior, involuntary movements, memory loss, and confusion, suggest a neurological disorder. The periodic spike and slow waves on EEG and positive protein 14-3-3 in the cerebrospinal fluid suggest Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by prion proteins. The MRI being nondiagnostic is also typical for this disease. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is an immune-mediated demyelinating disorder and Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland. Herpes virus can cause encephalitis, but the symptoms and diagnostic tests are not consistent with this diagnosis."

The periodic spike and slow waves seen on EEG and positive protein 14-3-3 in CSF are also suggestive of CJD. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis results in neurological symptoms and Hashimoto thyroiditis can cause cognitive impairment and depression, but neither presents with the specific symptoms and diagnostic findings described in this case. Herpes viral encephalitis typically presents with fever, headache, seizures, and altered mental status but would not show the characteristic EEG or CSF abnormalities of CJD."
