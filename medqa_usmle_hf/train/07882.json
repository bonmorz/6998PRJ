The thick white plaques on the baby\u2019s tongue suggest oral thrush, which is a fungal infection commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals. The fact that the baby received no prenatal care makes it more likely that the mother had HIV, and thus zidovudine (an antiretroviral drug) given during pregnancy and delivery could have prevented the baby's condition. Fluconazole is an antifungal drug used to treat thrush, but it would not prevent the condition. Penicillin G and rifampin are antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections and would not be effective in preventing thrush."
