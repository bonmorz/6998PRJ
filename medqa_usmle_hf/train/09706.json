The patient's decreased fetal movement and increased fundal height suggest the possibility of fetal distress, which needs to be evaluated.

Induction of labor or inpatient monitoring may be necessary based on the results of the biophysical profile. Oxytocin challenge is not recommended during pregnancy as it may lead to contractions and fetal distress."
