However, low-dose vaginal estrogen can be used for symptomatic relief of vaginal itchiness and pain with intercourse without increasing the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Oral estrogen carries a small risk of breast cancer recurrence and should be avoided in breast cancer survivors. Transdermal estrogen may be an option, but since vaginal symptoms are the primary concern, low-dose vaginal estrogen is the most appropriate choice."

Low-dose vaginal estrogen is a safe option for treating vaginal atrophy in women with a history of breast cancer. Conjugated estrogen orally and transdermal estradiol-17B patch are not recommended due to the increased risk of breast cancer recurrence. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate medical therapy for symptomatic relief in this patient."

Low-dose vaginal estrogen is the most appropriate medical therapy for symptomatic relief as it delivers estrogen locally to the vagina, without significant systemic absorption or increase in breast cancer risk. Conjugated estrogen orally and transdermal estradiol-17B patch may have systemic effects and increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Thus, they are not recommended for patients with a history of breast cancer. Option D may not be correct as the patient is interested in therapies for symptom relief, and low-dose vaginal estrogen can provide such relief."
