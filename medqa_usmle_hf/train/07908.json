The symptoms, including fatigue and shortness of breath, as well as the autopsy findings, suggest a diagnosis of cardiac and neurological involvement in a lipid storage disease such as Fabry disease or Pompe disease. Of the options given, only Pompe disease is caused by a GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion on chromosome 9. SOD1 gene mutation on chromosome 21 is associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); dystrophin gene mutation on the X chromosome is associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy; and SMN1 gene mutation on chromosome 5 is associated with spinal muscular atrophy."
