Lithium is associated with an increased risk of congenital cardiovascular malformations if taken in the first trimester of pregnancy. Therefore, it is recommended to discontinue lithium prior to pregnancy and use alternative medications. Lamotrigine can also be used, but switching medications is not the single most appropriate recommendation at this stage. Option (C) is incorrect because taking multivitamins can provide enough folate to prevent neural tube defects. Option (D) is incorrect because valproate is associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects."

Switching to lamotrigine or valproate may be options to consider, but the patient should first consult with her prescribing physician and a reproductive psychiatrist or obstetrician to determine the best course of action. The statement about neural tube defects is not relevant to this scenario, as it pertains to folate levels and not lithium use."
