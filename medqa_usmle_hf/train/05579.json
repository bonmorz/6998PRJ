The rusty nail suggests a risk of tetanus infection, especially since the patient cannot recall if he had a tetanus shot within the last 5 years. Therefore, administering both Td (tetanus and diphtheria) and TIG (tetanus immune globulin) is the most appropriate next step in management. Cleaning and dressing the wound alone won\u2019t provide sufficient protection against tetanus. Administering Tdap (tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine), which is more commonly given to adolescents, is unnecessary in this case as the patient is already 15 years old, and Td provides sufficient coverage."
