The patient is exhibiting symptoms of psychosis and the switch in medication suggests that her psychiatric condition could be worsening.

Electroconvulsive therapy is typically reserved for severe depression or other psychiatric disorders that are not responsive to medications. Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that is used in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, but it is not indicated for psychosis. Lithium is primarily used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and is not indicated for psychosis. Additionally, the patient's request for an abortion should be addressed separately and with appropriate counseling."
