The characteristic of neoplastic cells dividing faster than normal cells is due to the telomerase enzyme, which repairs the gradual shortening of chromosomal ends (telomeres) that occurs with each cell division. This allows neoplastic cells to continue dividing indefinitely, whereas normal cells have a limited lifespan. Protein kinase, reverse transcriptase, and topoisomerase are not specifically involved in chromosomal shortening or neoplastic cell division."

The characteristic of neoplastic cells dividing more rapidly than normal cells suggests that they are immortal or have a way to bypass normal cell senescence.

Therefore, the most likely enzyme involved is telomerase. Protein kinase is involved in cell signaling pathways, reverse transcriptase is used by retroviruses to integrate their genetic material into host cells, and topoisomerase is involved in DNA replication and repair, but none are specifically associated with maintaining telomeres."
