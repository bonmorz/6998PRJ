The decreased MHC class I expression means tumor cells can avoid T-cell-mediated killing, which depends on MHC class I presentation of tumor antigens. However, natural killer (NK) cells do not require MHC class I display and can kill cells without it. Therefore, NK cells are the most capable of killing tumor cells with decreased MHC class I expression."
