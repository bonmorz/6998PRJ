The patient was given a bolus of isotonic saline and started on intravenous insulin drip, but the potassium levels are in normal range and could potentially become low due to insulin therapy. Therefore, the next appropriate step in management is to give intravenous potassium chloride. Subcutaneous insulin glargine is not appropriate in this acute setting, intravenous sodium bicarbonate is not necessary as the patient's pH is only slightly low and will correct with insulin therapy, and intravenous 5% dextrose and 1/2 isotonic saline at this point would exacerbate the patient's insulin resistance and cause a further increase in glucose levels."

The patient is given a bolus of isotonic saline to correct dehydration and an insulin drip to lower blood glucose levels. The low HCO3- suggests metabolic acidosis, which can be treated with intravenous sodium bicarbonate. However, before this step can be taken, hypokalemia should be corrected with intravenous potassium chloride. Option (D) is not appropriate because it could worsen the metabolic acidosis. Option (A) is not appropriate because it only addresses hyperglycemia, not the metabolic acidosis."

The patient is presenting with signs of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including high blood glucose, positive urine ketones, and low bicarbonate levels. The bolus of isotonic saline helps to rehydrate the patient, and intravenous insulin drip is necessary to lower the blood glucose levels. However, the low bicarbonate levels and potential hypokalemia (low potassium levels) require treatment with intravenous potassium chloride. Option A, subcutaneous insulin glargine, would not treat the acute DKA episode. Option B, intravenous sodium bicarbonate, may be used in severe acidosis but is not the immediate next step in management. Option D, intravenous 5% dextrose and 1/2 isotonic saline, would not address the electrolyte imbalances and could worsen the patient's acidosis."
