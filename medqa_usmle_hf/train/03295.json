The presentation of vomiting with streaks of blood and a longitudinal mucosal tear in the distal esophagus on endoscopy support this diagnosis. Boerhaave syndrome is a complete rupture of the esophagus and would present with more severe symptoms. Pill esophagitis is caused by medication and Dieulafoy's lesion is a condition where there is a large tortuous artery in the wall of the stomach, not the esophagus."
