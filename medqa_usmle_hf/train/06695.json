The abdomen is distended and tender to deep palpation, and the uterus extends to the umbilicus, suggesting that the uterus is still enlarged and pushing on the bladder. Inadequate intermittent catheterization can cause urinary retention and overflow incontinence. Current or recurrent urinary tract infections can cause urinary frequency, urgency, and painful voiding, but not involuntary urine loss. Damage to nerve fibers can cause urinary incontinence, but there are no abnormalities on neurological examination."

The patient\u2019s history of two previous UTIs treated with nitrofurantoin, prolonged labor, and epidural analgesia increase the risk of postpartum urinary retention or incomplete emptying. Further examination findings such as a distended and tender abdomen suggest urinary retention which can cause overflow incontinence. Inadequate intermittent catheterization can help manage the urinary retention and prevent overflow incontinence."

Current or recurrent urinary tract infections or nerve damage do not seem to be the primary cause of her urinary incontinence."
