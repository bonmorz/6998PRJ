The features of the mass, including the multinodular, firm, mobile, and painless characteristics, suggest the possibility of a phyllodes tumor. The enlargement in size and the presence of cystic components on ultrasound support this possibility. A core needle biopsy would help to confirm the diagnosis. Fibroadenoma is usually small in size and does not progress rapidly. Breast abscess presents with pain, erythema, and fever. Fat necrosis usually presents with a history of trauma or breast surgery."

The patient\u2019s description of a smooth, multinodular, firm mass that has progressively increased in size over time, and the ultrasound findings of a hypoechoic mass with some cystic components that has increased in size, are consistent with a phyllodes tumor. Fibroadenoma usually has a well-circumscribed, mobile mass without cystic components, breast abscess is typically accompanied by redness and warmth, and fat necrosis is often associated with a history of trauma.

Breast abscess presents with localized erythema, warmth, and pus. Fat necrosis presents as a hard mass that may be tender and has skin changes like dimpling, retraction, or tethering."
