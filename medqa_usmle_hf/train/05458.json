Option (A) is incorrect as not all patients with delusional disorder will have concurrent psychotic disorders. Option (B) is also incorrect as there is no evidence in the scenario of a contributing medical condition. Option (C) is incorrect as the diagnostic criteria for delusional disorder specify that the delusion must be non-bizarre and involve situations that could conceivably occur in real life."

Option (A) is incorrect because not all patients with delusional disorder have concurrent psychotic disorders. Option (B) is incorrect because there is no indication that the patient has a contributing medical condition. Option (C) is incorrect because delusional disorder requires the presence of one or more delusions that persist for at least 1 month and are not due to the effects of a substance or a general medical condition."
