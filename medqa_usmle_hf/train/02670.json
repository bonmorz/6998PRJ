The low c-peptide level and recurrent fainting episodes suggest that the patient may have been deliberately induced hypoglycemia by the mother, indicating Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Munchausen syndrome involves the fabrication of illness or symptoms for oneself, while Munchausen syndrome by proxy involves the fabrication of illness or symptoms for another person. Somatic symptom disorder and conversion disorder involve significant physical symptoms without an identifiable medical cause, but they are not applicable in this scenario."
