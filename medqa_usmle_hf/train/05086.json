In this emergency situation, the physician has an obligation to provide life-saving care to the patient, regardless of religious beliefs. Therefore, the appropriate next step would be to provide transfusions as needed to stabilize the patient's condition. Asking the ex-husband to bring identification or obtaining an ethics consult may cause delays that could worsen the patient's condition. A court order may be obtained if all other efforts fail, but it should not be the first option in this emergency situation."

Therefore, the appropriate next step would be to provide transfusions as needed to stabilize the patient's condition, while continuing to communicate with the family and obtaining an ethics consult for further guidance. A court order for transfusion is usually a last resort and should only be pursued when all other means to respect the patient's autonomy and provide appropriate medical care have been exhausted."
