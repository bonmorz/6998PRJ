The patient\u2019s low serum sodium and high urine osmolality suggest the diagnosis of SIADH, which is commonly associated with lung cancer.

Normal saline is not indicated since the patient is already hyponatremic. Renin is not indicated as it is primarily involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is not likely the cause of the patient\u2019s abnormality."
