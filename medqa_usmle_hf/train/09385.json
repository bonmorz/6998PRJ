The patient presents with symptoms of hepatitis, which is also supported by the laboratory values of elevated liver enzymes, elevated bilirubin, and prothrombin time. Anti-HAV IgM antibody is the most appropriate laboratory test to diagnose hepatitis A, which is commonly transmitted through contaminated food and water, explaining the patient's frequent eating at a roadside restaurant. Plasma tyrosine and methionine are not relevant to this presentation. Urine for reducing substances is used to diagnose galactosemia, which is not a likely diagnosis based on the patient's history and presentation. Percutaneous liver biopsy is not the first-line diagnostic test and is reserved for cases in which the diagnosis remains unclear, or in which the patient is not responding to treatment."
