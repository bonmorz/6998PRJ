The patient\u2019s symptoms, including difficulty standing up, dizziness, excessive sweating, constipation, and flat affect, suggest a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. This, along with the lack of improvement with levodopa, points towards Shy-Drager syndrome as the most likely diagnosis. Parkinson\u2019s disease would respond to levodopa and is associated with tremors. Progressive supranuclear palsy would have abnormalities in eye movements and posture. Wilson disease usually presents in younger patients and involves liver dysfunction."

Progressive supranuclear palsy can present with early postural instability but typically does not cause autonomic symptoms. Wilson disease typically presents in younger patients with liver and psychiatric symptoms. The symptoms of the patient are consistent with Shy-Drager syndrome, which is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that affects both the central and autonomic nervous systems, causing Parkinson-like symptoms and autonomic dysfunction."

Additionally, the lack of tremors and small writing make Parkinson\u2019s disease less likely. Progressive supranuclear palsy is also a possibility, but the lack of vertical gaze palsy makes it less likely.
