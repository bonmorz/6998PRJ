The patient meets the criteria for major depressive disorder, including depressed mood, loss of interest in pleasurable activities, weight loss, insomnia, suicidal ideation, and psychomotor agitation. While acute grief can have some similar symptoms, such as sadness and decreased appetite, it would not typically include suicidal ideation. Persistent depressive disorder would require symptoms lasting for at least 2 years, which is not the case in this situation. Bipolar II disorder would require a history of at least one episode of hypomania or mania, which is not present in this case."
