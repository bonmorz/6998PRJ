Among the options, only option D is correct as gallstones are most commonly formed due to bile supersaturated with cholesterol. Option A is incorrect as uric acid stones are less common and usually only found in patients with gout. Option B is incorrect as beta-glucuronidase is a risk factor for pigment stones, which are less common than cholesterol stones. Option C is incorrect as the stones in the figure are radiolucent, not radiopaque."

The fact that the patient's symptoms are precipitated by the intake of fatty foods, combined with the ultrasonography findings of multiple stones in the gallbladder, suggests that the most likely cause is gallstones formed due to bile supersaturated with cholesterol. Beta-glucuronidase is involved in the formation of pigment stones, which are not depicted in the image provided. Uric acid stones are not typically found in the gallbladder. Gallstones formed due to bile supersaturated with cholesterol are radiopaque on X-ray imaging."
