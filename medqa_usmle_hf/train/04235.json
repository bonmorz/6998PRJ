It works by inhibiting SGLT2, which leads to increased glucose excretion in the urine. One of the significant side effects of this medication is an increased risk of euglycemic DKA, which can occur even in patients with normal blood glucose levels. Therefore, before initiating the medication, it is crucial to evaluate serum creatinine levels, as canagliflozin is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment.
