The head CT shows a subdural hematoma, which can be caused by the patient's high INR value indicating an over-anticoagulated state. The best option in this case is to treat with Vitamin K to reverse the effects of the anticoagulation. Protamine and platelet transfusion are not effective for treating over-anticoagulation, and fresh frozen plasma may not be necessary unless there is active bleeding."

The patient has an elevated INR, which suggests that he is on or recently stopped taking anticoagulants, increasing his risk of bleeding. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacologic therapy for this patient would be Vitamin K, which helps to reverse the anticoagulant effect. Protamine is used to reverse the effects of heparin, not warfarin. Platelet transfusion is not indicated for an elevated INR. Fresh frozen plasma can also be used to correct coagulopathy, but it has a higher risk for transfusion reactions and is typically reserved for more severe cases or when Vitamin K is contraindicated."

Protamine is used to reverse the effects of heparin, but there is no mention of the patient being on heparin. Platelet transfusion and fresh frozen plasma are not indicated as the patient's main issue is a high INR level, not a low platelet count or clotting factor deficiency."
