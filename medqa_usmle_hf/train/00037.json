A CSF analysis reveals no signs of inflammation, indicating a non-inflammatory process affecting the motor neurons. A throat swab reveals an RNA virus, which likely caused the disease. Among the options, only the destruction of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, where the cell bodies of motor neurons that innervate skeletal muscle are located, would result in flaccid paralysis of muscles. Choice (A) refers to the sensory neurons in the posterior horn, which are not affected in this case. Choice (B) refers to demyelination, which is not a feature of this particular disease. Choice (C) is not a feature of this disease either."
