Option A is incorrect because venous congestion in the reproductive organs during pregnancy is due to the mechanical pressure of the growing fetus, not estrogens. Option B is incorrect because estradiol has the largest blood concentration among the estrogens during pregnancy. Option C is incorrect because blood estrogen levels actually increase during pregnancy, not fall dramatically."
