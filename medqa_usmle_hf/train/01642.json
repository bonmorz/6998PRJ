IV lorazepam is a benzodiazepine used for anxiety and seizures, but is not indicated in this case. IV phenytoin is an anticonvulsant used for seizures, which the patient does not have. IV vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin are broad-spectrum antibiotics used for bacterial infections, which are not indicated in this case."
