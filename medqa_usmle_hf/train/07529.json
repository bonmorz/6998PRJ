Option B, increased PTH with decreased calcium and phosphate, is seen in primary hyperparathyroidism. Option C, increased PTH with increased calcium and phosphate, is seen in renal osteodystrophy.

In patients with chronic kidney disease like this patient, kidneys are unable to activate vitamin D, resulting in decreased calcium absorption from the intestines, leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism. The increased PTH will cause increased bone resorption, which will release calcium and phosphate into the bloodstream. However, the body is unable to utilize the excess phosphate properly, leading to increased phosphate levels in the blood as well. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer."
