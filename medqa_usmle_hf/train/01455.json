These symptoms suggest urinary retention, which may be caused by an obstruction by the palpable mass. Transurethral catheterization should be performed to alleviate the urinary retention and further management should depend on the cause of the mass found in the pelvic ultrasound. Observation and NSAIDs administration may not address the underlying cause of the symptoms. Finasteride administration is not indicated for this patient's presentation. IV pyelography is not the most appropriate next step in management."

The palpable lower midline abdominal mass and hypoactive bowel sounds suggest acute urinary retention due to bladder outlet obstruction.

Observation and NSAIDs administration are not appropriate for this condition. Finasteride is not effective in acute urinary retention.
