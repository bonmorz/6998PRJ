The patient has a history of consuming alcohol daily for 10 years, but the laboratory studies show negative results for hepatitis B and C. Liver biopsy shows excessive intracellular fat accumulation, hepatocyte ballooning, and perivenular infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils without significant fibrosis, which are indicative of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Alcoholic hepatitis can also have similar symptoms, but the negative results for hepatitis B and C and the patient's history of diabetes and obesity suggest NASH as the likely diagnosis."
