The patient presents with symptoms of facial droop and inability to fully close her left eye, suggesting peripheral facial nerve palsy. The fact that she is on oral contraceptives and smokes half a pack of cigarettes per day puts her at an increased risk for developing Bell's palsy. Prednisone alone is the most appropriate intervention for Bell's palsy. Head CT without contrast is not indicated unless there are additional neurological findings. Implantation of gold weight for eyelid and intravenous immunoglobulin are not indicated for Bell's palsy."

In this case, the most likely cause is the use of oral contraceptives, smoking, and escitalopram. Prednisone alone is the best intervention to address the inflammation of the facial nerve. Head CT without contrast is not necessary as the symptoms suggest a diagnosis of Bell's palsy. Implantation of gold weight for eyelid and intravenous immunoglobulin are not appropriate treatments for Bell's palsy."

Oral contraceptives and smoking are risk factors for thrombotic events, but atherosclerotic infarct is unlikely given the generalized, unilateral left-sided drooping of the upper and lower face. Since this is a case of Bell\u2019s palsy, Prednisone alone is the best option to address the most likely cause of the symptoms. Head CT without contrast is not necessary and implantation of gold weight for the eyelid and intravenous immunoglobulin are not proven interventions for Bell\u2019s palsy."

The symptoms, especially the unilateral left-sided drooping of the face, suggest that the most likely cause is Bell's palsy. Prednisone alone is the most appropriate intervention for Bell's Palsy, as it helps reduce inflammation and swelling around the facial nerve, which is believed to be responsible for the palsy. Head CT without contrast is not necessary for Bell's palsy as it is not caused by a stroke or other structural problems. Implantation of gold weight for the eyelid or intravenous immunoglobulin are not appropriate interventions for Bell's palsy either."
