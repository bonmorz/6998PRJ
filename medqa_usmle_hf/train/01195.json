These findings suggest bacterial pneumonia as the most likely diagnosis. Sarcoidosis typically presents with nonproductive cough and pulmonary infiltrates that are bilateral and symmetric. Lung cancer typically presents with cough, weight loss, and hemoptysis. Tuberculosis may present with cough, fever, and night sweats, but typically shows cavitary lesions on chest X-ray."

Sarcoidosis usually presents with asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, while lung cancer would not typically present with productive cough and purulent sputum. Tuberculosis may present with similar symptoms, but the chest X-ray findings are usually different, and the patient's previous diagnosis of influenza and lack of adherence to treatment make pneumonia more likely."
