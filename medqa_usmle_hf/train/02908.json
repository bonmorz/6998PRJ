Based on the clinical presentation and ultrasonography findings, the most likely diagnosis is developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Treatment for DDH in infants under 6 months of age is typically done using a Pavlik harness. Therefore, option D is the most appropriate next step in management. Options A and B are not necessary for the management of DDH in infants. Option C is not appropriate as DDH requires prompt treatment to prevent long-term complications."

MRI and X-ray may be useful for further evaluation, but the initial treatment should be non-invasive and conservative. Reassurance and follow-up in 4 weeks is not recommended as DDH requires early treatment to achieve optimal results."
