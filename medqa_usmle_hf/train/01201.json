The patient has hypokalemia, which can cause muscle weakness and increased urinary frequency, and is likely due to the use of diuretics for nephrolithiasis. The low potassium level is the most emergent issue and should be corrected first. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate can help shift potassium back into the cells and raise the serum potassium level. Administering insulin or increasing the methotrexate dose may worsen the hypokalemia, and potassium replacement therapy with dextrose alone is not enough to correct the hypokalemia."
