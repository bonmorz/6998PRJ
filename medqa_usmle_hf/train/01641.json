The patient\u2019s clinical presentation is consistent with sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Cryoprecipitate, FFP and low dose SC heparin is the most appropriate management for DIC, as it helps replace clotting factors and reduce clotting risk. Prednisone therapy is not indicated for this condition. Urgent plasma exchange may be indicated in some cases of DIC, but is not typically the first line of treatment. Splenectomy is not indicated in this scenario."

The positive blood and urine cultures for Escherichia coli suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a common complication in sepsis. The treatment of DIC includes volume resuscitation, antibiotics to control the infection, and blood component therapy. Cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and low dose subcutaneous (SC) heparin are used to replenish clotting factors and control bleeding. Prednisone therapy is not indicated in DIC. Plasma exchange is used in some cases of severe DIC, but it is not the initial treatment of choice. Splenectomy is not indicated in DIC."
