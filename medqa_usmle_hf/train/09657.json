Sick cell disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene, leading to abnormal hemoglobin production and morphological changes in erythrocytes. Increased red blood cell sensitivity to complement activation is a characteristic of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which is not relevant to this case. Sickle cell disease is not an X-linked recessive disease or secondary to infections or autoimmune diseases."
