The symptoms and findings suggest Takayasu arteritis, which is a type of large vessel vasculitis that affects the aorta and its branches.

Fibrinoid necrosis is a finding seen in polyarteritis nodosa, while subendothelial immune complex deposition is seen in lupus vasculitis. Calcification of the media may be seen in atherosclerosis, but is not specific to Takayasu arteritis."
