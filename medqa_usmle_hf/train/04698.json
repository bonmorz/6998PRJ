The symptoms suggest urinary retention, and the history of prostate enlargement and catheterization make it even more likely. Benign prostatic enlargement is a common condition in older men and can cause lower urinary tract symptoms, including retention. Adverse effects of pilocarpine are typically related to sweating, salivation, and tearing. Urethral stricture can also cause urinary retention but is less likely given the patient's history. There is no information suggesting prostate cancer."

Adverse effects of pilocarpine are unlikely to cause these symptoms so soon after administration. Urethral stricture is also unlikely to develop so acutely.
