The medication that requires a specific thymidine kinase for activation is acyclovir, which is used to treat herpes simplex virus. Renal failure is a known adverse effect of acyclovir, as the drug can crystallize in the renal tubules and cause acute tubular necrosis. Gingival hyperplasia is a side effect of some antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin. Pulmonary fibrosis is a side effect of certain chemotherapy drugs, such as bleomycin. Photosensitivity is a side effect of some antibiotics, such as tetracyclines."
