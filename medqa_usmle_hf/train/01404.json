The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease, which puts him at high risk for cardiovascular disease. His triglycerides are also elevated, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Therefore, starting statin therapy is recommended to lower the patient's cholesterol levels and reduce his risk of cardiovascular events. Increasing lisinopril dose is not necessary as his blood pressure is already controlled. Increasing metformin dose is not necessary as his blood glucose level is well-controlled. Discontinuing metoprolol and starting propranolol is not recommended as beta-blockers such as metoprolol are commonly used in patients with cardiovascular disease."
