The symptoms of leg cramping, runny nose, chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain, irritability, and yawning suggest opioid withdrawal, most likely heroin. Cool, damp skin with piloerection, hyperactive bowel sounds, and 3+ deep tendon reflexes are also indicative of opioid withdrawal. Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid withdrawal may present with hallucinations and seizures, but not with the symptoms described in the question. Barbiturate withdrawal may present with seizures and confusion, but not with the symptoms described in the question. Cocaine withdrawal may result in depression and fatigue, but not with the symptoms described in the question."
