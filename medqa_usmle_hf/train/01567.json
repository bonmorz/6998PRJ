The patient\u2019s symptoms and history of being in Nigeria suggest the most likely cause is granulomatous inflammation, possibly due to exposure to tuberculosis or sarcoidosis. Elevated serum calcium concentration is also consistent with sarcoidosis. Neoplastic transformation would show different symptoms and features on x-ray, such as focal lesions. Viral infection would not cause these specific x-ray findings. Air trapping would be seen in conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but the patient\u2019s symptoms and x-ray findings suggest a different diagnosis."

The patient's history of travel to Nigeria suggests exposure to infectious agents that can cause granulomatous inflammation, such as tuberculosis or histoplasmosis. The nontender axillary lymph nodes, elevated serum calcium, and chest x-ray findings of enlarged hilar lymph nodes and reticular opacities in both lungs are consistent with granulomatous inflammation. Neoplastic transformation and air trapping would not likely present with these findings. Viral infection may cause respiratory symptoms but would not explain the other findings."

The patient has a dry cough, decreased exercise tolerance, and ankle pain, which suggest sarcoidosis, a type of granulomatous inflammation. The bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and reticular opacities in both lungs further support this diagnosis. The nontender axillary lymph nodes could also be a manifestation of sarcoidosis. The elevated serum calcium level is likely due to hypercalciuria, which is common in sarcoidosis. Neoplastic transformation is less likely given the patient's history and presentation. Viral infection would not account for the prolonged and progressive symptoms. Air trapping is a finding seen in obstructive lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which are not supported by the patient's clinical and radiological findings."
