Vascular dementia is associated with cerebrovascular disease, which has not been mentioned in the patient\u2019s medical history. Normal pressure hydrocephalus presents with gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia, but does not usually include Parkinsonism or hallucinations. Frontotemporal dementia presents with personality changes and behavioral symptoms, which are not prominent in this case."

Vascular dementia is often caused by multiple small strokes and presents with memory loss, confusion, and gait disturbance. Normal pressure hydrocephalus typically presents with urinary incontinence, gait disturbance, and cognitive decline. Frontotemporal dementia presents with changes in behavior and personality."
