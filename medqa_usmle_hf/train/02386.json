Lowering GFR while raising filtration fraction indicates vasoconstriction of both afferent and efferent arterioles, which will result in decreased blood flow to the glomerulus and decreased GFR. Therefore, the answer is (B). Option (A) would increase blood flow and GFR, while option (C) would increase pressure in glomerulus and increase GFR. Option (D) does not describe an effect on arterioles."

The drug is designed to lower GFR and raise filtration fraction, which means that it would decrease the amount of blood filtered by the kidneys while increasing the proportion of that blood that is actually being filtered. This would require a decrease in both afferent and efferent arteriole diameters, which would result in increased resistance to blood flow and a smaller volume of blood being filtered through the glomerulus. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. Options (A) and (C) imply opposite effects on the two arterioles and would not result in the desired outcome. Option (D) is not relevant to the question."

A decrease in GFR and increase in filtration fraction suggests that both arterioles need to be constricted to maintain a balance. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) afferent arteriole constriction and efferent arteriole constriction. Option (A) is incorrect as efferent arteriole vasodilation would increase GFR, which is the opposite effect desired in the drug trial. Option (C) is incorrect as afferent arteriole dilation would increase GFR, again opposite to the intended effect of the drug. Option (D) is also incorrect as it does not address the question of arteriole constriction or dilation."

Afferent arteriole constriction and efferent arteriole constriction will achieve this effect.
