The patient\u2019s history of heart transplantation suggests that the most likely cause of his current symptoms is obliterative arteriopathy, a common complication following transplantation due to chronic immune system aggression against transplanted vessels. The coronary angiogram revealing diffuse concentric narrowing of all branches of the left coronary artery is indicative of this. Vasospasm of distal coronary arteries branches usually produce focal areas of ischemia, not diffuse narrowing. Left ventricular hypertrophy is a common finding in patients with hypertension, but blood pressure in this patient is normal.
