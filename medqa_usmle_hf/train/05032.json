If left untreated, testicular atrophy can occur and inhibin secretion by Sertoli cells can decrease. Inhibin can help regulate FSH secretion, leading to a deficiency of inhibin by puberty if the condition is not treated. Testosterone production may also be affected, but the primary hormone affected by this condition is inhibin. Therefore, the answer is (B) inhibin."

In this case, the testis remains in the abdomen and secretes inhibin, which causes negative feedback on FSH production by the anterior pituitary gland. If left untreated, there may be deficiency in inhibin secretion, resulting in increased FSH levels and decreased testosterone production by puberty. Therefore, inhibin is the hormone that would likely be deficient in this patient by puberty if the condition is left untreated."

The symptoms described in the question indicate that the infant has cryptorchidism, which can cause the testes to be undescended. Inhibin is a hormone that is produced by the Sertoli cells of the testes and regulates the secretion of FSH. If left untreated, cryptorchidism can lead to a deficiency of Inhibin, which can ultimately result in impaired spermatogenesis and testosterone production.
