The location of the intrasellar mass suggests that it is a pituitary adenoma, which can cause compression of surrounding structures such as the optic chiasm and cause double vision and impaired peripheral vision. Impotence is one of the potential consequences of decreased gonadotropin secretion by the pituitary gland. Macroglossia is a symptom of acromegaly, which is caused by excess secretion of growth hormone by the pituitary gland, but it is not typically associated with intrasellar masses. Galactorrhea is a symptom of prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas, but a mass of this size is unlikely to be a prolactinoma. Polyuria is not typically associated with pituitary adenomas."
