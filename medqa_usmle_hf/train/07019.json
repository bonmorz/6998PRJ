Ondansetron is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, meaning it blocks serotonin receptors on the vagal and spinal afferent nerves from the intestines, which can help relieve nausea and vomiting. Option A is incorrect because inhibition of gastroesophageal motility would not relieve nausea and vomiting. Option B is also incorrect as it refers to dopamine receptors, which are not targeted by ondansetron. Option C stimulates intestinal and colonic motility, which can actually exacerbate nausea and vomiting."
