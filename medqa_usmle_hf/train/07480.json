Option B suggests tapering fluoxetine and switching to a different medication, which is not contraindicated but may not be the best option due to the risk of relapse. Option D suggesting adding phenelzine, which is an MAOI, is contraindicated due to the potential for interactions with other medications and foods that can cause hypertensive crisis. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
