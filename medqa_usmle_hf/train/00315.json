The hyperpigmented rash around the base of the neck suggests cutaneous flushing, which is characteristic of carcinoid syndrome. The echocardiography findings suggest left-sided fibrosis and valve dysfunction, which is also consistent with carcinoid syndrome. Increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration in the urine supports the diagnosis. Tumors in the pancreas, appendix, or descending colon are also associated with carcinoid syndrome, but lung tumors are the most common cause. Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to show a tumor in the lung without metastasis."
