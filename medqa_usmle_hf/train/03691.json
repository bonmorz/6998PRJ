This mutation is associated with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, which increases the risk of developing clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, the correct answer is (A). Retinoblastoma is associated with mutations in the RB1 gene, osteosarcoma is associated with mutations in the TP53 gene, and breast cancer is associated with mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes."
