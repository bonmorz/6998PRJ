Antibiotic therapy is required to treat the infection, and the mechanism of action of the antibiotic must target the bacterial cell wall in order to be effective. Therefore, the appropriate antibiotic would be a cell wall synthesis inhibitor such as azithromycin or doxycycline, in combination with ceftriaxone or another third-generation cephalosporin. DNA, folic acid, and RNA synthesis inhibitors are used for different types of infections and are not indicated for the treatment of PID caused by a bacterial infection."
