Sickle cell disease increases the risk of infection, particularly with encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Therefore, it is recommended for patients with sickle cell disease to receive vaccination against these bacteria, including meningococcal, pneumococcal, and Haemophilus influenzae vaccines. In particular, the patient should receive serogroup B meningococcal vaccination at the age of 10 years, as they are at higher risk of this type of infection. Option (A), that these vaccines are likely to cause complications or elicit disease, is incorrect. Option (C), that the patient should receive serogroup D meningococcal vaccination, is incorrect as the most common serogroups of meningococcal infections in the US are B, C, and Y. Option (D), that his condition does not affect his chances to get any infection and thus does not require additional vaccinations, is also incorrect as patients with sickle cell disease are at an increased risk of infection."

Option C is incorrect because serogroup B vaccine is recommended, not serogroup D. Option D is incorrect because sickle cell anemia does increase a patient's risk for infections."

Option A is incorrect because the vaccines mentioned are actually recommended for patients with sickle cell disease due to their increased risk of infection. Option C is incorrect because there is no mention of the patient\u2019s risk for serogroup B meningococcal infection specifically.

Vaccination guidelines for sickle cell disease patients recommend receiving meningococcal vaccination at the age of 10 years, followed by boosters every 5 years if high risk remains. This recommendation includes serogroup B meningococcal vaccination. Thus, the correct answer is (B). Option (A) is incorrect as the patient should receive pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae vaccines. Option (C) is incorrect as serogroup D meningococcal vaccination is not recommended for sickle cell disease patients. Option (D) is incorrect as sickle cell disease patients are at higher risk for infections and additional vaccinations are advised."
