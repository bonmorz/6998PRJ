Hypothalamic dysfunction and surreptitious laxative use are unlikely to be the cause of this young girl's symptoms. Shiga toxin production from Shigella can cause a similar syndrome, but exposure to Shigella is less likely given the diarrhea occurring after the family barbecue."

The abdominal pain, decreased urination, and low platelet count with normal PT and PTT suggests thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS is often caused by E. coli infection, specifically strains that produce Shiga-like toxin, which can also cause diarrhea like the one described in the patient's history. Therefore, the most likely etiology of the girl's urinary symptoms is Shiga-like toxin production from EHEC. Options A and B are unlikely causes, and option C is incorrect because Shigella is not associated with HUS."
