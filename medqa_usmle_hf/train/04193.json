The symptoms including a limp favoring one leg, mild tenderness in one area, and decreased range of motion suggest Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, which is a childhood condition that affects the hip. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis usually presents with sudden hip or knee pain after trauma. Developmental dysplasia of the hip is either present at birth or develops within the first year of life. Viral-induced synovitis does not explain the decreased range of motion."
