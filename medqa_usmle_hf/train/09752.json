Decrescendo diastolic murmur and muffled heart sounds suggest valvular disease or pericardial effusion, which are not supported by the patient's history or physical examination.

Atrial gallop can be heard in some cases of heart failure, which can be a complication of myocardial infarction. Decrescendo diastolic murmur and muffled heart sounds may suggest aortic regurgitation and pericardial effusion, respectively, but these findings are less likely given the patient's presentation. Ventricular gallop may indicate left ventricular dysfunction, but this is less likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms."
