The symptoms and physical examination findings suggest gout, which is caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints. Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that can reduce inflammation and pain associated with gout. Probenecid is used for chronic gout to increase the excretion of uric acid into the urine. Oral methylprednisolone and meloxicam are also used for acute gout but are less effective than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Colchicine and celecoxib can also be used for acute gout, but diclofenac is the most appropriate initial treatment option."

Probenecid is used for chronic gout management, while colchicine is commonly used for acute gout treatment, but is not the best option for this patient due to his hypertension. Oral methylprednisolone may also be used as an alternative to NSAIDs, but is not listed as an option in the answer choices. The combination of colchicine and celecoxib may increase the risk of cardiovascular events and is not recommended in patients with cardiovascular disease."
