The droopy eyelid and persistent constriction of the right pupil, along with the cracked and dry skin on the right half of his face, suggest the presence of Horner's syndrome. The most common cause of Horner's syndrome in adults is a Pancoast tumor, which is a type of lung cancer that develops in the upper part of the lung and can invade neighboring structures like the nerve fibers that travel through the chest. Drug use, facial nerve damage, and syphilis are not commonly associated with Horner's syndrome."
