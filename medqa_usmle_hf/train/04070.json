The pattern of pain and stiffness in the hands that is worse in the morning and gradually improves throughout the morning is indicative of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the body produces antibodies against antibodies, leading to inflammation and damage in the joints. Repetitive microtrauma can lead to overuse injuries, while production of antibodies against smooth muscle is more commonly seen in autoimmune hepatitis. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody production is associated with vasculitis."
