Fluoxetine is an antidepressant and not indicated for the patient\u2019s acute symptoms. Thiamine is indicated for alcohol intoxication and potential Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, but the patient\u2019s neurological exam is currently normal. Rest and primary care follow up is the best next step at this time, as the patient\u2019s symptoms may resolve with time and monitoring. However, if symptoms persist or worsen, further diagnostic testing may be needed."

The patient has persistent symptoms after a head injury with a normal CT scan, indicating possible mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Management for mTBI includes rest and gradual return to activities as tolerated. Option A is not recommended as imaging is not necessary for mild symptoms and may lead to unnecessary radiation exposure. Option B may be appropriate for depression but not for mTBI. Option D is used for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient\u2019s symptoms.
