The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest either renal cell carcinoma or autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). However, the presence of multiple bilateral kidney cysts and hepatic cysts is more indicative of ADPKD. Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome can also cause kidney and liver cysts, but also has additional symptoms like tumors in the retina and central nervous system. Simple kidney cysts usually do not cause the other symptoms described."

The symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a possibility of Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is characterized by the development and growth of multiple cysts in the kidneys and other organs.  ADPKD can cause gross or microscopic hematuria, abdominal discomfort or pain, hypertension, or an enlarging abdomen, which matches this patient's symptoms. The presence of hepatic cysts and a positive family history also support this diagnosis. Renal cell carcinoma and Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome usually present with unilateral renal mass, while simple kidney cysts are usually asymptomatic and do not cause brownish discoloration of urine."
