The symptoms, especially the scratching sound on the left sternal border, and the timing after myocardial infarction suggest Dressler's syndrome, which is a type of post-myocardial infarction syndrome characterized by pericarditis, pleuritis, and/or pneumonitis. The widespread ST elevations on ECG also support this diagnosis. Aortic dissection and ventricular aneurysm would typically present earlier after the myocardial infarction, and myocarditis may be a possible cause but is less likely given the patient's history."

ECG findings are consistent with Dressler's syndrome. Myocarditis typically presents with fever, myalgia, and other symptoms of infection. Ventricular aneurysm can cause chest pain and ECG abnormalities, but is less likely given the recent myocardial infarction.
