The fact that radiolabeled carbon dioxide is detected when radiolabeled methylmalonic acid is added but not when radiolabeled propionate is added suggests a defect in the propionyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme.

Therefore, only phenylalanine can be fully metabolized by this patient."

The inability to convert propionate to succinyl-CoA suggests a defect in the propionate pathway, which is necessary for metabolism of isoleucine, valine, methionine, and threonine. The fact that radiolabeled carbon dioxide is detected when radiolabeled methylmalonic acid is added suggests a normal pathway for the breakdown of propionyl-CoA to succinate. This points to a defect in the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, which is necessary for the metabolism of propionate and therefore threonine and isoleucine. Phenylalanine can be metabolized via the phenylalanine pathway, which is not affected by the defect in propionate metabolism. Therefore, the patient can fully metabolize phenylalanine."
