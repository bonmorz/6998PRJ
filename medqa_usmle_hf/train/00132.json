The patient has several symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis, including fever, cough, weight loss, and bilateral adrenal enlargement with low levels of cortisol and high levels of ACTH. This is known as Addison disease, caused by destruction of the adrenal glands by an autoimmune process, infection, or hemorrhage. Among the given options, infection with acid-fast bacilli is the most likely cause of Addison disease in this patient, given her recent immigration from the Philippines and her symptoms. Pituitary tumor and autoimmune adrenalitis are less likely causes, and adrenal hemorrhage is not supported by the clinical picture."
