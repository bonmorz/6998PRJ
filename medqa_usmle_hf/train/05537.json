The patient is likely suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is often accompanied by abnormal hair growth and weight issues, as well as other symptoms such as hirsutism and acanthosis nigricans. The hormonal oral contraceptive is used to regulate menstrual cycles and treat symptoms of PCOS. Among the options, only thickening of cervical mucus is a property of endometrial protective hormones, which helps prevent sperm from reaching the ovum. The other options are properties of other types of hormonal contraceptives."

Hormonal contraceptives that contain estrogen and progesterone work by preventing ovulation and altering cervical mucus viscosity to prevent sperm from entering the uterus.

Progestin, found in this oral contraceptive, thickens cervical mucus, making it more difficult for sperm to reach the egg for fertilization. Option A is incorrect as this property is associated with estrogen. Option C is incorrect as hormonal contraceptives may increase LDL. Option D is incorrect as hormonal contraceptives are known to increase bone mineral density and decrease the risk of fractures."

Option A is incorrect because the hormone found in oral contraceptives does not affect thyroid binding globulin levels. Option C is incorrect because the hormone found in oral contraceptives may increase LDL levels. Option D is incorrect because the hormone found in oral contraceptives actually increases bone density and decreases the risk of fractures."

One of the properties of hormonal oral contraceptives is thickening of cervical mucus, which helps prevent sperm from reaching the egg. Answer choice A is incorrect because hormonal oral contraceptives can increase thyroid binding globulin. Answer choice C is incorrect because while hormonal oral contraceptives can decrease LDL cholesterol, it is not a property of the endometrial protective hormone specifically found in this contraceptive. Answer choice D is incorrect because hormonal oral contraceptives are actually associated with a reduced risk of bone fractures."
