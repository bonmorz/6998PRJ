Chest X-ray is a more appropriate next step in management as sarcoidosis, a granulomatous disorder, is a common cause of erythema nodosum and can be identified on chest X-ray."

The elevated ESR supports this suspicion. Chest X-ray is the most appropriate next step in management to evaluate for sarcoidosis, which can present with erythema nodosum and other possible manifestations. Oral amoxicillin is unlikely to be helpful for this presentation. Isoniazid is used to treat tuberculosis, which is not suggested by the presentation.

The presentation of painful red nodules on the shins associated with malaise and joint pains are classic signs of erythema nodosum, which is a common manifestation of several systemic diseases including sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and Streptococcus infection. However, since the ASO titers are within the reference range, a Streptococcus infection is less likely. X-ray of the chest can help identify sarcoidosis as a possible underlying cause, and therefore it is the most appropriate next step in management. Oral amoxicillin is not indicated as the ASO titers were within the reference range. Oral isoniazid and stool culture are irrelevant in this context."
