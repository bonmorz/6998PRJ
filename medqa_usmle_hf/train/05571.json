This is caused by failure of cleavage of the forebrain during embryonic development, which occurs during the 3rd to 5th weeks of gestation. This failure can be caused by maternal alcohol consumption, as seen in this case. Closure of the rostral neuropore is completed by the end of the 4th week of gestation, and failure of this process can cause anencephaly. Formation of the 1st branchial arch is essential for craniofacial development but does not affect forebrain cleavage. Development of the metencephalon is important for cerebellar and brainstem function but does not affect craniofacial development."
