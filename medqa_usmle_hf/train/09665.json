Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, stress urinary incontinence is the most likely diagnosis.

Cystoscopy may be considered if other causes of urinary incontinence need to be ruled out, and transvaginal ultrasound may be indicated in cases of pelvic organ prolapse. Post-void residual volume may be helpful in cases of overflow incontinence but is not indicated in this scenario."
