The muscles involved in urinary continence receive efferent innervation from the S3-S4 nerve roots, making option (D) the correct answer. Option (A) refers to the nerve roots responsible for motor and sensory function in the lower limbs, while option (B) refers to autonomic nerve fibers. Option (C) refers to the nerve responsible for the motor innervation of the adductor muscles of the thigh."
