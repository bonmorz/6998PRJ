The elevated lactate and alanine levels along with the hypotonia suggest an inherited metabolic disorder such as Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD). MSUD is caused by a deficiency in branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) enzyme, which is necessary for the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids including leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Therefore, increasing leucine and decreasing isoleucine and valine in the patient\u2019s diet is necessary to manage this condition."
