The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a condition called 5-\u03b1 reductase deficiency, which results in ambiguous genitalia and lack of female internal reproductive organs. This is because the enzyme responsible for converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone is deficient. Sex chromosome monosomy, complete androgen insensitivity, and aromatase deficiency can also cause similar symptoms but the presence of inguinal testes rules out complete androgen insensitivity and aromatase deficiency, while the lack of breast tissue rules out sex chromosome monosomy."

The presence of facial hair, pubic hair extending to the inner surface of both thighs, and inguinal testes suggests 5-\u03b1 reductase deficiency, which is a form of intersex condition where individuals with male chromosomes have primarily female external genitalia but without a uterus or ovaries. Complete androgen insensitivity (A) would show female external genitalia without hair growth, and Sex chromosome monosomy (B) would result in a female phenotype with underdeveloped ovaries. Aromatase deficiency (C) is extremely rare and would result in a failure of estrogen synthesis and masculinization of both sexes."

The presence of facial hair, clitoromegaly, and pubic hair extending to the inner surface of the thighs suggests excess androgen production, and the absence of glandular breast tissue and uterus suggests a lack of estrogen. Among the options, only 5-\u03b1 reductase deficiency can cause these symptoms. This disorder results in a decreased conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is necessary for the formation of external male genitalia. In these individuals, DHT production is decreased, resulting in ambiguous genitalia with a female-appearing phenotype at birth. However, during puberty, increasing levels of testosterone are converted to DHT, resulting in virilization."
