The symptoms and laboratory studies suggest that the most likely cause is Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency (HGPRT deficiency), also known as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This is a genetic disorder that affects muscle tone and behavior, causing developmental delay and self-injurious behavior. The laboratory result of high uric acid levels is also consistent with this diagnosis. FMR1 gene mutation causes Fragile X syndrome, which presents with intellectual disability, large ears, and prominent forehead. Branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex deficiency causes maple syrup urine disease and presents with neurological symptoms, such as seizures and coma, along with a distinctive sweet odor in urine. Microdeletion of paternal chromosome 15 causes Prader-Willi syndrome, which presents with developmental delay, hypotonia, and hyperphagia."
