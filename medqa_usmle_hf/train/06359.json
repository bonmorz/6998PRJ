The patient\u2019s history, especially running out of furosemide and lisinopril, suggests exacerbation of congestive heart failure. The medications ordered are appropriate for such exacerbation. However, before starting the medication regimen, it is important to check the patient\u2019s basic metabolic panel to evaluate her electrolyte status since diuretics like furosemide may cause electrolyte disturbances. The other options may also be useful in evaluating the patient\u2019s condition but are less relevant for assessing the safety of medication use at this time."

Chest x-ray can support the diagnosis of ADHF but is not required before starting treatment. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels can also support the diagnosis, but the diagnosis is already likely based on the patient's presentation. Urinalysis is not necessary for the initial management of ADHF."
