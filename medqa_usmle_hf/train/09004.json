It is commonly known as an S4 gallop, and is caused by the atria contracting forcefully to overcome resistance from a stiff ventricle. Increased left ventricular compliance would result in an S3 gallop, and increased left ventricular filling volume or increased pulmonary compliance would not cause an extra heart sound. The patient's medical history of a previous myocardial infarction also suggests a potential for decreased left ventricular compliance."
