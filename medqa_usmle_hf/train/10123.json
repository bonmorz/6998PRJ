However, based on medical knowledge, the skin presentation described in this question is suggestive of eczema or atopic dermatitis, which is often associated with allergies, including food allergies. Wheezing is a common symptom of asthma and can be triggered by allergic reactions, so the most likely predisposition in this patient would be to develop wheezing or asthma."
