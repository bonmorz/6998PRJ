Increased potassium levels can cause a decrease in resting membrane potential of skeletal muscle cells, leading to weakness and depressed deep tendon reflexes. Peaked T-waves on ECG are also indicative of hyperkalemia. Dysfunction of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex is associated with muscular dystrophy, which is not consistent with the patient\u2019s history. Hyperpolarization of skeletal muscle cells and prolonged release of Ca2+ ions are not directly associated with hyperkalemia."
