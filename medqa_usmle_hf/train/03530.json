Glucagon stimulates lipolysis in adipose tissues, which leads to the breakdown of stored fat molecules into free fatty acids to be used for energy. This is likely the effect that the bodybuilder is trying to exploit for weight loss. Glucagon also increases hepatic gluconeogenesis, but this would not lead to weight loss. Increased glucose utilization by tissues would also not lead to weight loss, and there is no evidence to support the idea that glucagon decreases blood cholesterol levels."

Glucagon is a hormone produced by the pancreas that stimulates the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in the liver, leading to increased blood glucose levels. However, in this scenario, the man is trying to exploit the effects of glucagon on fat metabolism. Glucagon stimulates lipolysis, which is the breakdown of fats into fatty acids and glycerol, leading to increased fat burning and weight loss. Therefore, the correct answer is (D)."
