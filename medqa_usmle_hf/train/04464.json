The patient has thrombocytopenia, which suggests decreased platelets, but bleeding time is normal, which suggests normal platelet function. This indicates that the thrombocytopenia is not caused by decreased platelet aggregation or immune production of anti-platelet antibodies. Increased serum von Willebrand factor multimers, on the other hand, can cause increased platelet destruction and lead to thrombocytopenia. Therefore, (C) is the correct answer. Large platelets on peripheral blood smear are seen in Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which is a rare cause of thrombocytopenia and not likely for this patient."

Large platelets are seen in conditions such as Bernard-Soulier syndrome, but this is less likely in this case with no other suggestive features. Decreased platelet aggregation on peripheral blood smear is not specific to any condition, and is not a likely finding in this case."
