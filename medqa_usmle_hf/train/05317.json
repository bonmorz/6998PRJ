The next best step in the diagnostic evaluation of this patient is to perform a thin-section computed tomography (CT) through the nodule. This will help to evaluate the size and shape of the nodule in greater detail and determine if it has any concerning features, such as irregular borders, spicules, or calcifications. Further management will depend on the results of the CT scan. PET scan may be used to evaluate the metabolic activity of the nodule but is not the first-line investigation. CT-guided transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) or transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) may be necessary if the nodule is suspicious for malignancy on CT scan, but these procedures are not indicated as the first step in diagnostic evaluation."
