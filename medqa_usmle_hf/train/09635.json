The patient has signs of spinal cord injury, and the most appropriate next step in management would be to place a Foley catheter to assess for urinary retention and prevent bladder distension. Intravenous dexamethasone therapy would be appropriate in cases of acute spinal cord injury with inflammation, but the patient\u2019s recent trauma suggests that the injury is traumatic rather than inflammatory. A cervical x-ray could potentially identify any cervical spine injury, but the patient\u2019s signs and symptoms suggest spinal cord injury, which may not be visible on x-ray. MRI of the spine is also useful in identifying spinal cord injury, but is not the most urgent next step in management."

Intravenous dexamethasone therapy is not indicated for spinal cord injury. Cervical x-ray may be performed to assess for fractures or dislocations, but it is not urgent in this case.

The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with spinal cord injury, which requires neuroprotective measures such as maintaining adequate spinal cord perfusion by avoiding hypotension and hypoxia. Placement of a Foley catheter is necessary to monitor urinary retention, which is common after spinal cord injury. Intravenous dexamethasone is not recommended in patients with acute spinal cord injury because of its potential adverse effects on the injured spinal cord. Cervical x-ray and MRI of the spine can be useful in evaluating for vertebral fractures and spinal cord abnormalities, respectively, but they are not the most appropriate next step in management."
