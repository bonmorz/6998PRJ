The question mentions that the drug acts as an agonist at multiple adrenergic receptors, so it can affect more than one type of receptor. However, the fact that it produces urinary retention suggests that it is acting on \u03b11 receptors, which are primarily responsible for smooth muscle contraction. The signal transduction mechanism for \u03b11 receptors involves the Gq protein, so the correct answer is (D)."
