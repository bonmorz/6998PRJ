With the patient being unstable for imaging, the history becomes even more important. Among the options, only Use of oral contraceptives (OCPs) is a risk factor for developing a hepatic adenoma. Hepatic adenoma can present with acute abdominal pain, hypotension, and acute blood loss anemia due to rupture or bleed."

The CT scan shows a large right hepatic lobe and a hypodense area indicating necrosis, which is consistent with ischemic hepatitis or hepatic infarction. Use of oral contraceptives for birth control is a risk factor for hepatic infarction, along with other causes such as hypercoagulable states and vascular diseases. A history of smoking is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but not specifically for hepatic infarction. Symptoms after a fatty meal could suggest gallbladder or pancreatic issues, but not specifically hepatic infarction. A history of Epstein-Barr virus and rugby participation are not relevant to hepatic infarction."

A 15 pack/year smoking history is associated with an increased risk of gallbladder disease but is not specific to this case. Symptoms after a fatty meal can be seen in cholecystitis, but it is not specific enough to conclusively support the diagnosis.
