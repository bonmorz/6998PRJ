The patient has a history of DVT in the left calf and now presents with swelling and erythema in the left arm, which suggests upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT). The most common cause of UEDVT is thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), which may be due to malignancy. Thus, CT scan of the abdomen would be the most appropriate next step to confirm or rule out a malignancy that may be causing TOS. X-ray of the chest would be useful if there were clinical suspicion for lung cancer or pulmonary embolism. Serum antiphospholipid antibody level testing may be useful if there were clinical suspicion for antiphospholipid syndrome. Serum D-dimer level testing may be useful for ruling out a DVT, but it cannot confirm an underlying diagnosis of UEDVT."

The patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis and presents with symptoms suggestive of superficial thrombophlebitis.

CT scan of the abdomen is the most appropriate next step to confirm the underlying diagnosis. X-ray of the chest is unlikely to reveal any pertinent findings in this case. Serum antiphospholipid antibody level is helpful in diagnosing antiphospholipid syndrome, which can cause thrombosis. Serum D-dimer level is sensitive but not specific for thrombosis, and a positive result would require further diagnostic testing."
