The patient is presenting with symptoms of acute pancreatitis, which is supported by the elevation of lipase levels in the laboratory studies. However, the best prognostic indicator for this condition is hematocrit. A high hematocrit indicates hemoconcentration, which is a marker of systemic inflammation and can predict the severity of pancreatitis. Lipase levels can correlate with the severity of the disease, but hematocrit is a better prognostic indicator. Alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels are not typically elevated in acute pancreatitis."
