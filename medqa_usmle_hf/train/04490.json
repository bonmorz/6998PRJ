Chest X-ray, EKG and CT pulmonary angiography may be useful for ruling out other conditions, but are unlikely to establish a diagnosis of infective endocarditis."

The finding in Figure A suggests infective endocarditis (IE), a serious and potentially life-threatening bacterial infection of the heart. The most helpful test to establish the diagnosis is echocardiography, which can detect the presence of vegetations or abscesses on the heart valves or other structures. Chest X-ray and CT pulmonary angiography may be useful in ruling out other conditions that can cause fever and respiratory symptoms, but they are not specific for IE. An EKG may show signs of myocardial ischemia or arrhythmia, but it is not diagnostic of IE."
