The risk of developing the virus in the exposed group is 500/1000, or 0.5, while the risk in the non-exposed group is 5/1000, or 0.005. Therefore, the relative risk is (0.5 / (1 - 0.5)) / (0.005 / (1 - 0.005)), which simplifies to (0.5 / 0.5) / (0.005 / 0.995), or 100 / 1.005.

Using the given values, we get (500/1000) / (5/1000), which simplifies to 100. Therefore, the relative risk of contracting the virus if exposed is 100 times greater than if not exposed.

Plug in the numbers from the question to get: (500 / (500 + 500)) / (5 / (5 + 995)) = 50 / 0.5 = 100. The relative risk of contracting this virus if exposed is 100.
