Dynein is a motor protein that plays a role in intracellular transport, and it is particularly important for the functioning of cilia and flagella. Both the lower esophageal mucosal cell and small intestinal mucosal cell do not have cilia or flagella. Adipocytes do not depend on dynein for their functioning. However, the Fallopian tube mucosal cell has cilia and is dependent on dynein for their usual movement, helping to move eggs from the ovary to the uterus. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."
