PSA (prostate-specific antigen) is an enzyme produced by the prostate gland, and its main physiological function is to liquefy semen to allow for sperm motility. It is used as a screening tool for prostate cancer, BPH, and prostatitis. None of the other options are related to the function of PSA. Sperm production is mainly regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). The corpus luteum is maintained by luteinizing hormone (LH) after ovulation, and regulation of transcription factors and phosphorylation of proteins is a broad biological process that involves a wide range of enzymes and signaling pathways."
