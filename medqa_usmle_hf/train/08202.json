The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is an X-ray of the hand and wrist to determine bone age and whether growth plates have closed, which can aid in the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency. Measurement of serum insulin-like growth factor concentration or serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration may also be helpful, but an X-ray of the hand and wrist is more specific. An MRI of the brain is not indicated in this case."

The patient presents with short stature and delayed puberty, and both parents have normal height, suggesting a possible growth hormone deficiency. X-ray of the hand and wrist can determine bone age and stage of pubertal development, which can help identify the cause of short stature. Measurement of serum insulin-like growth factor concentration can also help diagnose growth hormone deficiency, but X-ray is the next appropriate step. Measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration and MRI of the brain are not indicated based on the given history and physical examination findings."

Measuring serum insulin-like growth factor concentration may also be helpful in determining a diagnosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Measuring serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration would be more appropriate if there were symptoms or signs of hypothyroidism. MRI of the brain is not necessary at this point in the evaluation."
