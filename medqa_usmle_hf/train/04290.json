Period prevalence refers to the proportion of a population with a particular disease or condition during a specific period. In this example, the study identified the percentage of patients affected by hypodontia during the period from April 2017 to February 2018, making it a measure of period prevalence. Cumulative incidence refers to the proportion of people who develop a condition over a certain period of time, incidence rate refers to the number of new cases of a condition in a population over a certain period of time, and attack rate refers to the proportion of people who become ill after exposure to an infectious agent.
