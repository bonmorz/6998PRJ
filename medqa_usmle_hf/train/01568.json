The patient's symptoms suggest postoperative mediastinitis, a serious complication of sternotomy that can occur in the first 6 weeks after surgery. CT angiography confirms the diagnosis with evidence of fluid collection and subcutaneous tissue stranding. The best next step in management is intravenous antibiotics and debridement of surgical wound, which is the most effective treatment for mediastinitis. Surgical repair of esophageal perforation or aortic injury is not necessary as there is no evidence of perforation or injury. Observation alone is not enough to treat a serious infection, and surgical intervention is necessary to remove infected tissue."

The presence of pain during deep inspiration, fever, erythema, and widened mediastinum with a small pleural effusion suggests the development of mediastinitis, which is a serious complication of sternal wound infections.
