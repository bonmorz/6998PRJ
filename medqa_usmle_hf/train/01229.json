The symptoms, including headaches and blurry vision, suggest increased intracranial pressure, which is confirmed by the elevated opening pressure on LP. The funduscopic findings show papilledema, also indicative of increased intracranial pressure. The patient has past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with metformin, which is not a likely cause of these symptoms. The treatment for increased intracranial pressure is acetazolamide or diuretics, and a common side effect of these medications is kidney stones. Rhabdomyolysis is a potential side effect of statins, not relevant to this patient's case. Decreased white blood cell count and pancreatitis are not side effects of medications used to treat increased intracranial pressure."
