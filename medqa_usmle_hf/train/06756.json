Patient autonomy may be in conflict with reporting laws, therefore, healthcare providers must prioritize reporting potential abuse over patient confidentiality. Options (B) and (C) are incorrect because healthcare providers have a duty to report suspected elder abuse regardless of the patient's wishes, and elder abuse reporting is mandatory in most states. Option (D) is incorrect because waiting for 2 weeks could lead to further harm to the patient if abuse is occurring."
