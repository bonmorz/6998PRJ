The patient presents with symptoms and signs that suggest she may have an ovarian mass or cyst, which requires imaging for further evaluation. A transvaginal ultrasound is the best initial imaging modality for this patient, as it provides better resolution and detail of the pelvic structures compared to a transabdominal ultrasound. Option A is incorrect because additional imaging is required for proper diagnosis, and option C is incorrect because increased adiposity can still interfere with ultrasound imaging quality. Option D is unlikely to be necessary for initial evaluation."
