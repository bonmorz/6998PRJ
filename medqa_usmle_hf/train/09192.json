The patient's symptoms suggest Sjogren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that results in destruction of exocrine glands, leading to dryness of the mouth and eyes. The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis also supports an autoimmune etiology. Uncontrolled blood glucose levels can cause dry mouth, but this is less likely the cause in this case since the patient's vital signs are within normal limits. Obstruction of salivary ducts is a possible cause of dry mouth, but there are no indications for this in the patient's history or physical examination. Poor hygiene due to inability to care for self is also not a likely cause."

The patient's symptoms, together with her medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, suggest the etiology is autoimmune destruction of exocrine glands.

Uncontrolled blood glucose levels may lead to oral problems, but it is less likely to be the sole cause of dry mouth. Obstruction of salivary ducts can also cause dry mouth, but it is less likely since the patient\u2019s physical exam is unremarkable except for the sclera and hand deformity. Poor hygiene is unlikely since the patient did not mention any inability to care for herself."
