The patient\u2019s symptoms and low hemoglobin level with small, pale red blood cells on the peripheral smear suggest iron deficiency anemia, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and leg cramps. Therefore, the most likely supplement to improve the patient\u2019s symptoms is Iron. Calcium is not relevant to the patient\u2019s symptoms, and retinoids are not used to treat anemia. Methylcobalamin is used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, which is not likely the cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms given her recent gastric bypass surgery."
