Aminoglycosides are usually given for surgical prophylaxis due to their effectiveness against Gram-negative bacteria commonly encountered in surgical site infections. However, they are also known to be susceptible to enzymatic inactivation, making them less effective in resistant strains of bacteria. This scenario suggests that the patient was most likely given an aminoglycoside, which was then inactivated by the causal organism."
