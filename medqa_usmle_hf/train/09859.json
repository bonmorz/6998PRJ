Ethanol is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, which is responsible for metabolizing methanol. Administration of ethanol can act as a surrogate substrate and prevent the formation of toxic metabolites of methanol. Methylene blue is used in methemoglobinemia, not methanol toxicity. Atropine is used for bradycardia or as a preoperative medication. Succimer is a chelating agent used for heavy metal poisoning."
