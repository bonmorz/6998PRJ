The non-blanching, raised erythematous papules on the legs suggest leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which can be associated with abdominal pain and joint swelling. The positive stool test and recent use of antibiotics may suggest an underlying infection such as streptococcal infection, but acute rheumatic fever is less likely given the absence of other major criteria. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura and familial Mediterranean fever are less likely given the absence of other characteristic symptoms."
