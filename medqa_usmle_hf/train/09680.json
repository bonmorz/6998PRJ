The symptoms and ECG findings suggest Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome, which is caused by an accessory pathway that bypasses the AV node and connects the atria to the ventricles, leading to a delta wave on the ECG.

The patient has Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome as evidenced by the ECG findings of a shortened PR interval, a wide QRS complex, a delta wave, and an inverted T wave. WPW syndrome is caused by an accessory pathway between the atria and ventricles, which allows for abnormal electrical impulses to bypass the usual conduction system of the heart. This can lead to potentially life-threatening arrhythmias, which is likely what happened in this case leading to sudden cardiac arrest."
