The diagnostic test of choice for this infection is stool culture in sorbitol-MacConkey medium. Option A describes the Gram stain for Campylobacter jejuni. Option B describes sigmoidoscopy, which may be indicated for patients with severe inflammatory bowel disease, but is not necessary at this point in evaluation. Option D describes testing for C. difficile toxins, which is indicated when there is a suspicion of antibiotic-associated diarrhea."

The patient is most likely suffering from E. coli O157:H7 infection, which is commonly associated with bloody diarrhea in children.

The sorbitol-MacConkey medium is a selective culture medium that can isolate E. coli O157:H7 from stool specimens, making it the diagnostic test of choice. Gram stain for gull-winged, curved rods could suggest Campylobacter infections but it is less likely in this case. Sigmoidoscopy and testing stool for C. difficile toxins are also less likely as they are not associated with bloody diarrhea caused by E.coli O157:H7 infection."
