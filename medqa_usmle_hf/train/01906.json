N-acetylglutamate synthase is required for the synthesis of N-acetylglutamate, which is an essential activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI). CPSI is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the urea cycle, and a deficiency in CPSI can lead to hyperammonemia, which is consistent with the patient\u2019s symptoms. Ornithine translocase, argininosuccinase, and arginase are also enzymes in the urea cycle, but their activity is not directly affected by a deficiency in N-acetylglutamate synthase."

The deficiency in N-acetylglutamate synthase leads to decreased production of N-acetylglutamate, which is a cofactor required for the activity of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I. Therefore, the activity of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I is directly affected by this genetic defect. This results in accumulation of ammonia in the body, leading to the symptoms seen in the patient. Ornithine translocase deficiency would lead to hyperammonemia, but it is not associated with N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency. Argininosuccinase deficiency and arginase deficiency are urea cycle disorders that occur downstream, and are not directly affected by the deficiency in N-acetylglutamate synthase."
