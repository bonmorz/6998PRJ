Discontinuing hydroxychloroquine is not necessary as the patient has had no flares during her pregnancy. Reassurance with expectant management is not appropriate given the potential risks to the baby with a low amniotic fluid index."

Cesarean delivery is not indicated in this case. Discontinuing hydroxychloroquine may cause SLE flares, which would be harmful to both the mother and the baby. Reassurance with expectant management is not recommended at 33 weeks as it may increase the risk of fetal distress."
