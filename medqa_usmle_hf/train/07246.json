Since the patient has only had a urine output of 5 mL of blue-tinged urine since surgery, the next best step would be to check the Foley catheter for obstruction or displacement.

Therefore, the next best step in the evaluation of this patient would be to check the Foley catheter to ensure that it is properly placed and not obstructed.

The patient has a history of heavy menses, underwent surgery, and received fluid during the surgery, all of which increase the risk of urinary retention. The fact that the bladder is slightly palpable and a bladder scan shows 250 mL of retained urine suggests that the Foley catheter may be occluded, dislodged, or defective. Checking the Foley catheter is therefore the next best step in the evaluation. Administering a fluid bolus or furosemide may be considered if there is evidence of hypovolemia or volume overload, but the patient's vital signs, urine output during surgery, and laboratory values do not suggest either. Returning to the operating room for emergency surgery is not appropriate based on the information provided."
