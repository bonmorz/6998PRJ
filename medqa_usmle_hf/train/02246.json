The patient\u2019s laboratory values indicate anemia, which is confirmed by the low hemoglobin and hematocrit values and the mild conjunctival pallor. Since the patient has progressive fatigue over the past 4 months, the anemia is likely chronic. The normal platelet and white blood cells counts suggest that the anemia is not due to acute blood loss or hemolysis. Therefore, the most likely reticulocyte range for this patient is <1%, which indicates inadequate bone marrow response to the anemia."
