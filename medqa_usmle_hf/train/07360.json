The patient\u2019s symptoms and laboratory studies suggest a diagnosis of uncomplicated appendicitis, which does not typically require urgent surgery. Conservative management, including bowel rest, IV fluids, and antibiotics, is appropriate for initial treatment. Use of elective laparoscopic appendectomy in 6-8 weeks is recommended in patients with uncomplicated appendicitis, unless there are signs of worsening infection or other complications. Therefore, option (B) is the most appropriate next step in management. Options (A) and (D) are not indicated for uncomplicated appendicitis, which is managed conservatively unless there are signs of worsening infection or other complications. Option (C) is not appropriate as the patient is likely to require surgical intervention for uncomplicated appendicitis, and conservative management alone is usually reserved for patients with suspected, but not confirmed, appendicitis."

The answer, therefore, is to continue conservative management and schedule appendectomy in 6-8 weeks."

A delayed appendectomy can be performed in 6-8 weeks to minimize the risk of surgical complications. Correcting electrolyte imbalances and proceeding to urgent open laparotomy or laparoscopic appendectomy would be too aggressive for the current clinical findings."
