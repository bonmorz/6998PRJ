The patient meets the criteria for Schizophreniform disorder, which includes a duration of symptoms of at least one month but less than six months.

Schizophrenia requires symptoms to last at least six months. Schizoaffective disorder includes both mood disorder and psychotic symptoms, which are present in this patient.

Schizophrenia requires symptoms to be present for 6 months or longer. Schizoaffective disorder requires the patient to have an affective episode during the active phase of symptoms, and thus does not fit this patient\u2019s presentation. Schizotypal personality disorder involves long-term patterns of odd or eccentric behavior and difficulty with social relationships, but typically lacks the presence of delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech."
