The mass is located in the left parietal lobe with a significant midline shift to the right.

Pituitary adenomas are located in the sella turcica, and ependymomas and oligodendrogliomas are typically located in the ventricles."

The recurrence of headaches and irritability could be related to the increased intracranial pressure caused by the tumor. Spastic paresis of the right lower extremity and a positive Babinski sign suggest upper motor neuron involvement, which is common in patients with meningiomas. Pituitary adenoma would usually present with endocrine disturbances, while ependymomas and oligodendrogliomas are less likely based on the location and appearance of the mass on imaging."
