The most likely diagnosis is hereditary spherocytosis, which is caused by a defect in the spectrin protein in the RBC membrane.

The symptoms described suggest hemolytic anemia, as evidenced by the low hemoglobin level, elevated bilirubin and LDH levels, and jaundice. The spleen being palpable indicates it is involved in clearing the damaged red blood cells. The most likely cause of these findings is defective spectrin in the RBC membrane, which is characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis. Decreased synthesis of alpha chains of hemoglobin can result in alpha-thalassemia, but this does not typically present with jaundice and spleen involvement. Thrombotic microangiopathy and decreased CD55 and CD59 in RBC are more suggestive of hemolytic uremic syndrome, which presents with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, neither of which are present in this case."
