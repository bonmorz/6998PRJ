The onset of jaundice after 24 hours of age and peak bilirubin levels less than 20 mg/dL suggest physiologic neonatal jaundice. However, the history of a sibling who died after liver surgery raises concerns for biliary atresia. The low levels of alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT suggest decreased liver function, but breast milk jaundice is a common cause of prolonged jaundice in exclusively breastfed infants and is characterized by elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin with no other abnormalities. Therefore, breast milk jaundice is the most likely diagnosis in this case."
