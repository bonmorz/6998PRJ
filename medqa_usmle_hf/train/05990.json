Neutrophil extravasation from blood vessels into tissues involves a series of steps: (1) rolling, (2) tight adhesion, (3) diapedesis, (4) migration. LFA-1 (integrin) is responsible for tight adhesion, while ICAM-1 is involved in margination. E-selectin is also involved in rolling, but the question asks for the correct pairing for the defective molecule, and in this case, it is LFA-1 and tight adhesion."

The correct answer is (C) LFA-1 (integrin), which affects tight adhesion, the step in which neutrophils firmly adhere to the endothelial cells lining blood vessels before they can squeeze through to reach infected tissue. ICAM-1 and E-selectin are also involved in the overall process of extravasation, but they affect margination and tight adhesion, respectively."

The correct pairing is LFA-1 (integrin) and tight adhesion. This is because LFA-1 is responsible for binding to ICAM-1 on endothelial cells, which leads to tight adhesion of neutrophils to the endothelial cells before they can extravasate into the tissues. Defects in LFA-1 result in impaired tight adhesion and reduced extravasation, leading to a higher risk of infections. The other options are not correct pairings, as ICAM-1 also plays a role in tight adhesion and margination, and E-selectin is involved in the initial rolling step of extravasation."
