The symptoms suggest that the patient is experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as she has nightmares about the traumatic event, avoids reminders of the trauma, and is experiencing emotional numbness. Acute stress disorder typically lasts for a shorter duration and is characterized by dissociative symptoms. Major depressive disorder involves persistent feelings of sadness, guilt, and hopelessness. Adjustment disorder involves the development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to a stressor but does not meet the diagnostic criteria for another disorder."
