The symptoms and the fact that the patient is exclusively breastfed suggest that the most likely cause of the blood-tinged stools and mucoid strings is cow's milk protein allergy. Continuing breastfeeding and advising the mother to avoid dairy and soy products is the most appropriate next step in management. Option A is not indicated since celiac disease is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of other symptoms. Option C is not indicated as stool antigen immunoassay is used to detect infections and is not helpful in diagnosing cow's milk protein allergy. Option D is not appropriate since there is no evidence of a need to stop breastfeeding, and switching to soy-based formula may not necessarily address the issue if the patient has soy protein allergy."

The patient's blood-tinged stools and passing whitish mucoid strings suggest allergic colitis, which is common in exclusively breastfed infants. The fact that the patient's blood count and serum electrolyte concentrations are normal, and that the patient appears healthy and active, confirms this diagnosis. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to continue breastfeeding and advise the mother to avoid dairy and soy products, as these can exacerbate allergic colitis. Options A and C are not relevant to the diagnosis of allergic colitis. Option D is incorrect because stopping breastfeeding and switching to soy-based formula can worsen the patient's symptoms."
