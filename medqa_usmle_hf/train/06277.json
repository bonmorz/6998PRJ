The patient\u2019s medical history of hypertension and constipation-dominant IBS suggests that Levonorgestrel would be the most appropriate form of contraception, as it is a progesterone-only pill that does not increase the risk of blood clots or exacerbate constipation. The use of estrogen-containing contraceptives is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypertension and Wilson\u2019s disease. Copper IUD is also an option, but since the patient has just had her menstrual period, Levonorgestrel is a simpler and more immediate option. Depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate is not recommended due to the risk of worsening constipation."
