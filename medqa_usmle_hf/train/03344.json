The question asks for the blood type situation that would put the fetus at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn, which occurs when maternal antibodies attack fetal red blood cells. This can happen if the fetus inherits a blood type from the father that is different from the mother's blood type, causing the mother's immune system to recognize the fetal blood cells as foreign and produce antibodies against them. In this case, the most likely scenario is that the mother is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive, as this would result in sensitization to the Rh antigen in the second and subsequent Rh+ pregnancies. Choice (B) is the only option that fits this scenario, with the mother being A-negative and the father being B-positive."
