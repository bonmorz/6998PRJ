Carbidopa inhibits the peripheral decarboxylation of levodopa, allowing more levodopa to reach the brain, which increases dopamine levels. However, it can cause nausea and vomiting, so an antiemetic such as metoclopramide, which inhibits aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, is given to prevent adverse effects."

The most effective treatment is levodopa, which is converted to dopamine in the brain to alleviate symptoms. However, levodopa can cause adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting if it is metabolized outside the brain. Therefore, carbidopa is given with levodopa to inhibit aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, which is responsible for the peripheral metabolism of levodopa. Option (C) is the correct answer."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest Parkinson\u2019s disease and the most effective treatment is levodopa, which needs a second drug to prevent its side effects. Among the options, only inhibiting aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase will slow down the conversion of levodopa to dopamine before it reaches the brain, preventing adverse effects. Blocking muscarinic acetylcholine receptors can cause dry mouth and constipation. Inhibiting catechol-O-methyltransferase and inhibiting monoamine oxidase-B can also help treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, but they are not the answer to the question."

The patient\u2019s symptoms and physical examination suggest Parkinson\u2019s disease, which is treated with dopamine replacement therapy. The drug given to prevent adverse effects is a COMT inhibitor, which blocks the breakdown of dopamine in the periphery and prolongs its effects in the brain. Option A is a side effect of some medications used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease. Option B is a medication used to prolong the effects of levodopa. Option D is a medication used to reduce the breakdown of dopamine in the brain. Option C is the correct answer because inhibiting aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase helps increase dopamine in the brain by preventing its breakdown before it reaches the brain."
