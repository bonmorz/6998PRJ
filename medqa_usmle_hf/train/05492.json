In cases of suspected ingestion of an unknown amount of an alkali substance, close observation is recommended for at least 2 to 3 weeks due to the potential for delayed damage to the esophagus. Urgent endoscopy is not always necessary, especially if the patient is asymptomatic and the ingestion was recent. Nasogastric tube placement and titration with a weak acid are not recommended."
