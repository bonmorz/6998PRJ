The patient\u2019s bimanual pelvic examination suggests an irregularly enlarged uterus, and the transvaginal ultrasound reveals a singular hypoechoic mass inside the myometrial wall. These findings are consistent with a leiomyoma, which is a benign smooth muscle tumor of the uterus. Endometrial cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma can also cause an enlarged uterus, but they usually have different characteristics on ultrasound. Endometrial hyperplasia is a precursor to endometrial cancer, but it is not typically associated with an enlarged uterus on examination."

The patient has an irregularly enlarged uterus and a hypoechoic mass inside the myometrial wall which suggests Leiomyoma, also known as uterine fibroids. It is a common benign tumor that occurs in women of reproductive age. The risk factors for uterine fibroids are obesity, nulliparity, and African-American ethnicity. Endometrial cancer and leiomyosarcoma usually present with irregular bleeding, which is not seen in this case. Endometrial hyperplasia may cause an enlarged uterus, but it typically presents with abnormal uterine bleeding."
