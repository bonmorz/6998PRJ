Foscarnet also treats CMV but does not require phosphorylation, and Ganciclovir is phosphorylated regardless of the type of protein it is mixed with. Oseltamivir is an antiviral drug used to treat influenza and is not effective against CMV."

Because the patient has a low CD4+ count, it suggests that he is immunocompromised and therefore susceptible to infections such as human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). The drug remains unphosphorylated when mixed with HSV and CMV proteins, but is phosphorylated when mixed with human proteins, suggesting that the drug targets a human enzyme that is not present in HSV or CMV. This is consistent with the mechanism of action of Cidofovir, which is a nucleotide analogue that is phosphorylated by host cell enzymes and then competes with natural nucleotides in viral DNA replication."
