The patient\u2019s increased use of albuterol inhaler suggests that his asthma is not well controlled with fluticasone alone, indicating a need for additional bronchodilator therapy. Salmeterol is a long-acting bronchodilator that can be added to his current regimen to improve asthma control. Discontinuing fluticasone is not recommended as it is a controller medication, and replacing it with salmeterol alone is also not appropriate. Cromolyn is a mast cell stabilizer and ipratropium is an anticholinergic agent, which are not recommended as initial therapy in this case."

Discontinuing fluticasone or adding cromolyn or ipratropium are not appropriate choices for addressing the patient's shortness of breath and need for additional long-acting bronchodilator therapy."

The patient is experiencing worsening symptoms despite his regular use of fluticasone, indicating that his therapy needs to be adjusted. Adding salmeterol, a long-acting beta-agonist, to the current regimen is an appropriate choice to provide additional bronchodilation and improve symptoms. Discontinuing fluticasone or replacing it with salmeterol would not adequately control his underlying inflammation. Cromolyn is a mast cell stabilizer that may be used as an additional therapy, but it is not typically used as a first-line treatment. Ipratropium is a short-acting anticholinergic that may also be used in conjunction with a beta-agonist, but it is not necessary in this case as the patient's symptoms are not severe."

The fact that the patient has been using his albuterol inhaler every day for the past month and has felt more short of breath led to the conclusion that his symptoms are not controlled, and additional measures are needed.

Discontinuing fluticasone, a corticosteroid, is not recommended as it is an important component for long-term control of asthma. Adding cromolyn, a mast cell stabilizer, may be beneficial in some cases but not as a first-line therapy.
