No further workup needed is not appropriate as further management is needed to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications such as splenic rupture."

The most appropriate next step in management is to confirm the diagnosis with a Monospot test, which detects heterophile antibodies commonly found in infectious mononucleosis. Amoxicillin is contraindicated in patients with infectious mononucleosis due to the risk of developing a rash or other allergic reactions. No further workup is not appropriate in this case.
