Laboratory studies show low hemoglobin, high LDH, and no abnormalities in the peripheral blood smear. These symptoms suggest malignancy, and the patient's family history of lymphoma increases the likelihood of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) as the diagnosis. Drug-induced lymphadenopathy, cytomegalovirus infection, and multiple myeloma are less likely based on the patient's presentation and laboratory studies."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including painless swelling of lymph nodes, night sweats, weight loss, and elevated LDH, suggest lymphoma. The patient\u2019s family history of lymphoma and the presence of lymphadenopathy in multiple regions further support this diagnosis. Drug-induced lymphadenopathy typically occurs shortly after starting a medication and is not associated with night sweats, weight loss, or splenomegaly. Cytomegalovirus infection can cause lymphadenopathy and fever, but is less likely given the absence of other symptoms such as hepatosplenomegaly and atypical lymphocytosis. Multiple myeloma is not likely given the absence of bone pain and characteristic findings such as the presence of monoclonal protein in serum or urine."
