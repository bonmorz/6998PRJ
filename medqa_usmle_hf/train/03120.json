To calculate the NNH, we need to use the absolute risk increase (ARI) calculated as the difference in the risk of the outcome between the exposed and control groups. In this case, the ARI is (18/50) - (7/50) = 0.22 or 22%. The NNH is then calculated as the reciprocal of the ARI, which is approximately 4.5. This means that for every 4-5 people exposed to childhood 2nd-hand smoking, one additional person will develop BA. The NNH is inversely correlated with the ARI and relative risk increase, so answer (C) is correct. Answers (A), (B), and (D) are not accurate statements about the NNH."

In this case, the risk factor is childhood exposure to 2nd-hand smoking and the adverse event is BA. The incidence of BA is higher in the exposed group compared to controls, suggesting that exposure to 2nd-hand smoking is a risk factor for BA. As the relative risk increase (exposed group vs controls) increases, the NNH decreases, indicating that higher relative risk increase means that fewer patients need to be exposed to 2nd-hand smoking to cause one additional case of BA. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). Option A is incorrect as it suggests that the NNH will decrease if the incidence of BA increases in the control group, which is not necessarily true. Option B is incorrect as it suggests that the NNH will increase if the incidence of BA increases in the experimental group, which is also not necessarily true.

Using the incidence rates calculated above, we get NNH = 1 / (0.36 - 0.14) = 4. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the NNH does not depend on the incidence rate in the control group, but rather on the difference in incidence rates between the exposed and control groups. Option B is incorrect because an increase in incidence in the experimental group would decrease the NNH, since the risk factor is now affecting more individuals. Option D is incorrect because an increase in absolute risk in the exposed group would decrease the NNH, since the risk factor is now affecting more individuals. \n\nOption C is correct because the NNH is inversely correlated with the relative risk increase, which makes intuitive sense - if the relative risk increase is larger, fewer individuals would need to be exposed to the risk factor in order for one additional individual to develop the adverse outcome, leading to a lower NNH."

The Number Needed to Harm (NNH) is a measure of the number of people needed to be exposed to a particular risk factor to cause harm in one individual. In this case, the study looks at the effect of childhood exposure to 2nd-hand smoking on the incidence of bronchogenic adenocarcinoma. Based on the data provided, the relative risk of BA in the exposed group compared to the control group is (18/50)/(7/50) = 2.57. The NNH can be calculated using the formula: 1/(AR control - AR exposed), where AR represents the absolute risk of developing BA. Using the data, the AR control = 7/50 = 0.14 and the AR exposed = 18/50 = 0.36. Therefore, the NNH is 1/(0.14 - 0.36) = 3.33, meaning that for every 3.33 people exposed to childhood 2nd-hand smoking, one person will develop BA.
