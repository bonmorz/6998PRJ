Sensitivity measures the proportion of true positives that are correctly identified, while specificity measures the proportion of true negatives that are correctly identified. If the cut-off level is raised, it will be more difficult to obtain positive results, leading to a decrease in sensitivity. However, since higher levels of the serum marker will be required for a positive result, there will be fewer false positive results, leading to an increase in specificity. Therefore, the correct answer is (C): sensitivity decreases, specificity increases."
