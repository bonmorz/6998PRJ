The patient's symptoms, including slurred speech, diplopia, and ataxic gait, suggest that she is experiencing adverse effects from the increased dose of paroxetine and/or her anti-seizure medication. Lowering the dose of her anti-seizure medication would be an appropriate next step. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is used to treat acute ischemic stroke, but the CT scan revealed no acute pathology. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is an antibiotic and is not indicated in this case. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be indicated in cases of severe malnutrition, but there is no indication that this patient requires TPN at this time."
