The outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria contains lipopolysaccharides that can activate Toll-like receptors on immune cells, leading to an inflammatory response. Teichoic acid is found in the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria, and while it can stimulate the immune system, it is not present in Proteus.
