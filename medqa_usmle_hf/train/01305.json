However, given that the patient is only at 26 weeks gestation, induction of labor or cesarean delivery poses a high risk of morbidity and mortality for the mother and fetus. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step is to plan for oxytocin administration to induce labor, which allows for a viable delivery and minimizes risks for the mother and fetus. Magnesium sulfate may be used to prevent seizures in the setting of preeclampsia or eclampsia, which is not indicated in this scenario.
