The patient presents with a slowly enlarging nodule on the left upper eyelid that has persisted despite treatment with warm compresses, which suggests a possible tumor. The most appropriate next step is to perform a biopsy to identify the nature of the lesion. Eyelid hygiene and cryotherapy are inadequate measures for the management of a solitary, nontender nodule on the eyelid. Mohs micrographic surgery is a technique for removing skin cancers."
