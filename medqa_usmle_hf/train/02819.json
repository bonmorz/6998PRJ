Elevated levels of ALT can indicate liver inflammation and may help diagnose the cause of the patient's symptoms. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is elevated in cases of liver or bone disease but may not be specific enough to diagnose the cause in this patient. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is also a liver enzyme, but it can be elevated in other conditions such as heart disease, and may not be specific enough to diagnose the cause of the patient's symptoms.
