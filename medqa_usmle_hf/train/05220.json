The symptoms and the adrenal mass suggest pheochromocytoma, which causes episodic hypertension, headaches, palpitations, and sweating due to the release of catecholamines. Phenoxybenzamine is the initial pharmacotherapy for this patient as it blocks the alpha-adrenergic receptors on the smooth muscles, thus decreasing blood pressure. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, can be used as adjunct therapy, but should not be given as initial therapy as it can make hypertension worse. Clonidine, an alpha-agonist, can decrease blood pressure, but its effects are short-lasting and it can cause rebound hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, is not the initial pharmacotherapy for pheochromocytoma as it can worsen hypertension due to the increased renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation."
