The peroxidase positive eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions suggest Chronic eosinophilic leukemia, which is associated with a fusion protein known as FIP1L1-PDGFRA. This fusion protein recruits histone acetylase proteins to activate gene expression, leading to leukemic transformation. Therefore, answer choice (D), Recruiting histone acetylase proteins, is the correct answer."

The symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), which is characterized by the presence of peroxidase-positive eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions. The abnormal protein associated with CML is the BCR-ABL fusion protein, which results from the translocation of genetic material between chromosomes 9 and 22. The protein has tyrosine kinase activity and recruits histone acetylase proteins, which leads to altered gene expression and uncontrolled cell proliferation. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) recruiting histone acetylase proteins."
