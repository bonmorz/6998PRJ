The patient's symptoms, elevated hematocrit and history of polycythemia vera suggest the possibility of hepatocellular carcinoma. Tenderness in the RUQ and shifting dullness suggest ascites. The diagnostic paracentesis reveals ascites with low albumin and low WBC count, which is suggestive of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Ultrasound is the best next step in management to identify if there is any evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma or to confirm the presence of ascites and evaluate the liver and portal vasculature.
