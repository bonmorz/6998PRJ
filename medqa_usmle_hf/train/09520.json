After ileal resection, there may be changes in bile metabolism due to alterations in enterohepatic circulation.

Enteric bacteria may also change due to alterations in nutrient availability, but it is not specified whether they will remain the same or not. Absorption of 7\u03b1-dehydroxylated bile may decrease due to reduced bacterial metabolism of primary bile acids in the ileum, which normally results in the synthesis of secondary bile acids."
