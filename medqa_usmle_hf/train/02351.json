Since the patient is stable, the liver mass is likely a benign hepatic adenoma and can be managed with observation and follow-up imaging to monitor growth.

Discontinuing the oral contraceptive may be recommended to decrease the risk of recurrence or growth, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management."
