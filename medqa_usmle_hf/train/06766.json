The INR of 6.5 indicates severe coagulopathy, and the abdominal pain and epistaxis suggest possible ingestion of a poison. Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma are used to treat coagulation disorders. Packed red blood cells transfusion is not indicated based on the Hgb level. DMSA is indicated for heavy metal poisoning, which is not the most likely cause in this case. Protamine sulfate is used to reverse heparin-induced anticoagulation, which is not applicable in this case."
