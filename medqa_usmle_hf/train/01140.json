The symptoms suggest intraventricular hemorrhage, which is common in premature newborns and can cause seizures, lethargy, and decreased muscle tone.

Galactosemia and spinal muscular atrophy are genetic conditions that would not present with acute symptoms shortly after birth. Congenital hydrocephalus can cause a tense anterior fontanelle and slow eye movements, but it is unlikely to present with seizures and decreased muscle tone so soon after birth."

Galactosemia and spinal muscular atrophy are metabolic and neuromuscular disorders respectively, and are less likely in this case.

Galactosemia is a metabolic disorder that would present with symptoms like jaundice and liver dysfunction.

Congenital hydrocephalus would present with enlarged head circumference and neurological symptoms, but there is no mention of head enlargement in the case."
