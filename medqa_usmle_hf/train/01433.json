The patient's elevated blood pressure, BMI, waist circumference, and triglycerides, as well as low HDL cholesterol, suggest that he has metabolic syndrome.

Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells is the mechanism of type 1 diabetes, while excess cortisol secretion and activity is the mechanism of Cushing's syndrome. LDL receptor gene mutation is the mechanism of familial hypercholesterolemia, which is characterized by early onset of elevated LDL cholesterol and increased risk of cardiovascular disease."
