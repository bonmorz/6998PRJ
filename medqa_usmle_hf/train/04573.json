The symptoms of hair loss, irregular menses, and scattered pustules on the face suggest polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The patches of hyperpigmentation suggest Addison's disease. The morning cortisol level of 18 \u03bcg/dL is within normal range, but the combination of symptoms suggests increased stimulation of the adrenal cortex. Zona fasciculata cells secrete cortisol, but they are not specifically associated with PCOS or Addison's disease. Granulosa cells and follicular thyroid cells are not associated with adrenal function. Theca interna cells, which are located in the ovary, are involved in androgen production and are often involved in the pathophysiology of PCOS. Therefore, increased stimulation of theca interna cells is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms."

The pustules on the face and patches of hyperpigmentation on the axillae and groin suggest polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is commonly associated with hair loss. PCOS is characterized by an increase in androgen production, which is predominantly secreted by theca interna cells in the ovaries. Therefore, the answer is (B). Zona fasciculata cells produce cortisol, which is not directly associated with hair loss. Granulosa cells are involved in ovulation and follicular thyroid cells produce thyroid hormone."

The irregular menses, hyperpigmentation, and scattered pustules suggest a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Zona fasciculata cells produce cortisol, which is within normal levels, and therefore unlikely to be the cause. Granulosa cells are involved in follicular development and ovulation, and follicular thyroid cells produce thyroid hormone, neither of which are significantly associated with PCOS."
