The elevated glucose levels (> 250 mg/dL), presence of ketones in urine, and fruity smell to breath all support this diagnosis. The laboratory results also reveal a low pH indicating acidosis, which is a hallmark of DKA. Blunt trauma, fecalith, and gut contents in the abdominal cavity are not associated with these symptoms. Therefore, the answer is (B) burn out of pancreatic beta cells, which refers to the lack of insulin secretion leading to hyperglycemia and subsequent ketosis."

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which occurs as a result of insulin deficiency leading to an increase in glucose production and ketone body formation. The fruity smell on his breath indicates that he is producing ketones, and his blood glucose level of 450 mg/dL confirms that he has hyperglycemia. Blunt trauma to the abdomen or fecalith in the ceacum would present with different symptoms and exam findings, while the presence of gut contents in the abdominal cavity would present with more severe symptoms and exam findings."
