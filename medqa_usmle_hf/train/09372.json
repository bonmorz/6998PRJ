The patient\u2019s presentation, including watery diarrhea and low blood pressure, suggests secretory diarrhea, which is caused by an excessive production of fluid in the intestinal lumen. Invasive diarrhea is characterized by the invasion of enteric organisms that damage the surface of the intestinal mucosa. Osmotic diarrhea is caused by the ingestion of poorly absorbed substances that remain in the intestinal lumen and draw water into the lumen. Steatorrhea is characterized by malabsorption of fat and is not related to the patient\u2019s symptoms."

The symptoms of watery stool suggest secretory diarrhea, which is caused by bacterial toxins or viruses that stimulate the secretion of electrolytes and water into the intestinal lumen, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Invasive diarrhea is characterized by the invasion of intestinal epithelial cells by pathogens, causing bloody or mucus-filled stool. Osmotic diarrhea is caused by malabsorption or a high intake of poorly absorbable substances, leading to an osmotic gradient that draws water into the lumen. Steatorrhea is characterized by the presence of excessive fat in the stool, which can indicate digestive or malabsorption disorders."
