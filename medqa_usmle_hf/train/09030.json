Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, which means it can be stored in the fatty tissues of the body. Therefore, the correct answer is (A), it is a fat-soluble vitamin. The other options are incorrect as Vitamin C and B complex are water-soluble vitamins, while parathyroid hormone is produced by chief cells of the parathyroid gland and oxyphil cells produce unknown substances."
