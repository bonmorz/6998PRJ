Among the options, only a history of surgery within the last 30 days is considered a high-risk factor. Use of oral contraceptives and history of smoking are considered moderate-risk factors, while history of travel is considered a low-risk factor. The patient\u2019s presentation also suggests pulmonary embolism, with crackles over the right inframammary region and tenderness and pain in the left calf region. Further testing and treatment are necessary."
