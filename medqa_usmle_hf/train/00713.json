The symptoms, including swelling, erythema, and tenderness over the inferior patella suggest inflammation of a periarticular fluid-filled sac, which is characteristic of prepatellar bursitis. Noninflammatory degeneration of the joint (osteoarthritis) is more commonly seen in older patients with chronic joint pain. Infection of the joint (septic arthritis) would present with more severe pain, fever, and joint line tenderness. Deposition of crystals in the joint (gout) would present with joint line tenderness and warmth, and typically affects the first metatarsophalangeal joint."

The most likely underlying cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms is inflammation of a periarticular fluid-filled sac, which is consistent with prepatellar bursitis. The fluctuance over the inferior patella is a classic finding. The patient's recent toe stubbing is likely unrelated, as there is no joint line tenderness or warmth, and the limited range of flexion is due to pain rather than mechanical blockage. The other options, such as infection or crystal deposition, are less likely given the lack of other associated symptoms and findings."
