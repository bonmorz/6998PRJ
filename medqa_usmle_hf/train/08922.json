Therefore, despite having a normal allele, the abnormal expression of the paternal allele leads to the patient\u2019s condition. Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, locus heterogeneity, and uniparental disomy are not relevant in this case."

In this syndrome, only the maternal allele is expressed and the paternal allele is silenced. The patient in this question has only one mutated allele, but because of imprinting, the normal allele from the father is not expressed, leading to the patient's phenotype. This is a classic example of imprinting."

Uniparental disomy is when both copies of a chromosome come from one parent, which is also not applicable in this case. Imprinting is the most likely explanation as it refers to the differential expression of genes depending on whether they are inherited from the mother or the father. In this case, the mutated allele may be on the paternal chromosome, which is silenced due to imprinting, leaving only the mutated allele on the maternal chromosome expressed. This can result in the patient being affected despite having one normal allele."
