The patient\u2019s presentation is consistent with Marfan syndrome, which is a disorder caused by a mutation in the Fibrillin gene. This gene encodes for fibrillin-1, a protein that is essential for the formation of elastic fibers in connective tissue. Defects in fibrillin-1 cause abnormalities in several structures including the skeleton, eyes, and cardiovascular system. Type I collagen is the major protein in bone and connective tissue, and mutations in this protein cause osteogenesis imperfecta. Elastin is another protein involved in the formation of elastic fibers but is not associated with Marfan syndrome. Finally, ATP7A is a gene involved in copper metabolism and mutations in this gene cause Menkes disease, which is characterized by connective tissue abnormalities, but not typically associated with scoliosis or upward lens dislocation."
