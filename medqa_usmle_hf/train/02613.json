The patient's symptoms suggest a diagnosis of X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, which is caused by a mutation in the EDA gene located on the X chromosome. Therefore, the most likely cause of this condition is paternal inheritance, as it is an X-linked disorder. Maternal inheritance would have a different pattern of inheritance, while nutritional and metabolic causes would not explain the specific symptoms observed."

The symptoms point towards a genetic disorder, and since the parents are not affected, the condition is most likely due to a spontaneous mutation. Since the boy's symptoms match those of X-linked recessive inheritance, the mode of inheritance is most likely paternal. Therefore, the correct answer is (B). Nutritional and metabolic causes can lead to short stature, but the other symptoms, such as hypopigmentation and hypotonia, suggest a genetic disorder."

The symptoms suggest X-linked recessive inheritance, meaning the boy inherited the condition from his mother who carries the mutated gene on her X chromosome. This rules out options A and C. The symptoms of hypotonia, difficulty in sucking and swallowing, and delayed motor milestones suggest a genetic/metabolic cause rather than a nutritional cause, ruling out option D. Therefore, option B, paternal inheritance, is the most likely cause, as the father's X chromosome would not have the mutated gene. The condition described is consistent with X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia."
