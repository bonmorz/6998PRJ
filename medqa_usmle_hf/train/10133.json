Alternative splicing is the process by which different combinations of exons are included or excluded from the final mRNA transcript. In this case, the inclusion of a certain exon leads to the production of a transmembrane form of the Fas protein, which promotes apoptosis. This demonstrates how alternative splicing can lead to different protein isoforms with distinct functions."

Alternative splicing is a process that allows for multiple proteins to be produced from a single gene by selectively including or excluding certain exons. In this case, the inclusion of a certain exon leads to the production of a membrane bound Fas protein that promotes apoptosis, while exclusion of this exon leads to production of a soluble form that prevents apoptosis. Base excision repair, histone deacetylation, and post-translational modifications do not directly explain this finding."

The question involves the process of alternative splicing, which is the mechanism by which different mRNA transcripts are produced from the same gene.

Alternative splicing is a mechanism that allows for the selection and joining of different exons within the pre-mRNA transcript to create different protein products. In this case, the inclusion of a certain exon leads to the formation of a membrane-bound Fas protein that promotes apoptosis, whereas exclusion of that exon leads to the formation of a soluble form of Fas that prevents programmed cell death. Base excision repair is a DNA repair mechanism, histone deacetylation is a process that regulates gene expression, and post-translational modifications occur after protein synthesis and can affect protein function, but none of these directly account for the switch between soluble and membrane-bound forms of Fas."
