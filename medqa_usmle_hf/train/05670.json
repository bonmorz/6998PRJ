Weakness in shoulder abduction is a typical sign of serratus anterior paralysis. Scapular protrusion while pressing against a wall is also a characteristic sign of serratus anterior paralysis, as the scapula fails to rotate properly. The other options do not involve the serratus anterior muscle or its nerve supply."
