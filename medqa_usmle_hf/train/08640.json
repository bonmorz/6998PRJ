The parathyroid glands are adjacent to the thyroid gland and may be inadvertently removed during thyroidectomy, resulting in hypoparathyroidism. Hypoparathyroidism is associated with decreased cAMP signaling which leads to decreased calcium absorption in the gut and decreased calcium reabsorption in the kidneys, causing hypocalcemia."

The symptoms suggest hypocalcemia, which can occur after thyroidectomy due to unintentional damage to the parathyroid glands. The signaling pathway of the deficient hormone responsible for this patient\u2019s symptoms is through the second messenger cAMP. When parathormone binds to its receptor, it activates adenylyl cyclase, which produces cAMP. cAMP then activates protein kinase A, which in turn activates calcium channels in target cells, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)."
