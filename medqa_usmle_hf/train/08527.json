The small mass on the posterior aspect of the tongue suggests that the hyper-functional thyroid tissue is located at the base of the tongue, which is a rare location for ectopic thyroid tissue. The correct answer is (C). Option (A) is incorrect as there is no evidence of additional thyroid tissue in the neck. Option (B) is incorrect as there is no male predilection for this condition. Option (D) is incorrect as this condition is caused by a failure of cranial migration of thyroid tissue."

The presence of a small mass on the posterior aspect of the tongue that moves with movements of the tongue, along with the radioiodine thyroid scan, suggests that the hyper-functional tissue is located at the base of the tongue, which is an example of ectopic thyroid tissue. The most likely cause of ectopic thyroid tissue at the base of the tongue is a failure of caudal migration of thyroid tissue during embryonic development. Option A is incorrect because ectopic thyroid tissue at the base of the tongue does not necessarily imply the presence of additional thyroid tissue elsewhere in the neck. Option B is incorrect because there is no gender predilection for this condition. Option C is incorrect because ectopic thyroid tissue can occur in various locations and there is no evidence to suggest that its location at the base of the tongue is the rarest."
