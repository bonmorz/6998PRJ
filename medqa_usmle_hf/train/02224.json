Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) is a term used to describe abnormal changes to the cells found on the surface of the cervix. These changes are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and can progress to cervical cancer over time. The process leading to LSIL is dysplasia, which is an abnormal growth of cells within a tissue or organ. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) dysplasia. Hypertrophy refers to an increase in cell size, while atrophy refers to a decrease in cell size. Anaplasia refers to a lack of differentiation in cells, which can be a sign of cancer. None of these processes are specifically associated with LSIL."
