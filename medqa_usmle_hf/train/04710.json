The patient's symptoms and regular menstruation cycle suggest the most likely cause of the pain is a ruptured ovarian cyst, which produces progesterone. Progesterone stimulates the activity of cholesterol desmolase, therefore increasing progesterone synthesis. Option B is incorrect as it describes the function of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), not the hormone responsible for the patient's symptoms. Option C and D are incorrect as neither directly relate to the function of the hormone responsible for the patient's symptoms."

The patient\u2019s symptoms and negative pregnancy test suggest that she is not pregnant, and the pain is located at the RLQ, which is commonly associated with appendicitis. Increased activity of cholesterol desmolase to synthesize progesterone is the main function of luteinizing hormone (LH), which is primarily responsible for this patient\u2019s symptoms. Progesterone causes relaxation of smooth muscles, including the muscles of the digestive tract, which may lead to abdominal pain, constipation, and bloating. LH peaks just before ovulation, which may correlate with the timing of the patient\u2019s pain."

Progesterone increases the activity of cholesterol desmolase, which leads to the synthesis of more progesterone, as well as cortisol and aldosterone. This hormone is responsible for the growth and development of the endometrium in preparation for implantation and pregnancy. In some cases, it can cause the smooth muscle of the uterus and fallopian tubes to contract, leading to pain and discomfort."
