The patient's symptoms and recent exposure to someone with infectious mononucleosis suggest that the most likely cause of the rash is Epstein-Barr virus, and therefore azithromycin therapy is appropriate for bacterial secondary infections that may occur with viral infections. Acyclovir therapy is used for herpes virus infections, which is not the most likely cause of the rash in this case. Amoxicillin and cephalexin are both beta-lactam antibiotics and may cause an allergic reaction in patients with a history of anaphylaxis to dicloxacillin. Therefore, azithromycin is the most appropriate next step in management."

The symptoms and the presence of tonsillar erythema and exudate suggest that the most likely diagnosis is streptococcal pharyngitis.

Azithromycin is the recommended treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis in patients with penicillin allergy. Amoxicillin is the first-line treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis in patients without penicillin allergy. Acyclovir is used to treat viral infections such as herpes simplex virus, which is not the likely cause of this patient's symptoms.

The patient has symptoms consistent with a viral infection, and the presence of tonsillar exudate suggests strep throat. However, the rash suggests a viral exanthem. Given the patient's history of allergic reaction to dicloxacillin, amoxicillin therapy may not be appropriate. Acyclovir is used to treat herpes virus infections, which would not manifest as a punctate erythematous rash. Cephalexin is an antibiotic, but not typically used to treat viral infections. Azithromycin therapy is appropriate for the treatment of strep throat or other bacterial infections that may be present, and can also treat atypical respiratory tract infections that may be associated with the patient's symptoms."

Acyclovir is used to treat viral infections caused by herpes viruses, while antibiotics (amoxicillin, cephalexin, azithromycin) are not indicated for viral infections. Azithromycin can be used to treat bacterial infections, but based on the presentation and history, mono is the more likely diagnosis."

The patient's symptoms suggest that he may have developed a rash due to a viral infection like infectious mononucleosis.

Acyclovir is used to treat viral infections like herpes, but is not effective for infectious mononucleosis. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that can be used to treat bacterial infections like streptococcal pharyngitis, which can present with similar symptoms, but in this case the presence of a rash suggests a viral etiology. Therefore, azithromycin is the most appropriate next step in management."
