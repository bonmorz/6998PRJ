The wound on the upper margin of the right clavicle in the parasternal line is in close proximity to the lungs, indicating the likelihood of a pneumothorax due to pleural injury. Rotator cuff tear due to supraspinatus muscle injury would cause shoulder pain and weakness, trapezius muscle paresis due to spinal accessory nerve injury would cause weakness and limited movement of the shoulder blade, and traumatic aneurysm due to internal carotid artery injury would cause neurological symptoms. None of these are indicated in the question stem."
