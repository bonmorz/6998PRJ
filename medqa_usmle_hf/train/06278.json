Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to measure TSH levels to confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. Observing and waiting or measuring D-Dimer levels are not appropriate for this presentation.

Observation and waiting may not be appropriate if the patient\u2019s symptoms are causing significant distress or if there is a risk of complications from the atrial fibrillation. Measuring D-Dimer levels may be appropriate if there is suspicion for pulmonary embolism, but this is not supported by the patient\u2019s symptoms or physical exam findings."
