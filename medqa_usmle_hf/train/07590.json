The symptoms suggest that the most likely cause is dementia, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as Alzheimer's disease or thyroid disease. The patient's weight gain suggests hypothyroidism, and thus the most likely result from further evaluation is an elevated serum TSH level. A diffuse cortical atrophy or ventriculomegaly could be seen in Alzheimer's disease, but there is no evidence for it in the question stem. Elevated serum WBC count is not relevant to the patient's symptoms."

The impaired attention and difficulty remembering objects suggest a memory problem, which is a common symptom of Alzheimer's disease. However, since the question asks about further evaluation, we can rule out options A and B, which are imaging studies. Option C, elevated serum WBC count, is not likely related to the patient's symptoms. Option D, elevated serum TSH, is a possible cause of the symptoms, as hypothyroidism can cause cognitive impairment and memory problems. Therefore, further evaluation should include checking the patient's thyroid function."
