Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is produced by the syncytiotrophoblast, which is formed after the blastocyst implants in the endometrium.

By the time the patient's test was positive, enough hCG had been produced to detect the hormone in the urine."

The syncytiotrophoblast is the first structure to form after fertilization and secretes human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This hormone is detected in the blood and urine of pregnant women and the sensitivity of pregnancy tests is based on the amount of hCG present. At 3 weeks gestational age, there may not be enough hCG produced yet to yield a positive result on a pregnancy test. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the negative test is that the syncytiotrophoblast had not yet developed to produce hCG at that time."

The syncytiotrophoblast is responsible for producing human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is the hormone detected by pregnancy tests.

As the estimated gestational age is 4 weeks, it is likely that the syncytiotrophoblast has developed enough to produce detectable levels of hCG. The other options are incorrect as they do not accurately describe the timing and production of hCG during early pregnancy."
