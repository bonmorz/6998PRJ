The cyclic alteration of the QRS axis implies polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which can be caused by a prolonged QT interval. The patient's medications, such as methadone, can also prolong the QT interval. Prinzmetal angina is unlikely since the patient does not have chest pain. Brugada syndrome is also a possibility, but prolonged QT interval is the most likely cause in this case. Hypomagnesemia can also cause prolonged QT interval, but there is no evidence of electrolyte abnormalities in the laboratory results."

The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and takes methadone for chronic pain, which can cause QT interval prolongation. The presence of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis suggests prolonged QT interval as the most likely underlying cause of syncope. Prinzmetal angina is characterized by chest pain due to coronary artery vasospasm, which the patient does not report having. Brugada syndrome is a genetic condition that leads to abnormal heart rhythms and sudden cardiac death, but it typically occurs in younger patients and QT interval prolongation is not a prominent feature. Hypomagnesemia can cause QT interval prolongation, but it typically presents with other symptoms such as muscle weakness or cramping."
