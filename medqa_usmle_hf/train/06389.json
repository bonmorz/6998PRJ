The presentation suggests congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) with deficient steroidogenesis, and the laboratory results show elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels, which is consistent with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The ambiguous genitalia is also a common feature in CAH. Deficiency of 11-beta-hydroxylase can also cause hypertension, but the laboratory results do not match. Deficiency of 17-alpha-hydroxylase will cause hypertension and decreased sex hormones secretion, but the laboratory results suggest increased androgen levels. Deficiency of placental aromatase will not cause CAH."

The infant\u2019s symptoms and laboratory results suggest congenital adrenal hyperplasia caused by deficiency of 21-hydroxylase. This deficiency leads to a decrease in cortisol and aldosterone levels, as well as an increase in androgen levels, which could explain the ambiguous genitalia. The elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels also indicate this deficiency. Deficiency of 11-beta-hydroxylase and 17-alpha-hydroxylase can also cause congenital adrenal hyperplasia, but they present with different hormone imbalances. Deficiency of placental aromatase would not cause these symptoms."

These are classic signs of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase is the most common form of CAH, which leads to excess androgen production causing ambiguous genitalia in females. The elevated serum potassium levels in 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency and hypertension and feminization in 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency could not explain the clinical picture. Deficiency of placental aromatase will affect the production of estrogen in females, but it is not related to CAH."
