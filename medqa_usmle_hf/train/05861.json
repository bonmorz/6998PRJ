Multiple myeloma is unlikely in a 6-year-old patient and is associated with anemia, bone pain, and hypercalcemia. Ewing sarcoma is more commonly seen in the femur or pelvis and may have a mixed appearance on x-ray. Giant-cell tumor of bone may also appear on x-ray as an osteolytic lesion, but is not commonly seen in children."
