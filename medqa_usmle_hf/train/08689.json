The physical examination shows localized tenderness to the right lower quadrant without rebound tenderness or guarding, and laboratory tests show elevated liver enzymes and an elevated C-reactive protein level. Among the options, only carcinoid tumor causes symptoms that match the patient\u2019s presentation, such as abdominal pain, bowel symptoms, flushing, and wheezing. Ascaris lumbricoides infection can cause eosinophilia, but the patient\u2019s eosinophil count is only 2%. Pheochromocytoma would not explain the patient's bowel movements and liver enzyme abnormalities, and inflammatory bowel disease would not explain the sudden palpitations and facial flushing."

The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain and cramping, multiple daily bowel movements, sudden palpitations, and facial flushing, indicating a possible tumor of the gastrointestinal system, specifically a carcinoid tumor. The elevated liver enzymes AST and ALT suggest that there may be liver metastasis. The patient's history of travel to Cambodia also suggests that she may have been exposed to parasitic infections, but the symptom presentation is not consistent with Ascaris lumbricoides infection. Pheochromocytoma may cause sudden palpitations and elevated blood pressure, but it does not explain the patient's other symptoms. Inflammatory bowel disease is a possibility given the patient's symptoms but is less likely given her age and the presence of elevations in liver enzymes."
