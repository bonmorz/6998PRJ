The patient presents with facial drooping, difficulty closing the left eye, and a cranial mass that is compressing an adjacent nerve. The facial nerve (CN VII) controls the muscles of facial expression and innervates the lacrimal gland responsible for tear production. The internal auditory meatus contains two important nerves, CN VII and CN VIII. A tumor compressing CN VII in the internal auditory meatus can cause facial drooping and difficulty closing the left eye, making option (B) the correct answer. The foramen ovale contains CN V, the jugular foramen contains CN IX, X, and XI, and the superior orbital fissure contains CN III, IV, and VI, none of which would directly cause the patient's symptoms."
