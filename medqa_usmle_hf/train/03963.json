The presentation of bilious vomiting and abdominal distention in a newborn with a distended abdomen and hypoactive bowel sounds suggests intestinal obstruction. Among the options, only defective migration of neural crest cells can cause intestinal obstruction, which can present as Hirschsprung disease. This is supported by the empty rectum on digital rectal examination, which is a hallmark of Hirschsprung disease."

The description of bilious vomiting and abdominal distension, along with a radiographic image of a dilated stomach and small bowel loops indicate intestinal obstruction. Defective migration of neural crest cells is the underlying cause of Hirschsprung disease, which is commonly associated with obstructive symptoms in the neonatal period. Disruption of blood flow to the fetal jejunum can cause midgut volvulus, but this typically presents with non-bilious vomiting. Mutation in the CFTR gene is associated with cystic fibrosis, which can cause intestinal obstruction, but this typically presents later in life. Abnormal rotation of the intestine can also lead to intestinal obstruction, but it typically presents earlier in gestation or in the neonatal period."

Abnormal rotation of the intestine would lead to volvulus, which would cause a different pattern of bowel dilation on the x-ray."
