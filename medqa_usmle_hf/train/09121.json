The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest acute pancreatitis, which can be severe if there is evidence of organ failure, including elevated LDH and AST levels. Age is also a risk factor for severity in acute pancreatitis. Therefore, the combination of Age, LDH, and AST would best predict severity in this case. Glucose is elevated but not a specific predictor of severity in acute pancreatitis. WBC and platelet count may suggest inflammation but are not specific, and lipase and amylase levels, although elevated, do not reflect severity."

The patient exhibits classic symptoms of acute pancreatitis, such as abdominal pain that radiates to the back, nausea, and vomiting. Laboratory tests show elevated levels of serum amylase and lipase, indicating pancreatic inflammation. Additionally, the high levels of serum LDH and AST suggest tissue damage. Age is also a significant factor in predicting severity of acute pancreatitis, with older patients being at higher risk for complications. Therefore, option (B) - Age, LDH, AST - would be the best combination to predict severity in this case."
