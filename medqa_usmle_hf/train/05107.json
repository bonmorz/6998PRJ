The primary mechanism of drug which would be prescribed to treat this symptom is 5-HT3 blocker. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are commonly used in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting due to their ability to inhibit the activity of serotonin, which is a major component of nausea and vomiting pathways in the brain."
