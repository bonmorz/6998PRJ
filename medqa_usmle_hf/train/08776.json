Gram-negative non-flagellated bacteria that don't ferment lactose would include E. coli but wouldn't lead to black colonies. Gram-positive aerobic bacteria that produce catalase are catalase-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus, but they usually do not cause bloody diarrhea. Gram-positive aerobic, rod-shaped bacteria that form spores such as Clostridium difficile also may cause diarrhea but typically do not cause bloody stools."
