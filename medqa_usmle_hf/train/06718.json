Type 1 renal tubular acidosis is characterized by low serum potassium, while Type 2 renal tubular acidosis includes normal anion gap metabolic acidosis and low serum bicarbonate.

This suggests type 4 renal tubular acidosis, which is commonly associated with diabetes, hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The enlarged prostate is likely causing obstruction of the urinary tract, leading to retention of urine and accumulation of potassium, in turn causing renal tubular acidosis.

Type 1 RTA involves defects in hydrogen ion secretion and is characterized by hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with a urine pH >5.5. Type 2 RTA is characterized by an inability to reabsorb bicarbonate in the proximal tubule and is characterized by a low serum bicarbonate level and urine pH >5.5.
