Combined with the patient's history of severe pain episodes and alcohol consumption, the most likely cause of the laboratory abnormalities is extravascular hemolysis. Chronic inflammation and folate deficiency can also cause anemia, but are less likely given the patient's history. Ineffective erythropoiesis is not supported by the laboratory findings."

The normal leukocyte count and differential suggest that chronic inflammation is unlikely. Folate deficiency can cause anemia but it does not explain the elevated LDH. The normal reticulocyte count suggests that the anemia is not due to ineffective erythropoiesis. Therefore, the best explanation is extravascular hemolysis, which can be caused by conditions such as sickle cell disease, which is more prevalent in African Americans. The patient's alcohol and tobacco use and poor diet may also contribute to this condition."
