GnRH (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone) is a hormone that stimulates the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. To improve fertility, a medication similar to GnRH can be prescribed to stimulate ovulation. Leuprolide is one such medication. Anastrazole is a medication that blocks the production of estrogen, and is used to treat breast cancer. Clomiphene is a medication that induces ovulation, but it works by blocking the action of estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, which then results in an increase in FSH and LH levels. Mestranol is an estrogen medication that is rarely used in fertility treatment today."

GnRH stands for gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and the medication prescribed to the patient in this scenario is similar to GnRH. Leuprolide is a medication that works by suppressing the production of gonadotropins, which leads to a decrease in estrogen and testosterone levels. This can be useful for treating infertility by regulating ovulation. Anastrazole is an aromatase inhibitor used to treat breast cancer, Clomiphene is used for ovulation induction in women who do not ovulate regularly, and Mestranol is an estrogen replacement therapy that is no longer available in the United States."
