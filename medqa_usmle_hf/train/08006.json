Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist, which means it blocks the constriction of blood vessels and leads to vasodilation.

Option C is incorrect because it lists bronchial constriction instead of relaxation, and decreased heart rate instead of no effect or slight increase. Option D is incorrect because it lists increased peristalsis instead of bladder relaxation."
