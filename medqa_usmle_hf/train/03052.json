The patient's recent consumption of seafood and location in Louisiana suggests that Vibrio vulnificus is the most likely cause of the symptoms.

Listeria monocytogenes is more commonly associated with ingestion of contaminated dairy products or deli meats. Shigella dysenteriae is more commonly associated with poor sanitation in developing countries."
