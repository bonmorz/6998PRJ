Total thyroidectomy is an appropriate next step in management. Radioiodine therapy may be used after surgery to ablate any remaining thyroid tissue, but it is not the next step in management. Observation and follow-up in 3 months is not appropriate, as the nodule is suspicious for cancer. Thyroid scintigraphy is not necessary, as the diagnosis of cancer has already been established by the biopsy."
