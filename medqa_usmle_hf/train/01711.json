Infiltration with eosinophils is seen in eosinophilic myocarditis, which is rare. Infiltration with neutrophils is seen in acute bacterial or fungal myocarditis, which is also rare. Infiltration with granulomas is seen in sarcoidosis-associated myocarditis, which typically presents with less severe symptoms and a more chronic course."
