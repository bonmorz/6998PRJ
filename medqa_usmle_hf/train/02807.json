It is important to communicate this information to the patient and schedule follow-up appointments with a specialist. Response A is partially correct, as confirmation testing will be needed, but it does not address the question about AIDS. Response B is incorrect as HIV can be transmitted from the first sexual encounter. Response C is misleading as while treatment can manage the symptoms of AIDS, there is still no cure for HIV infection."

The question is asking for the most accurate response, and the only accurate response is (D) because a positive HIV test does not automatically mean that the person has AIDS. Further bloodwork and testing are needed to determine the stage of the infection and the need for treatment. Option (A) is partly correct in that a confirmatory test is needed but it is not solely for determining AIDS. Option (B) is incorrect and potentially harmful because it implies that a recent start of sexual activity makes one immune from HIV. Option (C) is incorrect because while HIV is now a manageable condition with medication, AIDS is still a serious and potentially life-threatening complication of HIV."
