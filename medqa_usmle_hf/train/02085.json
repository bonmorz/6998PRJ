The patient displays symptoms of Parkinson disease with dementia, including short-term memory deficits, confusion, and visual hallucinations. This suggests that Lewy body deposition is the most likely underlying cause, given that it is a hallmark of Parkinson disease with dementia. Vascular infarcts can cause dementia but do not typically present with Parkinsonian symptoms. Frontotemporal lobe atrophy can also cause dementia but does not typically present with motor symptoms. Thiamine deficiency can cause dementia, but it typically presents with other physical symptoms such as nystagmus and ataxia."
