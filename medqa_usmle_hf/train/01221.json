Option B shows improvement in CD4+ T lymphocyte count but the HIV viral load is not decreasing. Option C is the correct answer as it shows an increase in CD4+ T lymphocyte count and decrease in HIV viral load, but the HIV antibody test is still positive indicating the patient is still HIV positive."

The treatment regimen prescribed is effective against the virus. Three months later, follow-up laboratory findings would most likely show an increase in CD4+ T count and a decrease in HIV RNA levels (represented by an increase in the percent of CD4+/CD8+ ratio and a decrease in HIV RNA in option C). The HIV antibody test would still be positive as it indicates past or current infection. Option A is unlikely as it shows a decrease in both CD4+/CD8+ ratio and HIV RNA, which would suggest treatment failure. Option B shows an increase in both CD4+/CD8+ ratio and HIV RNA, which would be unexpected with effective treatment. Option D represents continued immunosuppression and no response to treatment."
