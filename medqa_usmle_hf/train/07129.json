The patient's heavy training as a competitive runner suggests that her body fat may be low, leading to decreased frequency of GnRH release from the hypothalamus, which can cause amenorrhea. Increased prolactin secretion can also cause amenorrhea, but there are no symptoms suggesting this in the patient's case. Intrauterine adhesions can cause secondary amenorrhea, but the patient has no history of uterine surgery or infection. Increased LH release and increased ovarian androgen production are seen in polycystic ovary syndrome, but the patient has no symptoms suggestive of this condition."

The patient\u2019s lack of menstrual period and heavy physical training suggest that the most likely cause of her amenorrhea is decreased frequency of GnRH release from the hypothalamus. Physical stress on the body can cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which affects GnRH release and ultimately leads to decreased estrogen levels and amenorrhea. Increased prolactin secretion and increased ovarian androgen production would lead to other symptoms such as galactorrhea and hirsutism, respectively, neither of which are mentioned in the scenario. Intrauterine adhesions would cause amenorrhea only if there was a history of uterine surgery or infection, which is not described in the scenario."
