The x-ray shows degenerative changes in the knee joint consistent with osteoarthritis. Weight loss program is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient as it can reduce the stress on the knee joint and improve symptoms. Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections are a treatment option but should be reserved for cases not responding to conservative measures. Total joint replacement is also an option for severe cases, but the patient's symptoms do not warrant this drastic treatment yet. Colchicine therapy is used in the treatment of gout, not osteoarthritis."

The limited range of motion and crepitus in the knee suggest knee osteoarthritis. Weight loss can improve knee pain and slow the progression of osteoarthritis. Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections and total joint replacement are potential treatments for osteoarthritis, but weight loss should be attempted first.
