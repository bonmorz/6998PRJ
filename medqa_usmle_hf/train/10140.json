The patient's low hemoglobin, conjunctival pallor, and splenomegaly suggest a diagnosis of anemia. The presence of echinocytes and rigid red blood cells suggest a possible diagnosis of a hemoglobinopathy such as sickle cell anemia, which is known to cause rigidity in red blood cells leading to vaso-occlusive crisis and tissue ischemia. Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, making option (A) the correct answer. Information about X-linked dominant, X-linked recessive, and mitochondrial inheritance is not relevant to this diagnosis."

Among the options, only autosomal recessive inheritance is likely to result in a symmetrical condition in which both parents are carriers of a gene defect that leads to the condition. X-linked dominant and X-linked recessive inheritance requires more specific patterns of inheritance and are less likely. Mitochondrial inheritance is a rare mode of inheritance for hemolytic anemias."
