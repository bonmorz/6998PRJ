The patient\u2019s symptoms and positive viral culture suggest that he has influenza, which is caused by an orthomyxovirus. Pandemics of influenzas typically involve a reassortment of viral genes from different strains of influenza, leading to the emergence of a new strain that can be more virulent and easily transmitted between humans. Therefore, the correct answer is reassortment. Complementation, recombination, and transduction are other mechanisms by which viruses can exchange genetic material, but they are not typically involved in the emergence of new pandemic strains of influenza."

The fact that the disease is caused by an orthomyxovirus and occurred in a previous year suggests that the disease is influenza. The mechanism responsible for pandemics of influenza is reassortment, where two different strains of the virus infect the same host and exchange genetic material, creating a new strain that can cause a pandemic. Complementation refers to the phenomenon where one individual has two different mutations in two different genes, but the combined function of both mutations still allows for normal function. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two different DNA molecules, such as during meiosis. Transduction is the transfer of genetic material from one bacterial cell to another via bacteriophage. None of these mechanisms are responsible for influenza pandemics."
