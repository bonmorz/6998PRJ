The CT scan shows a filling defect in the renal vein, suggesting renal vein thrombosis. Loss of antithrombin III, which is a natural anticoagulant, is the most common cause of renal vein thrombosis. Factor V Leiden is another genetic predisposition for thrombosis but doesn\u2019t have an association with nephrotic syndrome. Increased lipoprotein synthesis and malignant erythropoietin production are not related to the symptoms."
