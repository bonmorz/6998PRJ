Dilation of both ventricles will cause a dilated cardiomyopathy which will present with a systolic murmur. Fusion of mitral valve leaflets is mitral valve prolapse which presents with a systolic click and later-systolic murmur. Right bundle branch block will not cause any mitral valve-related sounds."
