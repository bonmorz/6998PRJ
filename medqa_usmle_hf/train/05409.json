The initial test that would indicate a possible diagnosis is Serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). GH stimulates the production of IGF-1, and high levels of IGF-1 can indicate excess GH secretion. Pituitary MRI, glucose suppression test, and chest X-ray may also be useful, but Serum insulin-like growth factor-1 is the most targeted and specific initial test for acromegaly."
