While each state may have different laws regarding the hierarchy of surrogate decision-makers, in general, the patient's spouse or adult children take priority over parents or siblings. In this case, since the patient did not have a spouse, the patient's adult child (the 22-year-old daughter) would likely be the most appropriate surrogate decision-maker. The patient's girlfriend of 12 years may not have legal authority, depending on the state's laws regarding common law marriage. The patient's mother or older brother may be considered if the patient did not have any adult children."

In this case, the patient's girlfriend of 12 years would not qualify as a spouse, and the patient's mother and older brother would come after the patient's adult daughter. Therefore, (C) the patient's 22-year-old daughter is the most appropriate choice for surrogate decision maker."
