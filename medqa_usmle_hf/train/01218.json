Loop diuretics function by inhibiting the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the kidney, leading to increased urine production and decreased edema. Option A is the correct statement. Loop diuretics do not cause ammonia toxicity or metabolic acidosis, but they can cause hyperuricemia and hyperglycemia. Hyperlipidemia is not a commonly reported side effect of loop diuretics."
