Mitral annular dilatation is a common cause of S3 gallop and holosystolic murmurs, often seen in postpartum women due to changes in the heart size and cardiac function during pregnancy. Myxomatous mitral valve degeneration is another common cause of systolic murmurs, but it typically does not cause an S3 gallop. Mitral valve leaflet fibrosis and mitral annular calcification are also causes of mitral regurgitation, but they present with different symptoms and signs."
