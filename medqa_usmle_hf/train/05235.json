Acid-fast bacilli seen on blood smear also indicate tuberculosis. Decreased IFN-\u03b3 levels are typically seen in patients with active tuberculosis. The other options are not associated with tuberculosis. A mutation in WAS gene causes Wiskott\u2013Aldrich syndrome, a rare genetic disorder with symptoms such as bleeding disorders and immune deficiency. Absent B cells with normal T cell count suggests X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Decreased T-cell receptor excision circles on PCR suggests severe combined immunodeficiency."
