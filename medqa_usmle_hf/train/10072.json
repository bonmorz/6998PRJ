The symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloody stools, and distended abdomen with absent bowel sounds, suggest ischemic colitis. The patient\u2019s risk factors (previous surgery, hypertension, smoking, vasopressor use) increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. Postoperative ileus would not cause bloody stools, and pseudomembranous colitis is typically associated with recent antibiotic use. Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture would cause severe and sudden onset of pain, not crampy pain several days postoperatively."

Pseudomembranous colitis would have presented earlier and with more diarrhea, and the x-ray would not show air-filled distended bowel. Postoperative ileus would not explain the bloody stools or the tenderness on palpation.

The patient's symptoms suggest the most likely diagnosis is ischemic colitis, which can occur as a complication of the surgery and the patient's risk factors. The bloody stools suggest a gastrointestinal issue, and the distended abdomen and absent bowel sounds indicate an obstruction. Pseudomembranous colitis is also a possibility given the patient's recent antibiotic use, but the absence of diarrhea makes it less likely. Postoperative ileus would not cause bloody stools or distention. Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture would present with different symptoms such as sudden and severe abdominal pain, hypotension, and signs of shock."

The presence of loose, bloody stools and abdominal pain also suggest ischemic colitis. The distended abdomen with absent bowel sounds and tenderness to palpation in all quadrants are also consistent with this diagnosis. The fact that the patient underwent open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is a red herring as the symptoms are not consistent with an aneurysm rupture. Postoperative ileus is less likely given the presence of bloody stools and the fact that the symptoms developed several days after surgery. Pseudomembranous colitis is a potential complication of antibiotic use, but in this case, the patient received prophylactic cefazolin which is not typically associated with this complication."
