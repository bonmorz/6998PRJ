The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is common among smokers and diabetic patients. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the best initial step in diagnosing PAD, as it is a noninvasive and inexpensive test that is widely available. Arteriography may be considered if ABI is abnormal and intervention is necessary, but it is a more invasive procedure with potential risks. Aspirin and atorvastatin may be used for management of PAD, but testing and diagnosis should come first."
