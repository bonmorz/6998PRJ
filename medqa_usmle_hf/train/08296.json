Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine which binds to the GABAA receptor, causing allosteric activation of the receptor and increasing the affinity of GABA to the receptor. This promotes chloride influx into the neuron, leading to hyperpolarization and suppression of neuronal activity. The inhibition of GABA transaminase is a mechanism of action for drugs used to treat epileptic seizures, but not for lorazepam."

Lorazepam enhances the effect of GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, by binding to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. This binding enhances the chloride ion flux through the receptor, leading to increased membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of neuronal excitability. This is an example of allosteric activation of the GABAA receptor."

Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that acts as an allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, leading to increased chloride ion influx and hyperpolarization of the neuron, ultimately resulting in sedative and anticonvulsant effects. Therefore, option (B) is correct. The other options are not correct because GABAB receptors are not affected by lorazepam, chloride channel opening is not increased by lorazepam, and GABA transaminase is not directly inhibited by lorazepam."

Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that acts on GABAA receptors, binding to a specific site on the alpha subunit of the receptor. This results in an allosteric activation of the receptor, leading to increased chloride ion influx and hyperpolarization of the neuron. This helps to terminate seizure activity and is the reason why lorazepam is used to treat seizures. Option A is incorrect because lorazepam binds to GABAA, not GABAB, receptors. Option C is incorrect because lorazepam does not affect the duration of chloride channel opening. Option D is incorrect because GABA transaminase is not involved in the mechanism of action of lorazepam."
