Based on the symptoms and the chest x-ray, the most likely cause of the newborn's respiratory distress is surfactant deficiency, which is commonly seen in premature infants. This can lead to decreased lung compliance and increased work of breathing, causing symptoms like nasal flaring, grunting, and tachypnea. The other options are less likely causes and not supported by the given information."
