The symptoms and physical examination findings suggest adrenal insufficiency, and among the options, only autoimmune destruction of the adrenal gland (also known as Addison's disease) can cause these symptoms. Low adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion from the pituitary gland or low corticotropin-releasing hormone secretion from the hypothalamus can also cause adrenal insufficiency, but they would not lead to thyroid and skin findings. Increased iron absorption and deposition in the body is associated with hemochromatosis, which would not explain the patient's symptoms."
