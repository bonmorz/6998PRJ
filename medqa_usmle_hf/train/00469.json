The optimal treatment for pheochromocytoma is surgical removal of the tumor. Prior to surgery, noncompetitive alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers such as phenoxybenzamine should be administered to prevent hypertensive crises during surgery. Isoproterenol is a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist used to treat bradycardia and heart block. Propranolol is a beta-blocker used to lower blood pressure and treat conditions such as angina and migraines. Phentolamine is a competitive alpha-blocker used for other conditions such as Raynaud's syndrome and erectile dysfunction."

Isoproterenol and propranolol are beta-blockers that can worsen hypertension in patients with pheochromocytoma.

The presentation of severe headaches, flushing, and high blood pressure suggests a possible pheochromocytoma, which is a tumor on the adrenal gland that produces excess catecholamines. Phenoxybenzamine is a noncompetitive alpha-adrenergic antagonist used to manage hypertension caused by pheochromocytoma. Therefore, prior to surgery, phenoxybenzamine should be administered to block the effects of excess catecholamines released during surgery, which can lead to hypertensive crisis. Isoproterenol and propranolol are beta-adrenergic agonist and antagonist, respectively, and are not used to manage hypertension caused by pheochromocytoma. Phentolamine is a competitive alpha-blocker and may be used in emergencies to address hypertensive crisis caused by pheochromocytoma, but it is not the optimal treatment prior to surgery."

The symptoms of severe headaches and flushing suggest pheochromocytoma, which causes excessive production of catecholamines causing periodic symptoms. The blood pressure of 175 mmHg/100 mmHg also indicates hypertension. As pheochromocytoma causes catecholamine secretion, the most appropriate noncompetitive inhibitor to be administered prior to surgery is Phenoxybenzamine, which blocks the actions of norepinephrine and epinephrine on both alpha and beta receptors."

The optimal treatment for this condition is surgery, but prior to surgery, phenoxybenzamine, a noncompetitive inhibitor of alpha-adrenergic receptors, should be administered to prevent hypertensive crisis. Therefore, the correct answer is (D). Isoproterenol is a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist and is not used in the treatment of pheochromocytoma. Propranolol is a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker and should not be used in the treatment of pheochromocytoma since it can cause unopposed alpha-adrenergic activity leading to hypertensive crisis. Phentolamine is a competitive inhibitor of alpha-adrenergic receptors and can be used to treat hypertensive crisis caused by pheochromocytoma, but it does not block the sustained vasoconstriction caused by catecholamines like phenoxybenzamine does."
