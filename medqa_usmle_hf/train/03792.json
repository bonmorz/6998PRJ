At a low concentration of glucose and absence of lactose, cAMP levels increase, which leads to binding of cAMP to the catabolite activator protein (CAP). This complex then binds to the promoter region of the lac operon, which stimulates transcription of the lac Z, Y, and A genes. The repressor remains bound to the operator, preventing transcription, until lactose is present and binds to the repressor, causing it to release and allow transcription to proceed. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer."

However, the accumulation of cAMP due to low glucose levels results in binding to the catabolite activator protein (CAP), which then activates transcription of the lac operon. This leads to increased transcription of the lac Z, Y, and A genes, which are responsible for lactose metabolism. The lac repressor protein remains bound to the operator region until lactose is present, at which point it releases and allows for transcription. Therefore, the correct answer is option (A): Increased cAMP levels result in binding to the catabolite activator protein."

When there is a low concentration of glucose and no lactose, there is a low level of cAMP and the catabolite activator protein (CAP) has poor binding, resulting in inhibition of transcription. When glucose is low and lactose is present, cAMP levels increase and bind to CAP, which can then bind to the promoter region and activate transcription of the lac Z, Y, and A genes. The lac repressor is only released when lactose is present and it binds to the repressor, preventing it from binding to the operator."

In the absence of lactose, the repressor protein binds to the operator region, preventing transcription of the lac operon.
