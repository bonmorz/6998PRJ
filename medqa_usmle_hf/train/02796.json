The symptoms of fever and oliguria, as well as the presence of eosinophils in both blood and urine, suggest a hypersensitivity reaction. Rifampin is known to be associated with a hypersensitivity reaction that can cause fever, rash, eosinophilia, and acute kidney injury. The other medications are less commonly associated with hypersensitivity reactions. The option of non-compliance with the anti-TB regimen would not explain the sudden onset of symptoms."

The sudden onset of fever and oliguria, along with the presence of eosinophils, suggests that the patient is experiencing either drug-induced hypersensitivity or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) due to the anti-tuberculosis medication. Rifampin is the most common drug associated with these reactions. Isoniazid and ethambutol are less commonly associated with these symptoms, and the return of active tuberculosis symptoms due to non-compliance is unlikely given that the patient is undergoing standard therapy for an active infection."
