The patient\u2019s symptoms, medical history, and physical examination suggest peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is typically caused by narrowing and calcification of vessels. Decreased permeability of endothelium may cause edema, but it doesn\u2019t cause the characteristic symptoms of PAD. Peripheral emboli can cause sudden pain and loss of function, which is not consistent with the patient\u2019s presentation. Weakening of vessel wall may cause aneurysms or bleeding, but it\u2019s not a common cause of PAD."
