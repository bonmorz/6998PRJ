The symptoms and history of injection drug use and previous infective endocarditis are concerning for infective endocarditis again, which can cause aortic regurgitation. Widened pulse pressure is a classic sign of aortic regurgitation, as the aortic valve is not closing properly and allows blood to leak back into the left ventricle during diastole. A mid-systolic click is heard in mitral valve prolapse, a venous hum is heard in vascular abnormalities, and a systolic murmur that increases with valsalva is heard in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
