Since the patient has no expectoration, chest pain, or breathlessness, the cough suppressant should be used to control the cough itself. Among the options, dextromethorphan is the best choice as it is a non-opioid antitussive that works by inhibiting cough reflex in the central nervous system. Codeine is also a cough suppressant, but it can cause respiratory depression and sedation. Pseudoephedrine and oxymetazoline are decongestants and do not work directly on cough suppression."
