The presence of several hundred pigmented lesions suggests the patient has multiple nevi or moles, which are a risk factor for melanoma, a malignant tumor. S100 protein is expressed in melanocytes, and its presence in epithelioid cells with fine granules is a key diagnostic feature of melanoma. Atypical keratinocytes forming keratin pearls are characteristic of squamous cell carcinoma. Mucin-filled cells with peripheral nuclei and pale, round cells with palisading nuclei are associated with mucinous and basal cell carcinomas, respectively."
