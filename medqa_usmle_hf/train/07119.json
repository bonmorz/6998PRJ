The insertion of four bases (TATC) into exon 11 and the decreased activity of hexosaminidase A suggest a frameshift mutation, where the insertion or deletion of nucleotides disrupts the reading frame of the genetic code, causing a shift in how the codons are read. This results in a truncated protein or no protein being produced, leading to the symptoms observed in this infant."

The insertion of four bases (TATC) into exon 11 indicates a frameshift mutation, in which the reading frame of the genetic code is shifted, resulting in a completely different amino acid sequence. This frameshift mutation leads to decreased activity of hexosaminidase A, which is the cause of the symptoms. The other options do not involve a change in the reading frame and thus would not be the best explanation for these findings."

The insertion of four bases into exon 11 would result in a frameshift mutation, which alters the reading frame of the gene and causes a truncated, nonfunctional protein. This is consistent with the decreased activity of hexosaminidase A, which is characteristic of Tay-Sachs disease. The hypotonia and increased startle response are also consistent with this diagnosis. Missense mutations change a single amino acid and may or may not be deleterious. Nonsense mutations introduce a premature stop codon and can also result in a truncated, nonfunctional protein. Silent mutations do not change the amino acid sequence and are usually neutral."

Mutations in the HEXA gene that result in a frameshift, like an insertion of four bases as described in the question, can cause Tay-Sachs disease, which involves decreased activity of hexosaminidase A, and presents with hypotonia, increased startle response, and progressive neurological deterioration in the first year of life. Missense, nonsense, or silent mutations would not cause such a significant disruption to the function of the HEXA gene."
