The palpable mass on the posterior aspect of the left knee supports this diagnosis. Osteochondromas are associated with type IV hypersensitivity reactions. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). Herniated nucleus pulposus is associated with lower back pain and radicular pain down one or both legs. Inflammation of the pes anserine bursa is associated with medial knee pain. Venous valve failure causes varicose veins and edema."

The palpable mass over the posterior aspect of the left knee and its hypoechoic nature on ultrasound suggest a Baker's cyst. Baker's cyst is often a result of joint inflammation, which is associated with Type IV hypersensitivity reactions. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. Herniated nucleus pulposus and inflammation of the pes anserine bursa are not associated with this condition. Venous valve failure may lead to swelling but is not likely to result in a palpable mass."

The non-pulsatile, non-erythematous, palpable mass over the posterior aspect of her left knee that is roughly 3 to 4 cm in diameter and is hypoechoic on ultrasound suggests a Baker\u2019s cyst. Baker\u2019s cyst is associated with Type IV hypersensitivity, which means a cell-mediated response, and not antibody-mediated response. Herniated nucleus pulposus causes lower back pain, inflammation of the pes anserine bursa causes pain medially at the knee joint, and venous valve failure causes varicose veins."

The main symptom of the patient is knee pain that improves with use, and there is a palpable mass at the posterior aspect of the left knee. These findings are associated with Baker's cyst, which is a result of joint inflammation and fluid accumulation. Type IV hypersensitivity is a cell-mediated immune response that can occur in response to joint inflammation and may contribute to the formation of Baker's cyst. Herniated nucleus pulposus is associated with back pain, while inflammation of the pes anserine bursa is associated with medial knee pain. Venous valve failure is associated with venous insufficiency and can result in lower extremity swelling and pain, but it is not directly related to Baker's cyst."
