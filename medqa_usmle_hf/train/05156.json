The migration of neural crest cells is crucial for the proper development of structures derived from embryonic ectoderm, such as the nervous system and heart. Pulmonic stenosis is a congenital heart defect caused by the failure of neural crest cells to form the pulmonary valve correctly, leading to a narrowing of the pulmonary artery. Symptoms include a harsh, systolic ejection murmur and cyanosis, which is consistent with the infant's presentation. Atrial septal defect and coarctation of the aorta are not specifically related to neural crest cell migration. Transposition of the great vessels also involves abnormal development of the heart, but does not involve neural crest cells."
