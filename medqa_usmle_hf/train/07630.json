Availability bias occurs when a clinician relies on easily available information or an easily remembered diagnosis to the exclusion of less common diagnoses. In this case, the physician's recent experience with patients with the common cold led to an assumption of viral upper respiratory tract infection, causing the physician to overlook the possibility of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Confirmation bias occurs when a clinician seeks evidence to support an initial diagnosis rather than considering alternative possibilities. Anchoring bias occurs when a clinician becomes fixed on initial impressions or data, failing to adjust their thinking as more data becomes available. Framing bias occurs when the way information is presented or framed affects decision-making.  None of these biases accurately describe the cognitive bias in this scenario."

The physician's failure to consider an alternative diagnosis despite the patient\u2019s symptoms suggests availability bias, where the physician relied too heavily on recent experiences with patients who had similar symptoms, overlooking other possible diagnoses. Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, and favor information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. Anchoring bias is the tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making decisions. Framing bias is the effect that the way information is presented can influence judgment and decision-making."
