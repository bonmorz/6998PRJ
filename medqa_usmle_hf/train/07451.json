The high pressure at the lower esophageal sphincter in conjunction with the patient's history and ethnicity suggest that the most likely etiology is Trypanosoma cruzi infection, also known as Chagas disease. This disease can cause megaesophagus and mega colon, leading to difficulty swallowing and weight loss. Malignant proliferation of squamous cells can cause esophageal cancer, but this is less likely given the patient's young age and lack of risk factors. Food allergy and pyloric stenosis are also not likely causes of the patient's symptoms."
