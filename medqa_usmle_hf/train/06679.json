The patient's decreased breath sounds and decreased fremitus, along with the x-ray showing a collapse of the bases of both lungs, suggest that the most likely underlying mechanism of the hypoxemia is a decreased ratio of ventilated alveoli. This means that although air is being breathed in, it is not reaching the alveoli where gas exchange can occur. This can lead to decreased oxygen saturation in the blood. Increased anatomic dead space refers to areas where air is stagnant and does not participate in gas exchange, and increased tidal volume and decreased chest wall compliance are not suggested by the given information."
