However, the ferritin level is high, which typically indicates iron overload. Beta-thalassemia is a genetic disorder that results in the decreased production of hemoglobin, which can cause microcytic anemia. The patient's ethnic background as an immigrant also increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, and the reticulocyte count is normal, which rules out Hemolytic anemia. The other options, B12 deficiency and Iron deficiency, both have low ferritin levels."

The low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels along with high ferritin are suggestive of beta-thalassemia. B12 deficiency and hemolytic anemia would have normal or high MCV levels. Iron deficiency would have a low ferritin level. The patient's alcohol intake can also be a contributing factor to low hemoglobin levels. However, in this case, beta-thalassemia is the most likely diagnosis."

The high ferritin level rules out iron deficiency as a cause of the anemia. The low reticulocyte count suggests an issue with erythropoiesis.
