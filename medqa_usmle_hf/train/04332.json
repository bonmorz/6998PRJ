Option C suggests switching to a different medication altogether, which is not necessary if the patient is responding well to lithium. Option D is not recommended since stopping lithium can increase the risk of relapse."

Option D is incorrect because the patient\u2019s previous history shows a pattern of manic episodes, and discontinuing lithium would increase the risk of relapse."
