Wedge-shaped prisms in the urine are uric acid crystals. Chlorthalidone is a diuretic that can help prevent formation of kidney stones by increasing urine volume and decreasing the concentration of substances that can form stones. A low-potassium diet would not be helpful in this case. Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid is an antibiotic that would not be effective in treating kidney stones. Allopurinol is used to treat gout, which is caused by excess uric acid in the body, but it would not be effective in treating kidney stones."
