The continuous, dark, vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain, along with a tender abdomen and hypertonic contractions suggest placental detachment as the cause of fetal compromise.

The symptoms and the history suggest placental abruption, where the placenta detaches from the uterine wall, causing vaginal bleeding and putting the fetus at risk of deprivation of oxygen and nutrients.
