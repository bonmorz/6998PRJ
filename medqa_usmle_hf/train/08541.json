The relative risk is the ratio of the incidence of the outcome of interest (cardiomyopathy) in the exposed group to the incidence of the outcome of interest in the unexposed group. In this case, the incidence of cardiomyopathy in the exposed group is 13/52 = 0.25, and the incidence in the unexposed group is 1/50 = 0.02. Therefore, the relative risk is 0.25/0.02 = 12.5, which corresponds to option (A). This means that the mice exposed to the drug are 12.5 times more likely to develop dilated cardiomyopathy compared to mice not exposed to the drug."

Plugging in the values, we get [(13/52)/(39/52)]/[(1/50)/(49/50)] = (0.25/0.75)/(0.02/0.98) = 0.33/0.02 = 16.5. However, we need to round the answer to one decimal point because only one mouse in the unexposed group had cardiomyopathy, which is a small number. Therefore, the answer is (A) 12.5. This means that mice exposed to the drug are 12.5 times more likely to develop dilated cardiomyopathy compared to mice who were not exposed to the drug."
