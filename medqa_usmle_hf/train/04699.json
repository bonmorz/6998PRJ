Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane that surrounds the cell wall, called the outer membrane, which contains lipopolysaccharides (LPS) endotoxin. However, the missing option here is the K capsule, which is a structure outside the cell wall of certain bacteria that helps prevent phagocytosis by immune cells. K capsule is a virulence factor that protects bacteria from the host immune system and allows them to enter the spinal fluid and cause an infection in the brain or spinal cord."
