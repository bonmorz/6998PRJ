The symptoms usually resolve within 10 days to 2 weeks without specific treatment. Postpartum depression (option B) lasts longer than 2 weeks and can have more severe symptoms, while postpartum psychosis (option D) is a rare, but serious, medical emergency that requires treatment with antipsychotics, lithium, and/or antidepressants. Option C is incorrect because the patient did not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode."
