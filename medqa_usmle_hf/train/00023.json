The patient's symptoms are most suggestive of delirium tremens, which is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can occur in patients with a history of alcohol use disorder. The patient's tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, sweating, and agitation are all common symptoms of delirium tremens. Acute cholangitis and hepatic encephalopathy would be less likely given the patient's recent cholecystectomy, and there is no indication of alcohol use in the question stem, making alcoholic hallucinosis less likely as well."
