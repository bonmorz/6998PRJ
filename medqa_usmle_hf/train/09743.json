The kyphotic deformation of the thorax can contribute to reduced lung expansion and ventilation, leading to collapsed alveoli. The bilateral infiltrates on the chest x-ray support this diagnosis. None of the other options listed are as likely to cause the patient's symptoms, as they do not align with the physical examination and radiographic findings."

The patient's symptoms present as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by bilateral fluffy infiltrates seen on chest x-ray and collapsed alveoli. This could be due to the patient's scoliosis and kyphotic deformation of the thorax, which may have compromised lung function during surgery and led to the development of ARDS postoperatively.
