The patient has symptoms of fatigue, hyperpigmented skin, and liver enlargement, which are consistent with hemochromatosis. The elevated iron studies support this possibility. The most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis would be genetic testing, as up to 90% of patients with hemochromatosis carry the HFE gene mutations. CT and ultrasonography may show liver abnormalities but are not specific for hemochromatosis. Liver biopsy may be used to confirm the diagnosis but is invasive and carries risks of bleeding and infection, and genetic testing is a less invasive option."
