The patient\u2019s past medical history is significant for HIV infection and long-standing mild intermittent asthma, which suggests that the most likely cause of her condition is related to her HIV medication. Alcohol use is a known risk factor for acute pancreatitis but it is not the most likely cause in this case given the patient\u2019s BMI and moderate use. Metformin is unlikely to cause acute pancreatitis. Congenital anomalies of the pancreas are rare causes of acute pancreatitis."

The elevated serum amylase and lipase levels support the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. HIV medications have been associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis, making it the most likely cause in this patient. Metformin is not known to cause pancreatitis.
