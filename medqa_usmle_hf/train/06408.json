The perspicacious undergraduate is alluding to the Hawthorne effect, which is a type of observer bias where study participants modify their behavior due to their awareness of being monitored or studied. In this case, the treatment group may exercise harder or longer because they know their exercise can be observed. Selection bias refers to a bias that arises from differences in the selection of participants between the treatment and control groups. Recall bias refers to a bias in which study participants inaccurately recall information about their past behaviors or exposures. Lead time bias refers to a bias that arises when one group is diagnosed earlier than another group despite having the same duration of disease, leading to an apparent increased survival time in the early diagnosed group."

The undergraduate is alluding to the Hawthorne effect, which is a type of bias that occurs when participants modify their behavior in response to being observed or studied. It is possible that participants in the treatment group may try harder or longer to exercise since they know they are being studied and observed. This effect could skew the results of the study. Selection bias occurs when there is a systematic difference in the characteristics between the treatment and control groups. Recall bias occurs when there is a difference in how participants remember or report information between the treatment and control groups. Lead time bias occurs when early detection of a disease makes it seem like the treatment is more effective, even though it just increases the time between diagnosis and death."
