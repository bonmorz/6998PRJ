The staring, lip smacking and clapping of hands are typical of this type of seizure. The confusion and memory problems that follow the episodes are also consistent with complex partial seizures. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures are characterized by convulsions and loss of consciousness. Absence seizures are brief, usually less than 15 seconds and characterized by a loss of awareness. Syncopal episodes are caused by a temporary lack of blood flow to the brain, resulting in loss of consciousness and collapsing. None of the symptoms suggest syncopal episodes."
