The patient presents with a subdural hematoma, which can cause increased intracranial pressure and decreased cerebral blood flow. Hyperventilation helps to reduce cerebral blood flow by decreasing carbon dioxide levels in the blood, which leads to vasoconstriction in the cerebral arteries. Decompressive craniectomy is used in severe cases of elevated intracranial pressure. Lumbar puncture is not indicated in this situation and can be contraindicated due to the risk of brain herniation. Intravenous mannitol can reduce cerebral edema but does not directly affect cerebral blood flow."
