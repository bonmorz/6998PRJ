The patient likely has acute non-specific low back pain, which can be managed with NSAIDs and activity as tolerated. Bed rest is not recommended as it can delay recovery. The use of opioids like oxycodone is not recommended as first-line management for acute low back pain. An MRI of the spine is not indicated at this time as the patient's symptoms suggest acute non-specific low back pain and the benefits and risks of imaging need to be weighed carefully."
