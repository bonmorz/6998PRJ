The presentation, including the step-off palpated over the cervical spine and the unconscious state of the patient, suggests a possible cervical spine injury. Rapid sequence intubation should be done to protect the airway and prevent further injury while imaging is obtained. CT scan of the spine or X-ray of the cervical spine may be done following stabilization, but the priority is ensuring airway and spinal stability. Rectal tone assessment is not a priority in this situation."

The presentation suggests a potential spinal cord injury, and the patient is also unconscious with sluggish pupil reaction, indicating potential intracranial injury. Rapid sequence intubation is the most appropriate next step to stabilize the patient's airway and manage any potential cervical spine injury while obtaining further imaging studies. CT scan of the spine or X-ray of the cervical spine may be ordered after stabilizing the patient, and assessment of rectal tone may also be done to assess for neurologic deficits."
