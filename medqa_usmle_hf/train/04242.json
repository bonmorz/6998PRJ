The laceration of the femoral artery and profuse bleeding suggest the patient may have received blood transfusions, which can lead to a decrease in calcium levels. The adducted thumb, extended fingers, and flexed metacarpophalangeal joints and wrists are signs of acute carpopedal spasm seen in hypocalcemia. Tapping on the cheeks leads to contraction of the facial muscles due to Chvostek's sign, which is also seen in hypocalcemia. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation."
