The lesion looks like a shiny, pearly bump with telangiectasia on the surface, which are characteristics of basal cell carcinoma. Molluscum contagiosum typically presents as small, dome-shaped, pearly papules. Keratoacanthoma appears as a firm, dome-shaped nodule with central ulceration. Actinic keratosis usually appears as rough, scaly patches on sun-exposed areas of the skin."

The patient's history of sun exposure and smoking also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection that presents with small, raised, wart-like lesions. Keratoacanthoma is a dome-shaped lesion with a central crater that grows rapidly over several weeks, then eventually regresses. Actinic keratosis presents as scaly or crusty patches on the skin and can be a precursor to squamous cell carcinoma."

The lesion has characteristics of basal cell carcinoma, including a pearly, translucent appearance with a rolled border, and slow growth over several months. The patient\u2019s history of sun exposure as a farmer and smoking history also increase the risk for basal cell carcinoma. Molluscum contagiosum appears as small, dome-shaped, waxy papules that are usually painless. Keratoacanthoma appears as a rapidly growing, dome-shaped nodule with a central plug of keratin, but it usually resolves on its own. Actinic keratosis appears as rough, scaly patches on sun-exposed skin, but it is less likely to appear on the nose."
