This is likely caused by ischemia of the glans due to the urinary catheter, known as catheter-induced ischemic priapism. Immediate manual reduction of the foreskin is the most appropriate next step to relieve the pressure and prevent further ischemia. Emergency circumcision is not indicated in this acute situation. Referral to a urologist or topical betamethasone are not appropriate in this case."
