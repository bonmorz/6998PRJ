Low HU values on CT scan suggest small, radiolucent stones that are likely uric acid stones, which are more common in patients with gout. Uric acid stones are more likely to form in acidic urine, so the urinalysis is expected to show acidic urine. The presence of nitrites would suggest a urinary tract infection, but this is not typically associated with the pain and stone formation observed in this patient. Low specific gravity and alkaline urine are not specific to any particular condition and could have a wide range of causes."
