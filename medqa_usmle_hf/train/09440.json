The presence of hemolytic anemia (low hemoglobin, high reticulocyte count, and high indirect bilirubin) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase suggests a possible hemolytic process.

Ringed sideroblasts are seen in sideroblastic anemia, elliptocytes are seen in hereditary elliptocytosis, and target cells are seen in conditions such as thalassemia and liver disease."
