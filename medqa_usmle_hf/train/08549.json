The patient\u2019s symptoms and physical examination suggest pulmonary embolism, and among the options, alveolar hyperventilation is the most likely mechanism. This is because pulmonary embolism can cause decreased oxygenation and increased carbon dioxide, leading to hyperventilation to compensate. Secretion of vasodilating neurohumoral substances in pulmonary vascular bed and increased right ventricular preload are more likely to occur in other conditions such as heart failure or pulmonary hypertension. Decreased alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient is unlikely as the patient is presenting with breathlessness and hyperventilation, indicating a respiratory issue rather than an oxygenation issue."

The presentation suggests pulmonary embolism, which can lead to alveolar hyperventilation due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch. This also explains the presence of rales over the left infrascapular and scapular region.

Option A is incorrect as decreased alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient is not a feature of pulmonary embolism. Option B is incorrect as vasodilating substances are not secreted in pulmonary vascular bed during pulmonary embolism. Option D is incorrect as increased right ventricular preload is a result of pulmonary embolism and not the cause."
