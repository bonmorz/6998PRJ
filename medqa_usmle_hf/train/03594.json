The patient\u2019s elevated serum calcium and PTH level, as well as his bone pain and osteopenia, indicate primary hyperparathyroidism. A 99mTc sestamibi scan with ultrasound of the neck is the most appropriate next step in management as it can help locate the abnormal parathyroid tissue. CT scan of the neck can also be used but it is less sensitive than 99mTc sestamibi scan. Bone scan (DEXA) is used for measuring bone mineral density, but it is not needed for the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. Sestamibi scan only is not enough to localize the abnormal parathyroid tissue accurately."
