The symptoms and subcutaneous mass on the anterior neck suggest hyperthyroidism, and the reference to somatic activating mutations of TSH receptor genes suggests Graves' disease. Nonpitting edema is a classic symptom of myxedema, which is indicative of underlying Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, an autoimmune disorder that causes hypothyroidism. Therefore, nonpitting edema should raise concern for a different underlying etiology of her symptoms. Atrial fibrillation, lid lag, and fine tremor are all typical symptoms of hyperthyroidism."
