The physical examination findings do not support the severity of the patient\u2019s symptoms, which suggests that the patient may be exaggerating or embellishing their symptoms. Option B acknowledges the patient\u2019s discomfort but also opens the conversation to explore other factors that may be contributing to their pain, such as recent changes at work. Option A may reinforce the idea that the patient should stay home and not work, which may not be the best approach if the patient is able to work with some accommodations. Options C and D suggest a psychological component to the pain, which may not be appropriate without further evaluation or assessment."

The patient's symptoms and the lack of physical findings suggest that the pain may not be caused by a physical injury. Therefore, it is appropriate to discuss the recent changes at the patient's job to evaluate potential psychosocial factors contributing to the pain. Option A may encourage unnecessary absence from work, while options C and D suggest a psychological problem without sufficient evidence. Option B is the most appropriate and addresses the patient's concerns while providing further evaluation."
