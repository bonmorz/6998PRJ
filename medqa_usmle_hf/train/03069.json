The patient has clinical features of Marfan syndrome, which is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene encoding for fibrillin-1. The gene is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed for the disease to occur. However, the penetrance is variable, meaning that not all individuals with the gene mutation will show the same degree of symptoms. The patient's friend may have inherited a more penetrant mutation or have other genetic factors that increase the risk of tumors. Therefore, locus heterogeneity is the most likely explanation for their different outcomes."
