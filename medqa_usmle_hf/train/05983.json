The formation of the median umbilical ligament is a result of the obliteration of the urachus, connecting the bladder and the umbilicus during fetal development.

The formation of the median umbilical ligament is associated with the obliteration of the urachus, a structure that normally connects the bladder and umbilicus during fetal development. A failure of the median umbilical ligament to form may result in a patent urachus, which can lead to a fistula tract connecting the bladder and umbilicus. Thus, the correct answer is (C) Median umbilical ligament. The other options are not directly related to the development of the urachus."
