The drug described activates alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, which increases IP3 and causes vasoconstriction, leading to increased systemic vascular resistance and therefore increased mean arterial pressure. However, it also activates beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, leading to increased cAMP and increased contractility, thus maintaining cardiac output. This drug has only a negligible effect on bronchial smooth muscle cells, so there would be no changes in respiratory function. Therefore, the answer is (A) No change in cardiac output, Increased mean arterial pressure, Increased systemic vascular resistance."

The drug is likely to be dobutamine, which increases cardiac output by binding to beta-1 receptors on cardiac myocytes, leading to increased cAMP concentrations. It also causes vasodilation in arterioles but not in bronchial smooth muscle cells, leading to a negligible effect on systemic vascular resistance. Therefore, there is no change in cardiac output, an increase in mean arterial pressure due to vasodilation, and an increase in systemic vascular resistance due to vasoconstriction. The correct answer is (A), as it represents the changes caused by dobutamine administration."

The drug mentioned seems to be an adrenergic agonist, which increases cardiac output and mean arterial pressure while decreasing systemic vascular resistance. However, the negligible effect on bronchial smooth muscle cells suggests that the drug is not a conventional adrenergic agonist like epinephrine, but rather a selective beta1 agonist like dobutamine. Dobutamine has no direct effect on arteriolar smooth muscle cells, so there will be no change in systemic vascular resistance. Therefore, the correct answer is (A): no change in cardiac output, increased mean arterial pressure, and no change in systemic vascular resistance."

The drug described causes increased IP3 concentrations in arteriolar smooth muscle cells, which will cause vasoconstriction and increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR). However, it also causes increased cAMP concentrations in cardiac myocytes, leading to increased contractility and cardiac output (CO). The negligible effect on cAMP concentration in bronchial smooth muscle cells means that bronchial constriction is not affected. Therefore, the most likely set of cardiovascular changes following administration of this drug is no change in CO, increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) due to vasoconstriction and increased SVR.
