The presentation of bilateral wrist and hand swelling and tenderness with morning stiffness points to rheumatoid arthritis. The absence of vertebral tenderness rules out cervical spine involvement, making an x-ray unnecessary. Anti-Smith antibodies are specific to systemic lupus erythematosus, which is not as likely given the patient's symptoms, and a CT scan of the chest and a tuberculin skin test are not indicated in the evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis. X-ray of the cervical spine can be helpful to investigate cervical spine involvement in cases where there is neck pain."
