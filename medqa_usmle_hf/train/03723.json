The patient's presentation suggests alcohol withdrawal syndrome and his electrolyte levels are mostly normal except for a slightly low potassium level. However, the patient was given oral potassium and his potassium level on the next day is not available. The symptoms of diffuse weakness and muscle/bone pain suggest hypophosphatemia, which is commonly seen in alcohol withdrawal syndrome and can be exacerbated by refeeding syndrome (which can occur when a malnourished patient is given oral nutrition)."
