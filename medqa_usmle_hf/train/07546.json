The patient has suffered significant blood loss and is given 2 liters of saline, which will increase blood volume and preload, leading to increased cardiac output and increased right atrial pressure. Options A and B suggest a decrease in cardiac output, which would not be expected with fluid resuscitation. Option C suggests an increase in cardiac output but a decrease in right atrial pressure, which is unlikely as an increase in cardiac output would normally lead to an increase in right atrial pressure due to increased venous return."
