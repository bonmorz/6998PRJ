There is no evidence of proteinuria or other signs of preeclampsia, and the patient\u2019s creatinine, ALT, and platelet count are within normal limits. This suggests chronic hypertension. Gestational hypertension would not have occurred prior to the past month. Eclampsia would require evidence of proteinuria and other findings of preeclampsia, which are not present.
