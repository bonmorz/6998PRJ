The high potassium level suggests the need for immediate management with calcium, insulin, and dextrose, and the patient requires dialysis. The presentation is consistent with hyperkalemia, which can cause weakness, mobility issues, and severe hand pains. Captopril is indicated, as it can help lower blood pressure and decrease the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, may be useful in managing hypertension, but it can aggravate hyperkalemia. Beta-blockers, such as labetalol, and calcium channel blockers, such as nifedipine, are not recommended in the presence of hyperkalemia, as they can cause further increases in serum potassium."
