The intense right flank pain and elevated creatinine suggest possible renal dysfunction, which can cause metabolic acidosis. The ABG also shows a low HCO3-, confirming metabolic acidosis."

The reduced bicarbonate levels suggest that the anion gap should be examined to determine the cause of the metabolic acidosis. However, the lab values for serum electrolyte concentrations do not show an elevated anion gap, ruling out non-anion gap metabolic acidosis."
