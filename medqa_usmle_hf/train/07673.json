The patient's changes in personality, complaints of unpleasant odors, and the presence of both depressive and manic symptoms suggest the possibility of a brain neoplasm. Olfactory hallucinations are also known as phantom smells and are sometimes associated with brain tumors. Delusions of grandeur and thought broadcasting are characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, but do not necessarily warrant brain imaging to rule out a brain neoplasm. Echolalia is the repetition of words or phrases by a person with a psychiatric or neurological disorder and is not necessarily associated with brain neoplasms."
