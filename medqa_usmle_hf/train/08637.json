The positive VDRL suggests the patient has syphilis and should be confirmed with T. pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA). Although the patient is immune to hepatitis B virus based on the laboratory testing, further evaluation for hepatitis B infection is not necessary as the patient has no evidence of current or past infection. Therefore, option (A) and (D) can be eliminated. Although the patient is immune to HBV, she is not immune to other types of hepatitis, and therefore, HBV vaccination is not appropriate at this time. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) T. pallidum hemagglutination assay."
