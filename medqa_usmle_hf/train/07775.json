The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest an acute porphyria attack, which can be triggered by factors such as constipation, stress, or certain medications. Porphyrias involve defects in the heme biosynthetic pathway, and in this case, the most likely enzyme affected is porphobilinogen deaminase, leading to an accumulation of porphobilinogen and other porphyrin precursors in urine, which can cause darkening of urine. Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, Uroporphyrinogen III synthase, and Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase are also involved in the heme biosynthesis, but they are not related to acute porphyria."

The patient presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation, which are symptoms of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), which leads to accumulation of porphyrins and their precursors, resulting in neurovisceral symptoms. The darkening of urine, known as port-wine urine, is a characteristic feature of AIP. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) porphobilinogen deaminase."
