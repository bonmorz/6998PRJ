The presence of shortness of breath and retrosternal chest pain on exertion, along with a history of smoking, suggests significant cardiovascular disease. The auscultation findings suggest a systolic murmur heard best at the apex, which is characteristic of mitral regurgitation. However, the most likely cause of these symptoms is left ventricular failure, which may also cause mitral regurgitation. Aortic valve sclerosis may cause aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation, but this is not associated with the auscultation findings described. Right ventricular hypertrophy may cause a right ventricular heave, but it is not associated with the type of murmur described."
