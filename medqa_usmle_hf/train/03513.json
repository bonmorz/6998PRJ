Knee to chest positioning can increase systemic vascular resistance, decrease pulmonary blood flow, and increase blood flow to the systemic circulation, thus improving the patient\u2019s symptoms. Elevation of the lower extremities is used to treat shock, which is not present in this case. Indomethacin is a prostaglandin inhibitor that can be used to close a patent ductus arteriosus, but it is not indicated in this case. Hyperextension of the neck can increase pulmonary blood flow and worsen the patient\u2019s symptoms."
