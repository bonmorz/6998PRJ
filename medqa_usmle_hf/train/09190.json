The study involves monitoring subjects regularly over their lifetime, which suggests it is a prospective observational study.

An autopsy is performed to confirm the diagnosis of AD, but this does not make it a retrospective study. It is also not a case-control study as it involves a group without DM2 for comparison."

The study enrolls two groups and monitors them regularly over their lifetime for the development of symptoms of dementia. This makes it a prospective study.
