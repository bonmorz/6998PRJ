Glucocorticoids stimulate the maturation of type II alveolar cells, which produce surfactant. Surfactant reduces surface tension in the lungs, preventing alveolar collapse and promoting gas exchange. Therefore, increasing the secretory product of type II alveolar cells will help prevent respiratory distress in the premature infant. The other options do not address the underlying cause of respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants."
