Decreased salivation is a common finding in Bell's palsy due to the involvement of the nervus intermedius. Partial hearing loss is unlikely to occur as it is associated with the involvement of the vestibulocochlear nerve. Complete loss of taste to the tongue is associated with the involvement of the chorda tympani. A wrinkled forehead is associated with upper motor neuron lesions, while Bell\u2019s palsy is caused by a lower motor neuron lesion."

Among the options, decreased salivation is most commonly seen in patients with facial nerve palsy, as the facial nerve also innervates the submandibular gland and other salivary glands. Partial hearing loss is unlikely as the facial nerve does not innervate the ear. Complete loss of taste to the tongue is also unlikely as only the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is innervated by the facial nerve, and even then, taste loss is not always seen in facial nerve palsy. The wrinkled forehead is controlled by the upper facial muscles, which are not usually affected in a lower facial nerve palsy."
