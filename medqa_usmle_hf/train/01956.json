The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with Prader-Willi syndrome, which is caused by the loss of function of genes on chromosome 15. Symptoms can include poor muscle tone, almond-shaped eyes, downturned mouth, intellectual disability, and obesity. Hypogonadism is also commonly seen in Prader-Willi syndrome, which makes (C) the correct answer. Ataxia is not a common symptom, and hemihyperplasia and webbed neck are associated with different conditions."

Of the options, only hypogonadism is a common complication of Down syndrome. Ataxia may be seen in other conditions such as cerebral palsy, but is not typically associated with Down syndrome. Hemihyperplasia and webbed neck are associated with other genetic disorders such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Turner syndrome, respectively, but are not typically seen in Down syndrome."
