The patient's symptoms suggest that she has selective mutism, as she is reluctant to speak in certain social situations. This is different from social anxiety disorder, which involves fear and avoidance of social situations. The other two options, reactive attachment disorder and Rett syndrome, do not fit the patient's symptoms."

The presentation is classic for Selective Mutism, as the patient demonstrates a reluctance to speak in certain social situations. Reactive attachment disorder is typically associated with a history of neglect or deprivation. Social anxiety disorder is possible but less likely given the patient's history and presentation. Rett syndrome is unlikely as the patient has had normal previous well-child examinations."

Reactive attachment disorder is associated with a lack of attachment to caregivers, social anxiety disorder involves fear of social situations, and Rett syndrome involves neurological and developmental regression."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest selective mutism, which is a relatively rare childhood anxiety disorder characterized by a child's inability to speak and communicate effectively in select social settings, like school. Reactive attachment disorder is associated with neglect, Social anxiety disorder is associated with excessive fear and avoidance of social situations or performance situations, and Rett syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects brain development, resulting in severe mental and physical disability. None of these conditions match the patient\u2019s symptoms."

The patient's symptoms of being reluctant to speak only in certain situations (school) but not at home, and whispering to her mother, suggest selective mutism. Reactive attachment disorder would present with difficulties forming emotional bonds with others. Social anxiety disorder is characterized by anxiety in social situations, but not necessarily a refusal to speak. Rett syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects physical and cognitive development and would have presented symptoms much earlier in life."

The child's reluctance to speak in certain situations suggests selective mutism, which is a condition where a child is able to speak normally in some situations but remains silent in others. Reactive attachment disorder is characterized by a child being withdrawn and unresponsive to social interactions, while social anxiety disorder involves excessive fear of social situations. Rett syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the brain and is characterized by intellectual disability and impaired motor function. None of the symptoms described in the question suggest Rett syndrome."
