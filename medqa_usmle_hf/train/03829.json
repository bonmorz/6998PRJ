The symptoms and physical exam findings are suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is caused by intermittent collapse of the oropharynx during sleep.

Decreased levels of hypocretin-1 are associated with narcolepsy, which presents with excessive daytime sleepiness but not necessarily snoring.
