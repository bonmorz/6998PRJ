Metoprolol is a \u00df1 receptor antagonist, which blocks the effects of norepinephrine and epinephrine on the \u00df1 receptors in the heart and blood vessels, resulting in decreased heart rate and blood pressure. Beta1 receptors are predominantly located in the heart, while beta2 receptors are found in the lungs and blood vessels. Therefore, the drug will not affect serum renin levels as a consequence of \u00df2 receptor antagonism but will decrease serum renin levels as a consequence of \u00df1 receptor antagonism."

Metoprolol is a selective beta-1 receptor antagonist, which means it blocks the beta-1 receptors but not the beta-2 receptors. Beta-1 receptors are primarily located in the heart and kidneys, where they help regulate blood pressure and renin secretion. Therefore, blocking beta-1 receptors results in decreased renin secretion and decreased serum renin levels. Answer (C) is correct. Answers (A) and (B) are incorrect because they suggest increased serum renin levels, which is not expected with metoprolol. Answer (D) is incorrect because it suggests that the drug blocks beta-2 receptors, which is not true for metoprolol."

By blocking these receptors, metoprolol decreases the secretion of renin, leading to decreased serum renin levels. Therefore, the correct answer is (C)."
