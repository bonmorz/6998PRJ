PCT is associated with increased levels of uroporphyrinogen in the liver, leading to sun sensitivity and blistering. Biopsy of skin lesions in PCT shows a lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermalepidermal junction. The other options are associated with different dermatological conditions, such as pyogenic granulomas (microabscesses with fibrin and neutrophils), pemphigus vulgaris (intraepithelial cleavage with acantholysis), and sarcoidosis (noncaseating granulomas)."

The positive HCV RNA indicates the cause of infection is Hepatitis C.

Therefore, the biopsy would most likely show lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermalepidermal junction. Microabscesses with fibrin and neutrophils are seen in folliculitis or impetigo, intraepithelial cleavage with acantholysis is seen in pemphigus vulgaris, and noncaseating granulomas are seen in sarcoidosis."
