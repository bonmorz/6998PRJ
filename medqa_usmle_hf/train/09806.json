Loss of the regulatory process due to the absence of adrenal hormones can cause muscle weakness and difficulty with balance, which can explain her frequent bumping into objects. Ectopic secretion of a trophic hormone or hormonal receptor downregulation are less likely in this scenario, and feedback inhibition by an exogenous source is not relevant to this case."
