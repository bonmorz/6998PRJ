The erythema over the thenar and hypothenar eminences along with the blanching lesions with central red vessels suggest that the most likely underlying cause is increased circulating estrogen. This is a characteristic finding in patients with liver cirrhosis due to increased conversion of androgen to estrogen via aromatase activity in the liver."

The blanching lesions with a central red vessel are characteristic of spider angiomas, which are seen in patients with increased circulating estrogen.
