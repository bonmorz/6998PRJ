The description of the patient's symptoms indicates that he is suffering from Goodpasture's disease, an autoimmune disease that affects the lungs and kidneys. This disease is characterized by the production of antibodies against the collagen in the basement membrane of these organs. This process damages the organs and leads to the symptoms described by the patient. Goodpasture's disease shares some similarities with autoimmune hemolytic anemia in terms of the production of autoantibodies, making option (D) the best answer choice."
