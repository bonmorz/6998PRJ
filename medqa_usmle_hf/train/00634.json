The patient's symptoms suggest peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and the most appropriate next step in management is to perform an ankle-brachial index (ABI) test. ABI compares the blood pressure in the ankle to the blood pressure in the arm, and a result of less than 0.90 is indicative of PAD. Duplex ultrasonography may be used to confirm the diagnosis and localize the occlusion, while nerve conduction studies and biopsy of tibial artery are not typically indicated in the initial work-up of PAD."
