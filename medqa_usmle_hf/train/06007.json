The patient\u2019s low blood pressure and distended abdomen with tenderness suggest hypovolemia, likely from internal bleeding.

Emergency laparotomy may be necessary if the patient\u2019s condition deteriorates or if the bleeding cannot be controlled with other measures, but it is not the initial step in management."

Based on the patient's presentation of trauma to the torso and signs of shock (low blood pressure, high heart rate, cool/clammy skin), the next best step would be fluid resuscitation to stabilize the patient's hemodynamic status. Options A and B (abdominal radiograph or CT) may be ordered later, but fluid resuscitation is the immediate priority.
