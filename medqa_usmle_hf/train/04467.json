Antibiotics are not effective against viral infections, so option A can be eliminated. A chest radiograph is not necessary for the diagnosis of bronchiolitis, so option B can be eliminated. Intubation is not necessary at this time, as the child is currently playing with toys and able to maintain oxygen saturation, so option C can be eliminated. Monitoring the infant's symptoms, including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and hydration status, is the most appropriate next step in management. Supportive care, such as humidified oxygen, hydration, and suctioning, may be necessary. In severe cases, hospitalization may be required."

However, a chest radiograph may not be necessary at this point. Azithromycin and ceftriaxone are antibiotics and are not indicated here. Intubation is a more invasive intervention and is not necessary as the child is still playing with toys. The most appropriate next step is to monitor the child\u2019s oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, administer supplemental oxygen if necessary, and observe the child\u2019s clinical status closely. Close monitoring will help determine if additional interventions are necessary."

Azithromycin and ceftriaxone can be considered if there is suspicion of bacterial infection, but it is not the first-line treatment for bronchiolitis. Chest radiograph is not necessary for diagnosis but may be done if there is concern for possible complications or alternate diagnoses.

The presentation suggests bronchiolitis or asthma exacerbation, which are usually viral and do not require antibiotics. Chest radiograph is not necessary in the absence of significant respiratory distress or suspicion of pneumonia. Intubation is not necessary at this time since the child is playing with toys and has adequate oxygen saturation. Monitoring is the most appropriate next step, with pulse oximetry and respiratory rate measurements, as well as observation for signs of respiratory distress. If the child develops severe respiratory distress or hypoxemia, then supplemental oxygen, nebulized bronchodilators and possibly corticosteroids may be considered."

Azithromycin and ceftriaxone are antibiotics used for bacterial infections, which are not indicated in this case. A chest radiograph may be helpful in ruling out other conditions but is not necessary at this point.

Oxygen saturation is already at 95% on room air, so intubation is not necessary. Antibiotics are not typically indicated for viral illnesses, so option (A) is incorrect. While a chest radiograph may help support the diagnosis, it is not necessary in this case and would not change management, so option (B) is incorrect. The most appropriate next step is monitoring the child\u2019s symptoms and providing supportive care, such as humidified oxygen, hydration, and close observation for signs of respiratory distress. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer."
