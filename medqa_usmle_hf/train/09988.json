Laparoscopy or salpingostomy can be considered if the patient\u2019s condition worsens, but methotrexate is not appropriate in this case since there is no definitive diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy."

The patient's positive serum hCG and lack of a gestational sac on transvaginal ultrasound suggest an ectopic pregnancy. The best next step in management is to repeat the ultrasound and serum hCG in 48 hours to monitor for any changes. If there is no change or worsening, surgical intervention may be necessary. Laparoscopy and salpingostomy are surgical options, while methotrexate is a medical option for management of ectopic pregnancy.

Methotrexate may also be an option for ectopic pregnancy, but again, a firm diagnosis must be made first."
