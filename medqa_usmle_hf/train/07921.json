In ESRD, the kidneys cannot effectively remove waste products from the blood and patients need to undergo hemodialysis to filter the blood. Patients on hemodialysis often have a restricted protein diet, but increasing protein intake is crucial in order to maintain muscle mass and reduce the risk of malnutrition. Sodium intake may need to be restricted due to hypertension, and potassium intake may also need to be restricted due to the risk of hyperkalemia. Fiber intake is not a significant concern in this patient's management."
