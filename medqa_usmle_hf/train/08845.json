The patient had a sudden onset of severe crushing retrosternal pain that radiated to his left arm, and elevated troponins and CK-MB. This indicates acute myocardial infarction. Since the patient died within 2 hours, the gross examination of the heart will not show any significant changes yet. It takes several hours to several days for the gross changes to appear. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) normal heart tissue."
