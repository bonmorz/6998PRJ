The down- and inward dislocation of the lens, along with the marfanoid habitus and mental retardation, suggests a diagnosis of Homocystinuria. The significant reduction in the conversion of 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate is also characteristic of this condition. Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue, but does not usually cause dislocation of the lens. Alkaptonuria is a metabolic disorder that causes urine to turn black upon exposure to air. Phenylketonuria is an inherited disorder that results in an inability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine."
