The patient\u2019s occupation and exposure history suggest Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), which is associated with rodent infestations. The symptoms of fevers, chills, fatigue, myalgias, and subsequent shortness of breath further support this diagnosis. The diffuse rales bilaterally on physical examination are consistent with pulmonary edema, which is a common component of HPS due to increased permeability of pulmonary capillaries. Decreased serum albumin level is also commonly seen in HPS due to increased vascular permeability, leading to third spacing and fluid accumulation in the lungs. Binding to sialic acid residues in human cells is associated with influenza virus, which is not consistent with this patient's symptoms. Cerebral spinal fluid pleocytosis is associated with meningitis or encephalitis, which are not consistent with this patient's symptoms. Widened mediastinum on chest radiograph is associated with aortic dissection or rupture, which is not consistent with this patient's symptoms."
