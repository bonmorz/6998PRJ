The patient\u2019s history of a rash that subsided 2 months ago, living in Connecticut, and working as a landscaper suggest the most likely cause to be Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a possible cause of septic arthritis but the patient does not have a history of sexual activity. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disorder that usually affects both sides of the body, while Campylobacter jejuni is more commonly associated with gastroenteritis than joint pain."

The patient has a history of a rash and lives in Connecticut, which are both suggestive of Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. The synovial fluid analysis also shows a high leukocyte count and neutrophils, which is consistent with bacterial arthritis. The negative Gram stain rules out Neisseria gonorrhoeae as a cause, and there is no mention of joint deformities or morning stiffness, ruling out rheumatoid arthritis. Campylobacter jejuni is not commonly associated with joint involvement."
