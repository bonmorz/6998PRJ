The CT scan of the head shows ventricular dilation and narrowing of the sulci, which is indicative of this condition. Parkinson\u2019s disease would have tremors and bradykinesia, but the patient has stiff movement and postural instability, which suggests a gait disturbance rather than Parkinson\u2019s disease. Early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease would have different symptoms such as difficulty with speech and mood changes. Progressive supranuclear palsy would have vertical gaze palsy and rapid onset, whereas Normal-pressure hydrocephalus has a gradual onset."
