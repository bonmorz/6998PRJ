Scar formation is a part of the healing process of acute inflammation, and it involves fibroblast proliferation and deposition of extracellular matrix components. Chickenpox lesions heal by re-epithelialization, leaving a small scar. While scars are mostly permanent, over time they may fade and become less noticeable. Option A is incorrect as complete resolution of acute inflammation does not always result in scars. Option C is also incorrect as not all scars are permanent and may fade over time. Option D is incorrect as neutrophils, plasma cells, and macrophages are not predominant in chickenpox lesions."

The chickenpox lesions go through a healing process involving re-epithelialization and collagen deposition, which can result in scars. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because scars are not equivalent to complete resolution of acute inflammation. Option (C) is incorrect because not all chickenpox cases result in permanent scarring. Option (D) is incorrect because neutrophils, plasma cells, and macrophages are not the predominant cells in the formation of chickenpox scars."
