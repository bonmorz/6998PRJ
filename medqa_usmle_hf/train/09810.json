The patient's behavior in this scenario fits the criteria for histrionic personality disorder, which is characterized by attention-seeking behavior, flirtatiousness, emotional instability, and rapidly shifting moods.

Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by odd or eccentric behavior and may involve social anxiety or paranoia, but it does not usually involve attention-seeking or dramatic behavior."
