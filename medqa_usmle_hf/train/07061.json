This is because IPV contains inactivated virus, which means that the immune system is exposed to a larger amount of viral proteins, leading to a stronger antibody response. OPV, on the other hand, contains live attenuated virus, which can lead to replication within the body and a weaker antibody response."

IPV does not carry this risk and is therefore recommended for use in the United States."

Option (C) is incorrect as it describes the role of CD4+ T cells in controlling viral infections, but is not a specific advantage of IPV over OPV. Option (D) is incorrect as IPV does not produce higher titers of mucosal IgG antibodies than OPV."

Therefore, the pediatrician is referring to the advantage of IPV over OPV in terms of safety and immunogenicity. Option (B) is incorrect because it refers to the mechanism of action of T cells, which is not relevant to the advantage of IPV over OPV. Option (C) is also incorrect because it refers to the role of CD4+ T cells, which is not relevant to the advantage of IPV over OPV.

One advantage of IPV over OPV is that IPV is known to produce higher titers of serum IgG antibodies than OPV, which can provide stronger and long-lasting protection against polio. This is especially important for children who may have weaker immune systems or live in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene, where they are at higher risk of exposure to the polio virus. While both IPV and OPV can produce virus-specific T cells, the advantage of IPV in terms of antibody production is the main reason why it is recommended for routine immunization in the US."
