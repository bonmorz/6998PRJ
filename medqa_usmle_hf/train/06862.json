The presence of an extra X chromosome (47, XXX) is indicative of Trisomy X syndrome, which can occur as a result of an error in maternal meiosis. Specifically, it is most likely to occur during anaphase II, which is when separation of sister chromatids occurs, resulting in an unequal distribution of chromosomes. This can lead to the formation of eggs with an extra X chromosome. Paternal meiosis and the other stages of maternal meiosis are less likely to result in Trisomy X syndrome."
