The elevated glucose suggests possible diabetes. Eplerenone is used to treat hypertension and can be useful for a patient with Cushing's syndrome. Insulin may be needed to treat the elevated glucose, but it does not address the underlying condition causing the symptoms. Hydrochlorothiazide and Torsemide are diuretics and would not be useful in this case."
