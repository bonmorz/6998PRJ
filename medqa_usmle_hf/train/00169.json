The patient's last vaccination history is uncertain, and the puncture wound is contaminated with soil, which increases the risk of tetanus. Therefore, the patient should receive both tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine and human tetanus immunoglobulin. Option A is incorrect because fever is not a contraindication for tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine administration. Option B is incorrect because even if the patient has a past medical history of tetanus, it does not confer lifelong immunity, and post-exposure prophylaxis is still necessary. Option C is also incorrect because the duration of protection offered by the Tdap vaccine is uncertain, and a recent booster may not be protective in all cases."
