The patient has a history of previous myocardial infarction, and the current medications suggest that the patient has a heart condition.

The decreased serum level of iron and increased serum level of ferritin suggest that the anemia is not caused by iron deficiency. The anemia of chronic disease is characterized by normocytic, normochromic anemia, and is most likely in this patient.
