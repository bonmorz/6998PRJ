The symptoms described in the case are consistent with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which has a higher incidence in boys than girls, with a ratio of about 4:1. Option B is not correct as there is no evidence of a link between maternal age and ASD. Option C is also not correct as there is no consistent evidence of a link between maternal smoking and ASD. Option D is partially correct, as some studies have shown an association between low prenatal maternal serum vitamin D levels and ASD, but further research is needed to confirm this link."
