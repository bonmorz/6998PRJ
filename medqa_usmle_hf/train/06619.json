A tissue sample from the mass would confirm the histopathology consistent with visceral larva migrans caused by Toxocara canis. Ancylostoma braziliense and Ascaris lumbricoides are also helminths that can cause abdominal pain and eosinophilia, but they are more commonly associated with skin manifestations (cutaneous larva migrans) and respiratory symptoms (ascariasis), respectively.
