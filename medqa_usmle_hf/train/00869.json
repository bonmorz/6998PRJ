The patient feels \u2018down\u2019 most days of the week living on his own and doesn't have much energy, and he gets defensive and angry when asked about the kitchen fire and problems with the electricity. This is different from Delirium, which presents with acute onset of confusion and fluctuations in cognition, and Dementia, which presents with progressive decline in cognitive function. Pick\u2019s disease is a rare type of dementia that affects frontal and temporal lobes, and is not likely in this patient's case."
