The inability to open the mouth is a common symptom of temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD), which can occur after a traumatic injury or as a result of chronic clenching or grinding of the teeth. TMD is not caused by impaired motor neuron release of ACh or cross-reactivity of bacterial antigens, nor is it typically associated with bacterial infiltration of the central nervous system. GABA is a neurotransmitter involved in muscle relaxation and may play a role in TMD-related muscle spasms or tension. Therefore, impaired motor neuron release of GABA is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms."
