Bartter syndrome also presents with low potassium and alkalosis, but the patient\u2019s symptoms are more consistent with Gitelman\u2019s.

The low serum potassium and magnesium levels and alkalosis in the laboratory findings are consistent with Gitelman\u2019s syndrome, which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a defect in the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, leading to electrolyte imbalances. Bartter syndrome is also a renal tubular disorder but is characterized by a defect in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, resulting in hypokalemic alkalosis. Liddle syndrome and Conn\u2019s syndrome are both forms of hypertension caused by mutations in sodium channel and aldosterone receptor, respectively, but are not consistent with the patient's symptoms in this case."
