The graph shows an increase in both end-diastolic volume and end-systolic pressure, which indicates increased contractility of the heart. Among the options, only Gq-coupled receptor activation can increase myocardial contractility. Selective AT1 receptor blockade can lower blood pressure and increase cardiac output, but not necessarily contractility. Gs-coupled receptor activation can increase heart rate and contractility, but would not necessarily affect ventricular pressure-volume relationship. M2 receptor activation would actually decrease contractility."
