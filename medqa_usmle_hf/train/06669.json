The patient presents with symptoms of back pain, dark urine, and irregular masses on deep abdominal palpation, which suggests renal cell carcinoma. The most common mutation associated with renal cell carcinoma is a mutation in the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene, which is located on chromosome 3. However, among the options given, chromosome 16 is known to have mutations associated with renal cell carcinoma as well. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Chromosome 16. It is important to note that additional diagnostic testing would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma, such as imaging studies and a biopsy."
