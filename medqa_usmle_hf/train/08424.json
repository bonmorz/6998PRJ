The symptoms suggest that the patient is experiencing postoperative delirium and the most likely cause is opioid-induced delirium. Administering intravenous lorazepam can help alleviate symptoms of agitation and restlessness. Administering naloxone can reverse the effects of opioids, but the patient's pain has already been controlled with intravenous morphine. Administering dexamethasone is not necessary for postoperative delirium. Administering 5% dextrose in 1/2 normal saline may not be helpful in managing the patient's symptoms."
