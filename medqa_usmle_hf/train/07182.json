However, the presence of pale conjunctivae, angular cheilitis, and glossitis, along with low hemoglobin and MCV values, suggests iron-deficiency anemia due to malabsorption from some gastrointestinal disease such as IBD. A small intestine biopsy showing PAS-positive macrophages confirms this suspicion. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to treat the underlying disease, for which intravenous ceftriaxone may be used to treat any infection, followed by appropriate management of IBD. A gluten-free diet is a treatment option for celiac disease, but this is not the most likely diagnosis in this case, and a stool test for occult blood was negative, so oral rifampin and oral doxycycline are unlikely to be necessary."
