The patient's symptoms, including severe, deep, sharp pain, warmer, swollen, and reddish appearance of the right hand and forearm, and intense pain upon light touching, suggest complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Compartment syndrome is characterized by pain and swelling that worsens with movement and at rest, and can lead to nerve damage or muscle death. Limb ischemia usually presents with pain when the arm or leg is used and is relieved at rest. Cellulitis is characterized by redness, warmth, swelling, and pain in the affected area, and may be accompanied by fever and chills. None of these conditions match the patient's symptoms and medical history as closely as CRPS."

Cellulitis usually presents with erythema, swelling, and warmth but not severe pain, and the laboratory results may show leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers. Compartment syndrome is characterized by severe pain, pallor, paresthesia, and paralysis, and the neurovascular status of the affected limb may be compromised. Limb ischemia is characterized by pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia, and paralysis, and the laboratory results may show elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels."
