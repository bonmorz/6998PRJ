The patient's symptoms are consistent with somatic symptom disorder, which is characterized by persistent, distressing physical symptoms that have no clear medical cause. The patient has undergone multiple medical tests and procedures with no results and is experiencing significant anxiety and functional impairment as a result of her symptoms. This is different from functional neurologic symptom disorder, which involves neurological symptoms such as weakness or seizures without a clear medical cause, and from hypochondriasis, which involves persistent fear of having a serious medical illness despite reassurance from healthcare professionals. Factitious disorder involves intentional fabrication of physical or psychological symptoms for psychological reasons, which does not seem to be the case in this scenario."
