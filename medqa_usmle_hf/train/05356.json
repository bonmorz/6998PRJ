The symptoms, including chest pain and pressure radiating to the jaw, and the ST-segment elevation on the ECG, suggest unstable angina or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Aspirin is given to all patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, but clopidogrel, beta-blockers, and thrombolytics are inappropriate for NSTEMI. Nitrates can be given to relieve symptoms, but calcium channel blockers and nitrates are the preferred treatment regimen for NSTEMI."

The patient's presentation is consistent with acute coronary syndrome, specifically unstable angina or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), as evidenced by the ECG with ST-segment elevation and normal cardiac enzymes. Aspirin is commonly used to reduce the risk of further cardiac events. Nitrates and calcium channel blockers are also commonly used to relieve chest pain and improve blood flow to the heart. Beta-blockers may be used in patients with NSTEMI but may be contraindicated in patients with low blood pressure or evidence of heart failure. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment regimen for this patient's suspected condition is calcium channel blockers and nitrates."
