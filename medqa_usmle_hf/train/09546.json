The patient\u2019s symptoms, including facial swelling and difficulty speaking and swallowing, are consistent with angioedema. Impaired bradykinin metabolism is a common cause of angioedema, which can be caused by medications such as ACE inhibitors used for hypertension. The normal C4 levels indicate that the mechanism is not related to Type 2 hypersensitivity or immune-complex deposition. Anaphylactoid reactions usually involve more rapid onset and may have different symptoms."

The swelling of the lips and tongue, along with the patient's medical history, suggest that the most likely cause is impaired bradykinin metabolism.

Type 2 hypersensitivity reactions involve IgG or IgM antibodies and are not likely in this case. An anaphylactoid reaction would involve the release of mediators such as histamine, which is not mentioned in the presentation. Immune-complex deposition generally involves IgG, IgM, or IgA antibodies and is not likely in this case either."

Type 2 hypersensitivity reactions involve antibodies attacking cells, anaphylactoid reactions are similar to anaphylaxis but not caused by IgE, and immune-complex deposition involves the deposition of immune complexes in tissues. These mechanisms are less likely to be the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms."

The normal C4 level suggests that the cause is not an immune-complex deposition. The absence of recent insect bites or known allergies makes type 2 hypersensitivity less likely. Anaphylactoid reaction may cause similar symptoms but there is no evidence of exposure to an allergen. Impaired bradykinin metabolism, such as in hereditary angioedema or from medications like ACE inhibitors, can cause angioedema. Given the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes, it is possible that she is taking an ACE inhibitor, which should be discontinued immediately. Treatment with antihistamines or epinephrine may not be effective in this case, and instead, treatment with fresh frozen plasma or a bradykinin receptor antagonist like icatibant may be necessary."
