Among the options, only IL-2 is a cytokine that can activate T-cells. Interleukin 4 is involved in the differentiation of T-helper cells and B-cells. Interleukin 6 is involved in the production of acute-phase proteins and immune responses. Interleukin 8 is involved in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils."
