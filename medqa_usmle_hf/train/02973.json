Rouleaux formation, the stacking of red blood cells in a column formation, can be seen in multiple myeloma due to the increased level of immunoglobulin in the blood causing RBCs to stick together. Atypical lymphocytes are seen in viral infections, schistocytes are seen in hemolytic anemia, and target cells are seen in thalassemia."
