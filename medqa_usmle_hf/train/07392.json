Uric acid precipitation is commonly associated with gout but is not a predisposing factor for struvite stones. Ethylene glycol ingestion can lead to calcium oxalate crystal formation but not struvite stones. A hereditary deficiency in amino acid reabsorption can lead to cystine stones, which have a different chemical composition than struvite stones."
