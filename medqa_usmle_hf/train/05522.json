The inhibition of the degradation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate leads to increased levels of this molecule, which promotes stronger and more frequent heart contractions. The most likely adverse effect of this drug is hypotension, as an increase in cardiac contractility can lead to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. Hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, and bronchospasm are not typically associated with this type of drug."
