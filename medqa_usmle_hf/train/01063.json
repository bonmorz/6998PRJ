The Candida skin injection test is a type of delayed hypersensitivity test that measures the cell-mediated immune response. The induration at the injection site is due to the infiltration of T-lymphocytes and macrophages. Mast cells and basophils are not involved in cell-mediated immunity, and fibroblasts are not involved in immune responses at all. Therefore, the correct answer is T-cells. As there was no evidence of induration at the injection site, it suggests that the child's cell-mediated immunity may not be functioning optimally."
