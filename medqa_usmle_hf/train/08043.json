The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest multiple myeloma, which can cause fatigue and decreased urine output, as well as anemia and kidney dysfunction.

Immunoglobulin light chains are produced by the cancer cells and can cause kidney damage, leading to decreased urine output. Renal deposition of AL amyloid can also cause kidney damage but is less likely in this case as the urine dipstick is negative for protein. Anti double-stranded DNA antibodies are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus but do not explain the symptoms. A hypersensitivity reaction would not cause the combination of symptoms seen in the patient."

Therefore, the answer is (A) Immunoglobulin light chains."
