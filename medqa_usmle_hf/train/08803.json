However, the patient is also consuming a lot of caffeine and not exercising, which may contribute to her fatigue. The fact that she likes to chew on ice after drinking coffee may also be a sign of pica, which can be associated with iron-deficiency anemia. Restless legs syndrome can also be associated with iron-deficiency anemia, so (D) is the most likely answer. Hemolytic anemia and megaloblastic anemia are less likely given the patient's history and symptoms. Hyperparathyroidism is not likely to be related to this patient's symptoms or medical history."
