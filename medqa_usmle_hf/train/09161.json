Options A and D are incorrect because decreasing or increasing the dosage by small increments may not be adequate to meet the unique requirements of pregnancy."

The breast engorgement and enlarged uterus suggest pregnancy. During pregnancy, levothyroxine requirements increase by approximately 20% to 30%. Therefore, the correct answer is increasing the levothyroxine dosage by 20% to 30%. Option A, B, and D are not correct because decreasing or discontinuing levothyroxine may harm both the mother and fetus, and increasing the dosage by a fixed amount is not appropriate in pregnancy."

Levothyroxine should not be discontinued or decreased because the patient has hypothyroidism. Since she is pregnant, her dosage of levothyroxine should be increased by 20%-30%. A gradual increase in dosage is not necessary in this situation."

The enlarged uterus also confirms this. During pregnancy, levothyroxine requirements increase, and therefore thyroid hormone replacement may need to be increased by 20%-30%. Option (A) is incorrect as decreasing the dose could lead to hypothyroidism, option (B) is incorrect as continuing on the current dose may not be sufficient, and option (D) may not be sufficient to bring thyroid levels to the necessary levels during pregnancy."

The slightly elevated TSH, normal total T4, and high free T4 suggest that the patient is experiencing physiologic hyperthyroidism due to pregnancy. The recommended treatment is to increase the dose of levothyroxine by 20% to 30%, as pregnancy increases the need for thyroxine.

The slightly elevated TSH suggests that the patient's hypothyroidism is not optimally controlled, which could be interfering with ovulation and leading to the missed mense. The physical examination findings suggest pregnancy. Insufficient thyroid hormone levels can lead to infertility and miscarriage; therefore, increasing the dosage of levothyroxine by 20-30% would be the best choice to manage the patient's hypothyroidism during pregnancy. Discontinuation of levothyroxine would be harmful to the pregnancy. Decreasing the dosage of levothyroxine would not adequately manage the patient's hypothyroidism during pregnancy. Gradually increasing the dosage of levothyroxine would not address the immediate concern of hypothyroidism during pregnancy."

The slight elevation could possibly be due to pregnancy. The patient\u2019s increased mobility, cervical softening, and enlarged uterus are all indicative of pregnancy. Thus, we can infer that the patient is pregnant and her levothyroxine dosage should be increased by 20%-30% to support her and her baby\u2019s thyroid function."
