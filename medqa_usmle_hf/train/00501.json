Increasing the sample size will decrease the standard error of the mean, which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. This means that the sample means will be more reliable estimators of the population mean. Option A is incorrect because the standard deviation is a population parameter, not a sample statistic, and is not affected by sample size. Option C is incorrect because increasing sample size does not necessarily increase the risk of systematic error. Option D is incorrect because increasing sample size actually decreases the probability of type II error, which is the probability of failing to reject a false null hypothesis."

The standard deviation will not necessarily be affected by the increase in sample size, so option (A) is incorrect. Option (C) is also incorrect, as there is no indication that the study design or methods will be modified with the increased funding, so the risk of systematic error is unchanged. Option (D) is also incorrect, as increasing the sample size would decrease the probability of a type II error, as a larger sample size improves the power of the study to detect a true difference or relationship in the population."

None of the other options are directly related to sample size; decreasing the standard deviation would require some intervention other than changing the sample size, increasing the risk of systematic error would be a result of biases in study design or sampling, and increasing the probability of type II error would result from insufficient statistical power, which is not directly related to sample size."
