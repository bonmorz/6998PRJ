The patient\u2019s symptoms, specifically watery diarrhea and right upper quadrant pain with fever, in addition to being HIV-positive and non-compliant with medications, suggest the most likely diagnosis to be cryptosporidiosis. Irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic condition and does not typically cause fever or malaise. Norovirus and ETEC may cause similar symptoms, but the patient\u2019s HIV status and low CD4+ count make a parasitic infection more likely. Stool microscopy results will help confirm the diagnosis."

The symptoms of watery diarrhea, right upper quadrant pain, fever, malaise, nausea, and anorexia are consistent with cryptosporidiosis, which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV/AIDS. Normal physical examination does not rule out cryptosporidiosis, as it is primarily an intestinal disease. The low WBC count and low CD4+ cell count are also indicative of an opportunistic infection. While irritable bowel syndrome can cause diarrhea, it typically does not cause fever or right upper quadrant pain. Norovirus typically causes vomiting in addition to diarrhea, and traveler\u2019s diarrhea due to ETEC is unlikely given the patient\u2019s immunocompromised status."
