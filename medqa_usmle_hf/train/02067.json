The polysomnographic study suggests sleep apnea, which is often caused by the collapse of the upper airway, usually due to the tongue or other soft tissues falling back into the throat. Genioglossus muscle is one of the main muscles that controls the tongue's position and movements, and stimulating it can help to prevent the tongue from blocking the airway during sleep.
