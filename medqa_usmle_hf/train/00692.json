Novobiocin-sensitive, coagulase-negative cocci are commonly associated with prosthetic valve endocarditis, which is the most likely scenario in this case. Option A describes Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is more commonly associated with community-acquired pneumonia. Option C describes group A streptococci, which are more commonly associated with streptococcal pharyngitis. Option D describes optochin-resistant streptococci, such as Streptococcus mitis or Streptococcus oralis, which can cause endocarditis, but are less commonly associated with prosthetic valve endocarditis."
