The patient\u2019s worry about being the slowest on her swim team and her concern about fitness suggest possible body image issues and perhaps an eating disorder. The calluses on dorsum of her hand can suggest excessive exercise, and the irregular menses may be due to polycystic ovarian syndrome. Among the options, only Lanugo refers to the fine, soft hair that grows on the face and body due to malnutrition and can be associated with eating disorders. Dental cavities can also be associated with frequent vomiting, which is a potential symptom of an eating disorder."

Calluses on the dorsum of her right hand suggest she may be purging or engaging in excessive exercise. Dental cavities are associated with purging due to the acid from vomit damaging teeth. Galactorrhea is excessive milk production and is not associated with this patient\u2019s symptoms. Lanugo is a fine, soft hair that grows on the face and body of some people with anorexia nervosa and is not present in this patient's examination.

Lanugo, or the growth of fine hair on the body, is associated with anorexia nervosa. Galactorrhea is not associated with eating disorders. Metatarsal stress fractures are more commonly associated with athletes who engage in high-impact activities, such as running. Dental cavities are associated with eating disorders because people with eating disorders often consume foods high in sugar and may induce vomiting, which can lead to tooth decay. Dark circles under the eyes can also be a sign of vitamin deficiencies, which can be common in people with eating disorders. Calluses on the dorsum of the hand can be associated with frequent self-induced vomiting or excessive exercise."

The patient is showing signs of low self-esteem and body-image concerns which are often associated with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa. Lanugo, a fine hair that appears on the body, is a common symptom of anorexia nervosa. However, calluses on the dorsum of the right hand suggest excessive exercise, which is more indicative of bulimia nervosa. Dental cavities are often seen in individuals with anorexia nervosa due to malnutrition and avoidance of certain foods. Galactorrhea, or lactation from the breasts, is not typically associated with eating disorders. Metatarsal stress fractures may be seen in individuals with excessive exercise, but the calluses on dorsum of the right hand suggest involvement of upper extremities rather than lower extremities."

Dental cavities are also commonly seen in patients with bulimia nervosa due to the frequent vomiting associated with the disorder.

Lanugo, or fine hair growth, may be a physical exam finding in such cases, but it is not present in this scenario. Metatarsal stress fractures may be associated with over-exercising, which can occur in eating disorders, but dark circles under the eyes and calluses on the hand are more suggestive of bulimia nervosa, which can also have associated dental cavities due to purging behaviors.
