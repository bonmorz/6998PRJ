The patient's symptoms, including unintentional weight loss, irregularly irregular rhythm on auscultation, and an enlarged thyroid with no lymphadenopathy or bruit, suggest the most likely diagnosis is toxic multinodular goiter. The scintigraphy shows patchy uptake with multiple hot and cold areas, which is consistent with this diagnosis. Graves' disease would show diffuse increased uptake on scintigraphy, while Hashimoto's thyroiditis and subacute granulomatous thyroiditis are unlikely given the absence of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody and the patient's clinical presentation."
