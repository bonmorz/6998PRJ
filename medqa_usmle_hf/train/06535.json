Option D indicates a low urine osmolality, high urine sodium, and high fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), which suggests prerenal azotemia due to bladder distention. The absence of casts suggests that there is no kidney damage yet.

The patient presents with symptoms of acute urinary retention and a distended bladder, indicating obstruction of the urinary tract. The lab values that would most likely be found in a urinalysis of this patient are urine osmolality of 300 mOsmol/kg H2O, urine Na+ of 45 mEq/L, FENa of 5%, and no casts. These values indicate a post-renal kidney injury due to bladder outlet obstruction. The low urine osmolality and high urine Na+ suggest impaired reabsorption, while the high FENa indicates reduced fractional excretion of Na+. The absence of casts rules out pigment nephropathy and the presence of hematuria."

Based on the presented symptoms, the patient is likely experiencing urinary retention, which can lead to a distended bladder and tenderness in the lower abdomen.

The decrease in urine osmolality and increase in urine sodium concentration with a high fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) indicate renal dysfunction. The absence of red blood cell casts suggests that the renal failure is not caused by glomerulonephritis or vasculitis. Therefore, the most likely answer is (D)."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest acute urinary retention, which can cause a high-pressure buildup in the urinary tract and damage the kidneys. Option D is the most likely because it presents with low urine osmolality, high urine sodium, and a high fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), indicating acute kidney injury. The absence of casts suggests that the injury is not due to glomerular damage, and the absence of red blood cell casts eliminates option C. Option B presents with muddy brown casts, which are diagnostic of acute tubular necrosis but are not present in this patient. Option A presents with mild hyposmolality, which does not match the severity of the patient's condition."

The patient is showing signs of acute urinary retention, which can cause a post-obstructive diuresis in which the kidneys produce large amounts of urine after the obstruction is relieved. This would result in a dilute urine with low osmolality, high sodium, and high FENa. Option D matches these criteria. The presence of casts or red blood cells indicates a possible underlying renal disease, which is not suggested in the scenario."
