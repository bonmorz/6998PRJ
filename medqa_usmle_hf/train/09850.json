The presentation of the patient suggests that he has developed pressure ulcers, which are caused by prolonged pressure on the skin and underlying tissues. Frequent repositioning is the most important prevention measure for pressure ulcers, as it relieves pressure on bony prominences and improves blood flow to the affected areas. Nutritional supplementation can also help prevent pressure ulcers by providing the body with the necessary nutrients for tissue repair and maintenance, but it is not as important as frequent repositioning. Topical antibiotics and anti-coagulants are not indicated for the prevention of pressure ulcers."
