The development of peripheral edema suggests fluid overload. Slow initiation of TPN would help prevent this complication by allowing the patient's body to gradually adjust to the increased fluid intake. Using enteral nutrition may not have been possible due to the patient's pneumonia and need for intubation. Initiation of furosemide may be necessary if the patient develops fluid overload, but it would not prevent the complication. Low-sugar TPN would not impact the development of peripheral edema."

The complication seen in this patient is likely refeeding syndrome, which can occur when a malnourished patient is given too many calories too quickly, leading to shifts in electrolytes and fluid balance. Slow initiation of TPN can help prevent this complication. Enteral nutrition may also be a good option but it may not be feasible in this patient who is intubated and has a history of aspiration. Furosemide may be useful for managing the peripheral edema but would not prevent the refeeding syndrome. The use of low-sugar TPN would not prevent the electrolyte and fluid shifts seen in refeeding syndrome."

                "content": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for help. The patient is suffering from refeeding syndrome, a condition that occurs when a severely malnourished patient is fed too quickly. The rapid increase in glucose causes insulin secretion, which drives intracellular uptake of glucose, phosphate, and potassium. Hypophosphatemia can lead to weakness and respiratory muscle failure, while hypokalemia can affect the cardiovascular system. Initiating TPN slowly can prevent refeeding syndrome. Enteral nutrition may also be helpful, but the patient was intubated and sedated, making enteral nutrition difficult to administer. Furosemide is a diuretic and would not address the underlying electrolyte imbalances. Low-sugar TPN would not prevent refeeding syndrome."
