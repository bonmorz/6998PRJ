The findings of significant pitting edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and laboratory results (low albumin, elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine, and a large amount of protein and RBC in the urine, with many RBC casts) suggest the most likely diagnosis is AL amyloidosis. The echocardiography shows that there is a diastolic dysfunction in his heart, which is common with AL amyloidosis.

The significant pitting edema and liver and spleen enlargement are common symptoms of this disease. The elevated serum cholesterol and triglycerides, and decreased albumin levels are consistent with amyloid deposition affecting the liver.
