The persistent breech presentation increases the risk of complications during delivery, so either Cesarean section or external cephalic version (ECV) is recommended. As the patient wishes to attempt a vaginal delivery, ECV is the most appropriate next step in management. It involves an attempt to turn the fetus within the uterus to a cephalic presentation by external manipulation. Repeat ultrasound or observing until spontaneous labor may not change the presentation, and Cesarean section is not indicated unless there are other complications."
