The patient presents with vaginal bleeding during pregnancy and a history of cesarean delivery, which increases the risk of placenta previa.

Partial covering of the internal cervical os by the placental edge is the characteristic finding in placenta previa. Retroplacental blood accumulation and placental calcification are not specific to this condition, and cysts on the placental surface are not a normal finding."

In this case, information about the patient's previous cesarean delivery and smoking history is not relevant to the answer. The lack of abdominal tenderness or palpable uterine contractions suggests that there is no active labor, while the passage of blood suggests that there is placental bleeding. Among the options, partial covering of the internal cervical os by the placental edge is the most likely finding on ultrasound examination in this case.
