The scenario in option (D) is an example of reaction formation, where a person may present the opposite of their true feelings or thoughts as a way to cope with them. The man makes a joke about being half the man his wife knew as a way to cope with the loss of his testicle. Similarly, in option (A), the woman may be using reaction formation to cope with her own homosexual desires by speaking out against them. Option (B) is an example of displacement, where anger is directed toward a safer target. Option (C) is an example of sublimation, where negative feelings are converted into a socially acceptable behavior, like exercising."

Option A is an example of reaction formation, where the individual expresses unacceptable feelings by demonstrating the opposite behavior. Option B is an example of displacement, where the individual takes out their anger on someone else unrelated to the situation. Option C is an example of sublimation, where the individual channels their unacceptable impulses into a more socially acceptable behavior."
