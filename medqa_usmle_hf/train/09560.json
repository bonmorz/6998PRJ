The administration of normal saline is expected to restore fluid and electrolyte balance, which can lead to an increase in pH and HCO3-. The expected ABG results are a pH of 7.48, pCO2 of 44 mm Hg, and HCO3- of 29 mEq/L (Option C). Option A has a normal pH with slightly increased pCO2 and decreased HCO3-. Option B has decreased pH, normal pCO2, and decreased HCO3-, which suggests metabolic acidosis. Option D has increased pH, decreased pCO2, and very low HCO3-, which suggests respiratory alkalosis along with metabolic acidosis."
