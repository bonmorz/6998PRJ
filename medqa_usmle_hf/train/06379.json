The question stem describes an absent gag reflex on the right side and decreased ability to detect sour and bitter substances on the right posterior tongue, which suggests impairment of cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal nerve). This nerve also provides parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland, making option (A) the correct answer. The glossopharyngeal nerve does not provide parasympathetic innervation to the submandibular gland (option B), nor does it provide parasympathetic innervation to the trachea (option C) or somatic sensory innervation to the lower lip (option D)."

Based on the symptoms, the nerve responsible for taste sensation on the right posterior tongue is the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), which also provides parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland. Option (B) is incorrect because submandibular gland is innervated by the submandibular ganglion which is supplied by the chorda tympani branch of CN VII.

The question is asking for the nerve responsible for the patient\u2019s loss of taste sensation, so we need to identify which nerve innervates the posterior tongue. The options provided include nerves that innervate other structures. The correct answer is the nerve that innervates the parotid gland, as it also innervates the posterior third of the tongue, which is responsible for sour and bitter tastes. Therefore, the correct answer is (A), parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland."
