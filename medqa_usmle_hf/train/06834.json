The patient's history of aspirin allergy suggests a non-immunological reaction to ketorolac, which is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). This type of reaction is called a pseudoallergic reaction and can cause bronchospasm and wheezing. Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction and Prinzmetal angina both present with wheezing and chest tightness, but the patient's history and current medication use makes these less likely. Excessive beta-adrenergic blockade would not cause wheezing and decreased breath sounds."

The patient\u2019s history of aspirin allergy suggests a pseudoallergic reaction to the ketorolac she received for postoperative pain. The symptoms, including chest tightness and shortness of breath, are consistent with a pseudoallergic reaction. Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction usually involves an allergen and can cause similar symptoms, but there is no known allergen in this case. Prinzmetal angina typically causes chest pain without shortness of breath, and there is no evidence of ECG abnormalities. Excessive beta-adrenergic blockade would not cause these symptoms in this patient."

The patient's history of aspirin allergy suggests a possible pseudallergic reaction to the ketorolac that she received for postoperative pain. Flushed face, wheezes, and decreased breath sounds all suggest a possible allergic reaction, but since the patient has a history of allergy to aspirin, it's less likely to be a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction or Prinzmetal angina. Excessive beta-adrenergic blockade is also unlikely since the patient is taking metoprolol (a beta-blocker) for hypertension."

Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction is also a possibility, but there is no mention of previous exposure to any allergen. Prinzmetal angina is unlikely as the patient does not have any typical symptoms of angina, and the ECG is normal. Excessive beta-adrenergic blockade is also unlikely as the patient\u2019s daily medications include metoprolol, which is a beta-blocker, and she has not had any issues before the surgery."
