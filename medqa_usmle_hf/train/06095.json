The vitelline duct is responsible for transporting nutrients to the developing fetus during early embryonic development, and typically obliterates by the end of the 7th week. Partial obliteration can result in a variety of abnormalities, most commonly Meckel's diverticulum, which is a residual pouch that extends from the small intestine and contains gastric or pancreatic tissue. Meckel's diverticulum can cause bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract due to its gastric tissue, making option D the correct answer. Option A (swelling in genital region) is not associated with vitelline duct abnormalities. Option B (dilation of descending colon) is more commonly associated with Hirschsprung's disease. Option C (discharge of urine from umbilicus) is a result of patent urachus."
