The patient\u2019s history of hyperparathyroidism is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition, which is likely to be calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD), also known as pseudogout. CPPD occurs due to the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints and can cause sudden onset of joint pain, swelling, and limited mobility. The recent gastrointestinal infection may be a trigger for CPPD, but it is not the strongest predisposing factor in this case. Local skin abrasion and dyslipidemia are not associated with CPPD."
