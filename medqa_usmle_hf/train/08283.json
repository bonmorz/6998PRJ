This study is a retrospective cohort study because the investigators identify patients with and without a specific risk factor (cocaine use) and follow them over time to determine whether they develop the outcome of interest (syphilis infection). A case series involves the description of a group of patients with a particular disease or condition, rather than comparing two groups. A case-control study involves identifying patients with a particular outcome (syphilis) and comparing them to controls without the outcome, to determine potential risk factors. A meta-analysis involves pooling data from multiple studies to draw overall conclusions."

This is a retrospective cohort study as the investigators followed up with two groups of patients (cocaine users and non-users) to determine if the exposure (active cocaine use) is associated with the outcome (developing syphilis). A case series is a report of a series of patients with a particular disease or condition, rather than a comparison with a control group. A case-control study compares patients with a particular condition to a control group without the condition, and a meta-analysis is a statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple studies."

It is not a meta-analysis because it does not combine and analyze data from multiple studies, nor is it a case series because it does not describe a group of patients with a particular disease without a comparison group.
