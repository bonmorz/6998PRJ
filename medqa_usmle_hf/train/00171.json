Open surgical repair is the most appropriate next step in management, as it is the most effective treatment for inguinal hernias. Antibiotic therapy is not necessary unless there is evidence of infection. Surgical exploration of the testicle is unnecessary in this case as the pain and swelling are located in the groin area. Laparoscopic surgical repair may be considered but is not the most appropriate next step in management."

The most likely diagnosis is an incarcerated inguinal hernia based on the history and physical examination findings of a tender bulge in the left groin that does not reduce with lying down or external pressure. Given the patient's discomfort and the risk of strangulation, the most appropriate next step in management is open surgical repair to reduce the hernia and repair the defect. Antibiotics or surgical exploration of the testicle are not indicated in this case. Laparoscopic surgical repair may be an option, but open surgical repair is typically preferred in cases of incarcerated hernias."
