The bronchial arteries are most commonly supplied by the thoracic aorta, and the posterior intercostal arteries branch from the thoracic aorta and supply the posterior intercostal muscles, vertebrae, and spinal cord. Hence, the correct subsequent order of the catheter route would be thoracic aorta, right posterior intercostal artery (to reach the bronchial artery). Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they do not include the posterior intercostal artery, or they involve arteries that do not supply the bronchial artery."
