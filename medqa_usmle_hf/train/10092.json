The symptoms, especially the foul-smelling diarrhea, and the fact that he collected water from a stream, suggest the possibility of giardiasis.

Traveler\u2019s diarrhea due to Norovirus can cause diarrhea but not the foul-smelling diarrhea seen in this case. Irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic condition and does not cause sudden onset of symptoms like in this case."
