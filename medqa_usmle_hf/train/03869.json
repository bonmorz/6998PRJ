The first-line medication for UC is typically a 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) derivative such as mesalamine. These drugs act by inhibiting leukotriene synthesis and lipoxygenase, which in turn reduces inflammation in the colon. Option B (suppression of cellular and humoral immunity) may be used in more severe cases of UC, but it is not typically recommended as first-line treatment. Option C (inhibition of enzyme phospholipase A2) is a mechanism of action for corticosteroids, which may be used in more severe cases of UC, but again, is not typically first-line. Option D (cross-linking of DNA of the bacteria causing UC) is not a mechanism of action for any drug used in the treatment of UC."
