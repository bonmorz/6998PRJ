The symptoms, especially the distended neck veins, cool extremities, and cyanotic skin, suggest a decrease in cardiac output. Coarse crackles throughout both lung bases suggest fluid buildup in the lungs, which can be caused by heart failure. Therefore, the best answer is cardiac pump dysfunction. Loss of intravascular volume and failure of vasoregulation can also cause hypotension but they would not cause the other symptoms described in the question. Barrier to cardiac flow is not a recognized mechanism of any medical condition."
