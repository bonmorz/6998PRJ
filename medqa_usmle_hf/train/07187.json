However, his lack of pain upon palpation or passive range of motion suggests a possible underlying systemic issue such as osteoarthritis or gout. As such, the best initial step in management would be weight loss, which can help alleviate pressure on the knee joint and potentially address any underlying systemic issue. Aspirin and colchicine are medications used to treat pain and inflammation in gout, but given the lack of a definitive diagnosis, neither is indicated at this time. An MRI may be helpful in diagnosing specific knee issues, but it is not the best initial step in management."
