The most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to check the patient\u2019s thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, as hyperthyroidism can cause thyroid nodules. If the TSH level is normal or low, a fine needle aspiration biopsy may be necessary to determine if the nodule is cancerous or benign. CT of the neck is not necessary at this point, as ultrasound is usually the first imaging test for thyroid nodules. Open biopsy is not necessary without first attempting less invasive diagnostic procedures."
