Euchromatin, which refers to loosely packed chromatin that is actively involved in gene transcription and replication, is associated with increased cellular proliferation and a higher potential for malignancy. This is because cancer cells often have alterations in their chromatin structure that promote uncontrolled cell division and growth. Nucleosomes, H1 protein, and methylated DNA are also important components of chromatin structure and function, but are not specifically associated with an increased potential for malignancy."
