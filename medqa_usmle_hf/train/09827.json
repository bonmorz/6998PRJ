The history of smoking increases the risk for thromboembolism, and the chest CT scan showing a wedged-shaped, pleura-based triangular area of hemorrhage in the right lower lobe is most indicative of embolism. Pulmonary atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis are not typically associated with acute symptoms such as those described here."

The sudden onset of chest pain and breathlessness, along with a history of smoking and recent surgery, suggests the most probable cause of the pulmonary lesion is embolism. Thrombosis would be a possible cause but it is less likely because the chest pain increases with deep inspiration, indicating pleuritic chest pain, which is associated with embolism. Pulmonary atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis may cause chronic lung disease but they do not present with acute symptoms like chest pain and breathlessness."
