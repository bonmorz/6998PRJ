The next step in evaluation should be a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. This test will help determine whether the patient's adrenal glands are overproducing cortisol, or if the problem is due to excess pituitary ACTH secretion or an adrenal tumor. MRI of the head with contrast and ACTH measurement in the inferior petrosal sinuses may also be indicated if the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test results are inconclusive. CT scan of the abdomen with contrast is not indicated as the patient already has evidence of elevated cortisol levels, which can be caused by adrenal tumor or excess production of ACTH."

The patient presents with symptoms of Cushing syndrome, including weight gain, weakness, irregular menstrual cycles, insomnia, and depression. She also has hypertension, a plethoric face, central obesity, and violaceous linear striations on her lower abdomen. Two midnight serum cortisol studies and a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement indicate that her cortisol levels are elevated. Elevated serum ACTH levels suggest that the cause of her Cushing syndrome is either ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. The next step in the evaluation should be a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test, which can help determine if the Cushing syndrome is ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent."

The patient is likely suffering from Cushing's syndrome, with symptoms such as weight gain, weakness, irregular menstrual cycles, insomnia, and depression. The elevated cortisol levels in 2 midnight serum tests and a 24-hour urinary cortisol measurement confirm this. Serum ACTH levels are also elevated, suggesting either ACTH-dependent or independent causes. A high-dose dexamethasone suppression test can differentiate between these causes and determine the origin of hypercortisolism. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in evaluation is a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test."
