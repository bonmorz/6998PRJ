The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 72 fL suggests microcytic anemia, which is commonly due to iron deficiency. However, the lack of response to oral iron supplementation suggests possible poor absorption. Supplementing with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) can enhance intestinal absorption of iron, which can improve the patient\u2019s condition. Transfusion of whole blood is not the first-line treatment for this patient\u2019s anemia. Omeprazole is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease and is not helpful in treating anemia. Intravenous iron is reserved for patients with severe iron deficiency anemia or those who have failed oral iron supplementation."

The patient's laboratory results show microcytic anemia and thrombocytosis, which can be seen in iron deficiency anemia. Despite starting oral ferrous sulfate supplements, there has been no interval change in the MCV or platelet level. Supplementing with ascorbic acid can help increase the absorption of iron and improve the response to oral iron therapy. Option A is not necessary as the patient is not severely anemic. Option C is not necessary as omeprazole is used to suppress gastric acid secretion and does not aid in the absorption of iron. IV iron administration is usually reserved for patients who cannot tolerate oral therapy or who have severe iron deficiency anemia."
