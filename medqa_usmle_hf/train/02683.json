The ST elevations in leads II, III, and avF indicate inferior wall myocardial infarction, while the ST elevations in leads V5-V6 indicate involvement of the lateral wall. The lateral wall of the left ventricle is supplied by the left circumflex coronary artery, making option B the correct answer.

ST elevations in leads V5-V6 are most indicative of pathology in the lateral wall of left ventricle, which is usually supplied by the left circumflex coronary artery. Option A is associated with ST elevations in the anterior leads, which would suggest an occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Option C is incorrect because the left atrium is not supplied by a coronary artery. Option D is incorrect because the right ventricle is not usually supplied by the left main coronary artery."
