The patient\u2019s history and physical examination suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the chest radiograph shows evidence of diffuse emphysema. The complete blood count shows leukocytosis, and the liver function tests are abnormal. The serum protein electrophoresis shows a low alpha-1 globulin fraction. These findings are consistent with alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, which is an inherited condition that can cause COPD and liver disease. Cystic fibrosis and chronic granulomatous disease present with similar symptoms, but the sweat chloride test and nitro tetrazolium test are normal in this patient, making these diagnoses less likely. Wilson\u2019s disease usually presents with neurological symptoms, which are not present in this patient."
