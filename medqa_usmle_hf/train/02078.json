The symptoms suggest a bleeding disorder, and the inability of the blood to clot even with the addition of normal plasma suggests a deficiency in factor VIII or IX, which are autosomal recessive disorders. X-linked dominant and recessive disorders affect males more severely than females, so they are less likely to be the mode of transmission in this case. Mitochondrial transmission is associated with certain types of genetic disorders, but not with bleeding disorders."

VWD is often inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern. X-linked dominant and recessive patterns are less likely to be the cause in this patient, as they mostly affect males and there is no indication of a family history. Mitochondrial inheritance is also less likely in this case, as it is usually associated with metabolic disorders and not bleeding disorders. The lack of response to adding normal plasma also supports a diagnosis of VWD, as this would be expected to correct the bleeding if the patient had a clotting factor deficiency."
