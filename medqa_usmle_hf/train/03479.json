The patient is exhibiting perfectionist tendencies that are causing distress in her work life, but she is not aware of it and sees it as a positive thing.

Ego-dystonic OCD is when the patient is aware of their obsessive thoughts and compulsions and finds them distressing."

The patient's behavior suggests an obsession with work and a need for control, which fits the criteria for ego-syntonic obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Ego-syntonic OCD would involve obsessions and compulsions that the patient feels are in-line with their personality, while ego-dystonic OCD would involve obsessions and compulsions that the patient sees as unwanted and intrusive. The last option is too general and does not provide a specific diagnosis."
