The vertebral burst fracture at the level of T11 may cause damage to the spinothalamic tract, which carries pain and temperature sensation. This may result in impaired pain and temperature sensation up to T10-T11. However, the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway, which carries fine touch and vibration sense, usually remains intact in these types of injuries. Therefore, preserved fine touch is the most likely finding in this patient. Hyperreflexia and bladder dysfunction are associated with upper motor neuron lesions, which are not present in this case."

The impairment of pain and temperature sensation up to T10-T11 further reinforces this conclusion. Crude touch is carried by the spinothalamic pathway, which is separate from the fine touch pathway. Hyperreflexia and bladder dysfunction are more commonly associated with spinal cord injuries at thoracic and cervical levels."

Crude touch and pain sensation are carried by the spinothalamic tracts, which are more anterior. Hyperreflexia is a characteristic feature of spinal cord injury above the level of the lesion, and bladder dysfunction is common in spinal cord injury involving the lower part of the spinal cord."

Fine touch and proprioception fibers from the periphery enter the spinal cord dorsal column medial lemniscus pathway on the same side, so it's likely they are preserved here. Crude touch, pain, and temperature travel up the spinothalamic tract and cross over to the opposite side, so they would be impaired.
