Flecainide is a Class IC antiarrhythmic agent, which blocks sodium channels and has a use-dependent effect, meaning that it has greater efficacy at higher heart rates. Therefore, it is the most likely medication to be used for cardioversion in this case. Amiodarone is a Class III antiarrhythmic agent, which blocks potassium channels and has a slower onset of action. Propranolol and Verapamil are beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, respectively, which are not typically used for cardioversion of supraventricular tachycardia."
