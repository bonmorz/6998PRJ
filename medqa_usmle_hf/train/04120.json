The symptoms suggest separation anxiety disorder, as the child has trouble sleeping alone and cries when the mother steps out of the room. Abdominal pain every weekday morning also suggests anxiety related to school. The absence of fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or weight loss rules out irritable bowel syndrome. Conduct disorder is usually associated with aggressive and antisocial behavior, which is not evident in this case. Acute stress disorder usually occurs after a traumatic event, which is not reported in this case."

The symptoms, such as crampy abdominal pain and trouble sleeping, suggest that the most likely diagnosis is separation anxiety disorder. The fact that the patient started attending a new school 7 months ago and wants to sleep in the same room as his parents further supports this diagnosis.

The symptoms of abdominal pain and trouble sleeping, especially before school days, and the attachment behavior to the mother suggest the most likely diagnosis is separation anxiety disorder.

Acute stress disorder is characterized by anxiety and dissociative symptoms following a traumatic event."
