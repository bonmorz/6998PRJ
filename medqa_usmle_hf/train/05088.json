The ultrasound findings of echogenic medullary pyramids with dense echogenic foci and posterior acoustic shadows are consistent with nephrocalcinosis. Nephrocalcinosis can be caused by a variety of factors, but the answer options suggest that the correct answer is a developmental anomaly characterized by cystic dilatation of the collecting tubules in the renal pyramids. None of the other answer options are associated with this pathogenesis."
