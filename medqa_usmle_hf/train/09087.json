Incidence refers to the number of new cases of a disease in a population during a specified time period, while prevalence refers to the total number of cases of a disease in a population at a given time point. Prospective cohort studies are the best for assessing incidence, as they follow a group of people over time and record new cases as they occur. Cross sectional studies are the best for assessing prevalence, as they take a snapshot of the population and record the number of cases at a given time point. Therefore, option D, a prospective cohort study for incidence and a cross sectional study for prevalence, is the best pair of studies for this scenario."
