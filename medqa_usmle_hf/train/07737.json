In males, invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type, not lobular. The presence of axillary nodes suggests malignancy. Breast cancer in males is usually positive for estrogen receptor, so option (B) is true. BRCA analysis may be recommended in his family members to assess their risk. Endocrine therapy, such as tamoxifen, may have a role in treatment depending on the estrogen receptor status of the tumor."
