The patient is experiencing tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which is a potential complication of cancer therapy that results in the release of intracellular components and electrolytes from dying tumor cells. Among the options, only Allopurinol is used to prevent TLS-related hyperuricemia and reduce the risk of renal damage. It acts by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, an enzyme that converts purines to uric acid. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic used to treat infections, and sodium bicarbonate is used to correct metabolic acidosis. No prevention would not have been effective in this case."
