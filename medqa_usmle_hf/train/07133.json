The characteristic findings of this case include low hemoglobin, low MCV, normal or increased iron stores, and a family history of anemia. Sideroblastic anemia is the only option that fits all of these criteria. Anemia of chronic disease typically has low iron stores, while hemochromatosis usually presents with high iron stores.

This rules out anemia of chronic disease and myelodysplastic syndrome. Hemochromatosis typically presents with organ damage and the patient denies typical symptoms. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is sideroblastic anemia, which is characterized by impaired heme synthesis leading to abnormal iron utilization and buildup in red blood cells. The family history of anemia is also suggestive of a genetic component."

Anemia of chronic disease is typically normocytic, and myelodysplastic syndrome usually presents in older adults.
