Tense fontanelles and optic disc swelling suggest increased intracranial pressure. Epidural hematoma is usually caused by a skull fracture and would have a localizing neurological deficit. Bacterial meningitis and periventricular hemorrhage would not cause the discoloration or fontanelle findings."

The symptoms of difficulty feeding, decreased arousability, and tense fontanelles suggest increased intracranial pressure. Bilateral optic disc swelling indicates papilledema, which is frequently found in cases of subdural hematoma. The purple discoloration in the T4-T10 dermatomes bilaterally suggests spinal cord injury. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is subdural hematoma. Epidural hematoma typically presents with a brief loss of consciousness followed by a lucid period, then rapid deterioration. Bacterial meningitis typically presents with fever, headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia. Periventricular hemorrhage is a complication of premature birth and is unlikely in a 2-month-old."
