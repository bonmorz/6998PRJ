The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a possible renal or ureteral stone, such as right-lower quadrant and right flank pain, but also has an irregularly irregular heart rhythm and bruising over the right flank. The history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, as well as the patient's medication list, suggest a risk for thromboembolism. Given the patient's unstable vital signs and potential for a thromboembolic event, a CT abdomen/pelvis would be most useful to help confirm the diagnosis and guide management. Ultrasound or radiographs may not provide enough detail, while an MRI may not be feasible in an emergency setting."
