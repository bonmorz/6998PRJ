The patient\u2019s symptoms, including carpopedal spasm, prolonged QT interval, and low serum calcium, as well as his chronic cough, suggest destruction of the parathyroid glands. This could be due to chronic hypoparathyroidism from radiation or surgical resection. Multiple endocrine neoplasia and ectopic hormone production are less likely causes, and vitamin D deficiency would not cause carpopedal spasm or a prolonged QT interval."

The patient's presentation is consistent with hypoparathyroidism, which is commonly caused by the destruction of parathyroid glands.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia and ectopic hormone production may also cause abnormal hormone levels, but they are less likely given the patient's history and laboratory results. Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to hypocalcemia, but it is not the underlying cause in this case."

The most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms is destruction of parathyroid glands, leading to hypoparathyroidism.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia and ectopic hormone production are less likely causes, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with them. Vitamin D deficiency can also lead to hypocalcemia, but is less likely given the patient's lack of risk factors for deficiency and normal serum alkaline phosphatase activity."
