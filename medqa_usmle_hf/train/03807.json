Acute hypomagnesemia can also cause decreased neuronal excitability, but the symptoms presented in the question are more indicative of hypocalcemia. Acute hypernatremia and acute hypochloremia are not typically associated with decreased neuronal excitability."

The symptoms suggest that the man has hypocalcemia, which can cause generalized decreased neuronal excitability leading to muscle weakness and depressed reflexes. Therefore, the correct answer is not hypercalcemia but rather acute hypocalcemia. Among the given options, acute hypercalcemia can actually cause muscle weakness but it does so through a different mechanism, by impairing muscle contraction. The other options are not listed as common causes of decreased neuronal excitability."
