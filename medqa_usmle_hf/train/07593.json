Therefore, the next step in diagnosis would be a serum blood test to measure levels of aortic aneurysm markers such as fibrillin-1 or TGF-beta. A chest radiograph could help rule out other possible causes of chest pain and shortness of breath but is not the most specific test for Marfan syndrome. An angiogram would be invasive and not necessary at this point. An electrocardiogram would not be specific for Marfan syndrome."
