The patient has a history of schizophrenia and was given IM haloperidol, which is used to treat acute agitation in schizophrenic patients.

However, both haloperidol and fluphenazine can cause hypothermia, which may have contributed to the patient's presentation with a low body temperature. Lithium can cause hypothermia as well, but it is not a typical medication for schizophrenia. Fluoxetine and valproic acid are not known to cause hypothermia."
