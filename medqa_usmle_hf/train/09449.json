The incubated leukocyte test confirms a diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which is caused by a defective respiratory burst in phagocytes due to mutations in genes coding for the subunits of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase (NADPH-oxidase) enzyme. The NADPH-oxidase enzyme generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that kill pathogens engulfed by phagocytes. The HMP shunt pathway generates NADPH, which is needed to activate NADPH-oxidase.
