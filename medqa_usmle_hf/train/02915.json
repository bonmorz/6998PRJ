HPV-2 infection may cause genital warts but is not typically associated with dry, scaly lesions on the elbows. Malassezia furfur infection may cause pityriasis versicolor, but this typically presents with small, scaly, hypopigmented or hyperpigmented lesions on the trunk. Neoplastic T-cell infiltration may present with skin lesions but is less likely in a patient with controlled HIV infection and a high CD4+ T-lymphocyte count."
