The presence of thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT and aPTT, and bleeding suggests a coagulation disorder in this preterm neonate. Fibrinogen levels in preterm infants born at 32 weeks of gestation are typically low, not normal as compared to an adult. An extremely premature infant has low levels of protein C, not markedly elevated levels. Antithrombin III levels are low in neonates, not increased. Vitamin K administration to the mother during labor results in a reduction in bleeding, not widespread subcutaneous ecchymosis."

In preterm neonates, serum levels of fibrinogen are typically lower than in full-term neonates, which can lead to bleeding tendencies. Protein C levels are decreased in preterm neonates, not elevated. Antithrombin III levels are lower in neonates than in adults. Administration of vitamin K to the mother during labor helps prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, not widespread subcutaneous ecchymosis. Therefore, the correct statement is that serum levels of fibrinogen in a preterm infant born at 32 weeks of gestation are typically normal, as compared to an adult. The thrombocytopenia and prolonged clotting times suggest coagulation dysfunction, which is common in preterm neonates due to immature coagulation systems."

Option D is incorrect as the administration of vitamin K to the mother during labor helps prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, but does not necessarily prevent widespread subcutaneous ecchymosis in premature infants."
