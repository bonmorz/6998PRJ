The patient\u2019s symptoms, including severe back pain that shoots down the leg, decreased sensation at the knee, and a positive straight leg test are consistent with a disc herniation. The nerve root involved is most likely the L3 or L4 nerve root, making option A the correct answer. Option B is less likely due to the absence of weakness or weight loss. Option C is less likely given the sudden onset and absence of other systemic symptoms, and option D is less likely given the absence of vertebral step-offs on examination."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including sharp back pain that shoots down the lateral thigh and positive straight leg test, suggest a disc herniation. The location of the herniation is likely at the L3/L4 vertebrae based on the decreased sensation at the left knee and decreased patellar reflex. Smoking and family history of osteoporosis may contribute to the development of herniated discs. Spinal metastasis and vertebral compression fracture would present differently with other symptoms such as weight loss, weakness, and saddle anesthesia."

The patient\u2019s symptoms of back pain and shooting pain down the leg, along with a positive straight leg test, suggest a disc herniation. The location of the herniation can be determined by the dermatomal distribution of the pain, which in this case suggests L3/L4 vertebra. The family history of osteoporosis and smoking history increase the risk for vertebral compression fracture, but there are no vertebral step-offs detected on examination, ruling out that possibility. Spinal metastasis is less likely given the patient\u2019s lack of weight loss or other systemic symptoms."

The patient\u2019s symptoms point towards a lower lumbar nerve root compression, which is often caused by a herniation of the intervertebral disc. The positive straight leg test is also indicative of this. Of the options, only (A) disc herniation at the L3/L4 vertebra and (B) disc herniation at the L4/L5 vertebra can cause lower lumbar nerve root compression, but since the pain shoots down the lateral thigh, it is more likely to be at the L3/L4 level. The lack of weight loss, weakness, or incontinence makes spinal metastasis from lung cancer less likely. Although osteoporosis can predispose a person to vertebral compression fracture, the lack of vertebral step-offs makes it less likely."

Option (B) is also a possibility, but the patient\u2019s symptoms do not seem to fit L4/L5 radiculopathy as well as L3/L4.
