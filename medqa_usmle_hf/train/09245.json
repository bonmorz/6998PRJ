The symptoms suggest compression of the common peroneal nerve, which can occur due to prolonged labor and/or the positioning of the legs during delivery. Epidural anesthesia can cause these symptoms, but typically resolves within 4-6 hours after delivery. Postpartum angiopathy is a rare condition that can cause neurological symptoms, but typically presents with seizures and/or headache. Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injury typically presents with numbness and pain over the lateral thigh, and not weakness and numbness of the foot as seen in this patient."

The use of epidural anesthesia during delivery can cause nerve damage, but the location of the symptoms, namely the high-stepping gait and weakness of right foot dorsiflexion and right ankle eversion, point towards the common peroneal nerve. Postpartum angiopathy and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injury are not likely causes of these symptoms."

The symptoms suggest a common peroneal nerve injury, which can occur due to compression during childbirth, especially in cases of prolonged labor and epidural anesthesia. Postpartum angiopathy can cause ischemic strokes but the symptoms do not match. Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve can cause meralgia paresthetica but does not match the weakness and foot drop. The effects of epidural anesthesia should have resolved by this point in time."
