The pain when her left hip is passively extended suggests psoas muscle involvement. The presence of diabetes mellitus also predisposes the patient to psoas muscle abscess. The absence of abnormalities on abdominal ultrasound rules out nephrolithiasis and uterine leiomyoma. Ectopic pregnancy is unlikely given the negative urine pregnancy test."

The patient has left flank pain, increased urinary frequency, and tenderness in the left lower quadrant, which suggests a possible psoas muscle abscess. The fact that there is tenderness when the left hip is passively extended is also indicative of a psoas abscess. The patient's poorly controlled diabetes might be related to this as it increases the risk of infections. The fact that there is 3+ glucose in her urine also supports the diagnosis of a possible abscess. Ultrasound may not be sufficient to detect a psoas abscess, so further imaging studies such as CT or MRI may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Ectopic pregnancy, nephrolithiasis, and uterine leiomyoma are less likely given the patient's symptoms and findings on physical exam."
