The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest meningitis, which can be caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Neisseria meningitidis. Ampicillin is effective against Listeria monocytogenes and is often added to empiric therapy in patients with suspected meningitis, especially in older adults and immunocompromised patients. Clindamycin is not a good choice for meningitis treatment. TMP-SMX is not effective against Listeria monocytogenes and may not be appropriate as a first-line therapy. Meropenem is effective against many bacteria but is not a first-line choice for suspected meningitis."

The patient's history of colorectal cancer makes him susceptible to Listeria meningitis, which is treated with ampicillin in addition to ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. Clindamycin and TMP-SMX are not typically used as first-line therapy for bacterial meningitis, and meropenem may be a second-line or adjunctive option, but not the initial choice."
