The expected change in resistance to blood flow through a stenotic artery is proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the stenosis. Therefore, a 50% stenosis (reducing the radius to half) will increase the resistance to blood flow 16 times greater. This increased resistance can lead to ischemia and subsequent symptoms in the affected area, such as the right-sided weakness and decreased sensation described in the case."

The question is asking about the expected change in resistance to blood flow through the stenotic artery, and the answer is related to the degree of stenosis. The left internal carotid artery has 50% stenosis, which means the area of the stenosis is only half the original area. Therefore, the resistance to blood flow would be 16 times greater (1/0.5^4) due to the decreased area of the stenosis. This increased resistance can lead to ischemic events like the patient experienced."
