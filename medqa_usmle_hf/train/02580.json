Bupropion is an antidepressant that is not typically used for anxiety disorders. Buspirone is an anxiolytic medication that is not FDA-approved to treat PTSD. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that is sometimes used to treat anxiety and PTSD but should not be the best initial therapy due to its risks of dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal."
