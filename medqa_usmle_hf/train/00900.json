The patient\u2019s symptoms of pelvic and back pain accompanied by painful diarrhea, and the fact that naproxen provides some relief suggests that the most likely cause is endometriosis, where endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus. This can cause infertility due to various reasons including fallopian tube blockage, but the hysterosalpingogram is unremarkable, ruling out answer (D). Answer (B) is incorrect because smooth muscle tumors arising from the myometrium (fibroids) do not typically cause pain, and answer (C) is incorrect because primary ovarian failure would not cause the patient\u2019s other symptoms."
