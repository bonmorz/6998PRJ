Nitroglycerin works by decreasing preload (volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole), which ultimately decreases end-diastolic pressure. Venous pooling is not relevant in this scenario. Coronary arterial vasodilation and increased plaque stability are both effects of long-term nitroglycerin use rather than short-term relief of chest pain."

The fact that sublingual nitroglycerin helps relieve the chest pain, combined with the patient\u2019s history of similar episodes, suggests that the patient has stable angina.

The fact that sublingual nitroglycerin helps relieve the patient\u2019s pain suggests that the cause of chest pain is likely related to decreased blood supply to the heart, i.e. ischemia. Decreasing end-diastolic pressure, or preload, can help reduce the workload of the heart and improve blood flow to the coronary arteries, thus improving symptoms of chest pain. Decreased venous pooling and coronary arterial vasodilation can also help improve blood flow but are not the primary mechanisms by which nitroglycerin and other nitrates relieve chest pain. Increased atherosclerotic plaque stability may be beneficial in the long-term management of coronary artery disease, but is not likely to provide immediate relief of chest pain."
