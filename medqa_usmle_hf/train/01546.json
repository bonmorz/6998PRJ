The nerve can be injured by an intramuscular injection in the superomedial quadrant of the buttock, which is the most likely location of the injection in this case."

The patient most likely received the intramuscular injection in the superomedial quadrant of the buttock, as this can injure the superior gluteal nerve, leading to a Trendelenburg gait with a dropping hip on the affected side. Anteromedial thigh injection can damage the femoral nerve, leading to weakness of the quadriceps, while superolateral and inferolateral quadrant buttock injections can damage the sciatic nerve, leading to weakness and sensory loss in the lower leg and foot."
