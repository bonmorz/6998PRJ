The symptoms and echocardiogram findings suggest that the baby has a condition called truncus arteriosus, which occurs when the aorticopulmonary septum fails to form properly, and therefore blood from the left ventricle enters both the pulmonary and systemic circulation. This option is only available in answer choice (D). Closure of an aorticopulmonary shunt occurs normally in a fetal heart. Formation of the interatrial septum occurs after birth. Spiraling of the truncal and bulbar ridges is important for normal cardiac development, but does not explain the symptoms and echocardiogram findings seen in this case."
