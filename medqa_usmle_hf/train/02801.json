The most appropriate next step is laparotomy, surgical intervention to relieve the obstruction, and treat any underlying cause that caused the obstruction. Nasogastric and rectal tube insertion can help decompress the bowels, but it won't treat the cause of obstruction. Colonoscopy is not recommended in this emergent setting. Intravenous neostigmine therapy can also help decompress the bowels, but it is not appropriate in this case as the patient has signs of bowel ischemia which can be worsened by neostigmine."

The symptoms and tests suggest that the most likely diagnosis is postoperative paralytic ileus with cecal dilation, which can progress to bowel ischemia or perforation if left untreated. Nasogastric and rectal tube insertion would help relieve the bloating but not improve peristalsis. Colonoscopy is not indicated in the acute setting of a distended colon. Intravenous neostigmine therapy may increase gastrointestinal motility but carries the risk of bradycardia or arrhythmias, which should be monitored in a critical care setting. Laparotomy is the most appropriate next step to relieve the obstruction and assess for any ischemic segments of bowel that may require resection."
