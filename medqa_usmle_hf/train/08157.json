The sudden decrease in oxygen saturation, absence of breath sounds bilaterally, and inability to record CO2 waveform indicate a possible airway obstruction.

Exploratory laparotomy is not indicated as the patient's symptoms indicate an airway emergency rather than a surgical emergency. Cricothyrotomy is a surgical procedure and is not appropriate as first-line treatment for an airway obstruction. Norepinephrine is a vasopressor used to treat hypotension, but it is not appropriate as first-line treatment for an airway obstruction."
