Given the patient's history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and recent chemotherapy, he is at high risk for developing tumor lysis syndrome, which occurs when large amounts of malignant cells are destroyed rapidly, leading to metabolic derangements such as hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. These metabolic derangements can cause acute kidney injury and other complications. Mercaptoethane sulfonate is a drug that can be used to prevent tumor lysis syndrome by reducing uric acid levels and increasing urinary excretion of uric acid. Protamine sulfate is used to reverse the anticoagulant effects of heparin, which the patient is not currently taking. Ciprofloxacin is an antibacterial drug that would not be effective against the patient's current condition. Dexrazoxane is a drug used to reduce the incidence and severity of cardiotoxicity associated with anthracycline chemotherapy drugs, and would not be relevant to this patient."

The symptoms suggest that the patient has a urinary tract infection, which could have been prevented with prophylactic antibiotics. Among the options, only Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic. However, the patient's history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and deep vein thrombosis means that he is at high risk of developing blood clots, so low molecular weight heparin was already administered to prevent this. Protamine sulfate is used to reverse the effects of heparin, so it would not have prevented the current condition. Mercaptoethane sulfonate is a chelating agent used for heavy metal poisoning, and Dexrazoxane is used to prevent cardiotoxicity associated with certain chemotherapy drugs, so neither would be appropriate in this scenario."
