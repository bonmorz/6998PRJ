The symptoms described suggest the patient has Tourette's syndrome, which is characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements and vocalizations. Tourette's syndrome is often associated with excessive impulsivity and inattention, which could explain the patient's dropping grades and embarrassment in school. Feelings of persistent sadness and loss of interest suggest depression, chorea and hyperreflexia suggest Huntington's disease, and recurrent episodes of intense fear suggest panic disorder."
