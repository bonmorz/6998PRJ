The patient\u2019s history of frequent lung infections and current symptoms of hematuria and hemoptysis suggest the possibility of a pulmonary-renal syndrome. Among the given options, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is the most likely diagnosis, which is characterized by the formation of granulomas and necrosis in the respiratory system and systemic vasculitis leading to renal involvement. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level support the diagnosis of GPA. The spontaneous nosebleed further supports the diagnosis, as GPA is known to cause bleeding from the nasal mucosa. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy are typically associated with a recent infection or history of recurrent infections but do not present with hemoptysis. Goodpasture syndrome is associated with anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, which were not mentioned in the patient\u2019s history."

Hemoptysis and hematuria are common symptoms, and the disease can also cause pulmonary infiltrates and sinusitis. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy are both types of glomerulonephritis that can cause hematuria but are not associated with recurrent lung infections or nosebleeds.
