The question describes the mechanism of the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla, which is a part of the sympathetic nervous system. The only option related to the musculoskeletal system is NM receptors of the quadriceps femoris muscle, but muscarinic M2 receptors are involved in cardiac slowing and D2 receptors are involved in dopamine pathways. H2 receptors are involved in gastric acid secretion. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) NM receptors of the quadriceps femoris muscle, which are nicotinic receptors."
