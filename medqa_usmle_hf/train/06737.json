Infiltrating lobular carcinoma is typically hormone receptor-positive and HER2-positive and is typically treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Surgical resection alone is not sufficient as the cancer has already spread outside the breast. Radiotherapy alone is not sufficient as infiltrating lobular carcinoma is often multicentric and may involve multiple quadrants of the breast. Therefore, surgical resection and chemotherapy is the most appropriate management."

The fact that the mass is a lobular carcinoma and positive for estrogen and HER2 receptors suggest that surgical resection alone may not be enough.
