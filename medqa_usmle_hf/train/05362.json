The patient has a history of irregular periods and spotting, which may indicate anovulation or irregular shedding of the endometrial lining. A progesterone withdrawal test can help determine if the patient has adequate levels of progesterone to trigger shedding of the endometrial lining. Measurement of follicle-stimulating hormone can help determine if the patient has or is at risk for premature ovarian failure. Measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone can help determine if the patient has thyroid dysfunction, which can cause menstrual irregularities. Measurement of prolactin levels can help determine if the patient has hyperprolactinemia, which can also cause menstrual irregularities. However, given the patient's other symptoms, a progesterone withdrawal test would be the most appropriate first step."

The patient has irregular periods, spotting between periods, and no recent menstrual period, which suggests anovulation.

A progesterone withdrawal test can help determine if the patient is ovulating, as PCOS patients may have either delayed menstruation or amenorrhea due to a lack of ovulation. Measurement of follicle-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and prolactin levels are important in evaluating menstrual irregularities, but they are not as helpful in determining the cause in this patient with suspected PCOS."
