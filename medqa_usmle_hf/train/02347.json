Down syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality that is typically not related to maternal weight loss or use of laxatives. Bradycardia in newborns may be caused by a variety of factors, but there is no evidence to suggest a link to maternal history of laxative use. Anemia in newborns may be caused by maternal iron deficiency or other factors, but again there is no direct link to laxative use."
