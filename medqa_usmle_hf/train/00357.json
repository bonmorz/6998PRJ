The patient's presentation with generalized bone pain, sudden onset paralysis, and a compression fracture suggests metastatic disease. The elevated calcium level in the serum supports this as well. Proliferation of tumor cells is the most likely mechanism underlying this patient's vertebral fracture. Acidosis-induced bone lysis is not a typical mechanism of vertebral fracture, and increased osteoblastic activity would result in bone growth rather than fracture. Increased mechanical pressure can be a contributing factor, but it is not the most likely mechanism in this case."
