The patient presents with epigastric pain, sweating, and breathlessness for 45 minutes, and her blood gas analysis shows hypoxemia. Among the options, only increased pulmonary capillary pressure can cause pulmonary edema, which can cause hypoxemia. Increased permeability can also cause edema, but there is no evidence to suggest that in this case. Decreased transpulmonary pressure and decreased hemoglobin can lead to hypoxemia but are not the most likely causes in this scenario."
