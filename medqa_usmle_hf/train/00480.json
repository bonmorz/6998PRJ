The pitting ankle edema and gynecomastia also suggest that there is liver dysfunction present. Increased prothrombin time is the lab finding most likely to be seen in patients with liver dysfunction, as the liver plays a key role in producing factors that are necessary for blood clotting. Increased levels of antidepressants or bleeding time are unlikely to be related to the patient's symptoms. Increased d-dimer levels may indicate the presence of a blood clot, but this is not consistent with the patient's presentation."
