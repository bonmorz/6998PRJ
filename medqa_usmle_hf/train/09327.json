Serum CRP and ESR may be elevated in cases of bacterial infection, but they are not specific for streptococcal pharyngitis. Serology for IgM and IgG antibodies is not recommended for the acute diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis."

PCR may also be used to diagnose Streptococcus infection, but rapid antigen test is a faster and more cost-effective option. Serum CRP and ESR may be elevated in bacterial infections but are not specific to group A Streptococcus. Serology for IgM and IgG antibodies is not useful for acute diagnosis and is more appropriate for convalescent-phase testing."
