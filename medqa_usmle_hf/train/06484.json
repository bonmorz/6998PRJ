The feature of the electrocardiogram that represents initial ventricular depolarization is the Q wave, which is normally less than 40 milliseconds in duration. Therefore, option (C) is correct. Option (A) is incorrect because hypokalemia can lead to a prolonged QRS complex, not a prominent Q wave. Option (B) is incorrect because full thickness ischemic injury of the heart can lead to elevated ST segments on the electrocardiogram, not a prominent Q wave. Option (D) is incorrect because a normal QRS complex duration is less than 100 milliseconds, not less than 200 milliseconds."
