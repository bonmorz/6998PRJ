The external genitalia abnormalities, such as a shortened penis with an upward curve and dorsal urethral opening, are also consistent with bladder exstrophy. Cloacal exstrophy may present with similar findings, but it typically involves a more extensive defect involving the bladder, rectum, and external genitalia. Urachal cyst and posterior urethral valves are not associated with the described physical findings."

The presence of a triangular defect in the lower anterior abdominal wall, an open bladder plate with an exposed urethra, and an inguinal hernia in this newborn suggest the diagnosis of bladder exstrophy. The shortened penis and dorsal urethral opening further support this diagnosis. Posterior urethral valves usually present with signs of obstructive uropathy, and cloacal exstrophy presents with more extensive involvement of the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts. Urachal cyst presents as a cystic mass near the umbilicus."

The combination of an open bladder plate, exposed urethra, low set umbilicus, anteriorly displaced anus, and inguinal hernia suggest bladder exstrophy. The external genitalia abnormalities, such as a shortened penis with pronounced upward curvature and urethral opening along the dorsal surface, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Option (B) is incorrect because posterior urethral valves do not involve the bladder plate. Option (C) describes the exstrophy-epispadias complex, but the absence of hypoplastic penis and epispadias rules out this diagnosis. Option (A) is not related to the symptoms described."
