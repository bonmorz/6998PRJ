Option (B) suggests pancreatic cancer, but laboratory studies are normal. Option (C) suggests mesenteric ischemia, but there is no ischemia in laboratory tests. Option (D) suggests gastroparesis, but there is no mention of delayed emptying. Option (A) suggests narrowing of the celiac artery, which can cause mesenteric ischemia and lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain after eating and weight loss. The scaphoid abdomen and diffuse tenderness to palpation also support this diagnosis."
