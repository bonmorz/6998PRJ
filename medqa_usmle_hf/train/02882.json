Percutaneous nephrostomy is the most appropriate next step to relieve the obstruction and drain the infected urine. Ureteroscopy and stent placement, and shock wave lithotripsy may be options for treating the stone after the infection has resolved. Intravenous pyelography is not appropriate at this time."

The patient has signs and symptoms of acute pyelonephritis, as evidenced by fever, chills, leukocytosis, and costovertebral angle tenderness. The stone at the left ureteropelvic junction is likely causing the obstruction, leading to the pyelonephritis. Given the size of the stone and the presence of inflammation, the most appropriate next step in management would be percutaneous nephrostomy to drain the obstructed urine and relieve the pressure on the kidney. Ureteroscopy and stent placement or shock wave lithotripsy would be appropriate after the infection is treated and the patient is stable. Intravenous pyelography is not appropriate as it requires the administration of contrast dye, which can further damage the already compromised kidney."
