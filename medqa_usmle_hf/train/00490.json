The patient has symptoms of fever, chills, nausea, and left costovertebral angle tenderness, which are indicative of pyelonephritis. The urinalysis shows positive nitrites and leukocyte esterase, and many bacteria, which also suggest a urinary tract infection involving the kidneys. Uncomplicated cystitis is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and the presence of a urinary tract infection with kidney involvement. Acute obstructing nephrolithiasis would cause severe pain and is not supported by the patient's symptoms or the urinalysis results."

Uncomplicated cystitis usually presents with lower urinary tract symptoms only and does not involve the kidneys. Acute obstructing nephrolithiasis can also present with flank pain, but the urinalysis findings would be different (usually no bacteria or leukocytes present)."

The patient has symptoms of a UTI including fever, chills, and urinary urgency and frequency, and moderate costovertebral angle tenderness. The urinalysis further confirms the diagnosis as it shows positive nitrites, leukocyte esterase, and many bacteria. The elevated WBC count also suggests pyelonephritis, which is an infection in the kidneys. Uncomplicated cystitis and UTI are possible diagnoses, but the presence of costovertebral angle tenderness and elevated WBC count suggest pyelonephritis as the most likely diagnosis. Acute obstructing nephrolithiasis would cause severe pain and may be accompanied by nausea or vomiting, but there is no mention of these symptoms in the patient's history."
