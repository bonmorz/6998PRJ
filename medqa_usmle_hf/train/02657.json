The patient has treatment-resistant schizophrenia, which suggests the need for a more potent antipsychotic drug such as Clozapine.

Cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful but is not the first-line treatment for schizophrenia."

Clozapine is often considered as a third-line option for treating schizophrenia after other antipsychotic medications have failed to provide relief. It has been shown to be effective in patients who have treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Aripiprazole may also be effective, but clozapine is a better option in this scenario. Haloperidol is a first-generation antipsychotic and is not as effective as second-generation antipsychotics like clozapine. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful in addition to medication but is not typically used as a standalone treatment for schizophrenia."
