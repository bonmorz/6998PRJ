The worsening of symptoms with exertion and improvement with rest is a characteristic feature of myasthenia gravis. The drooping eyelid and weakness in the upper extremities are also commonly seen in this condition. Polymyositis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis do not typically present with double vision or drooping eyelids, and multiple sclerosis does not cause muscle weakness that improves with rest."

The symptoms and physical findings (double vision, weakness after exercise, drooping of eyelid, and worsened strength in upper extremities) all suggest myasthenia gravis, which is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission. Polymyositis presents as symmetric, proximal muscle weakness. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis presents with both upper and lower motor neuron signs. Multiple sclerosis can cause optic neuritis, but it usually presents with other neurologic symptoms such as sensory deficits or ataxia."

The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with myasthenia gravis, which is characterized by muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest. The drooping of the right upper eyelid (ptosis) is a classic sign of myasthenia gravis, as is weakness in the upper extremities. The other options are less likely given the patient's symptoms. Polymyositis typically involves muscle pain and stiffness, but not ptosis or fluctuating weakness. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by progressive muscle weakness that affects both upper and lower extremities; unilateral ptosis would be an unusual presentation. Multiple sclerosis (MS) can cause weakness and double vision, but would not cause the fluctuating weakness seen in myasthenia gravis."
