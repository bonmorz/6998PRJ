The symptoms suggest hypocalcemia, which is common after thyroidectomy due to accidental ligation of the parathyroid glands. Muscle spasm is a sign of hypocalcemia. Thus, the next best step in management would be calcium replacement therapy. Option A, Propylthiouracil, is used for hyperthyroidism. Option B, Magnesium replacement, may be helpful in hypomagnesemia but does not address hypocalcemia. Option C, Albumin infusion, may be helpful in low albumin due to malnutrition but does not address hypocalcemia."
