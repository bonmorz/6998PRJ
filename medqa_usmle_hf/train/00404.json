The presentation of high blood pressure in the upper extremity, weak femoral pulses, and a systolic murmur with a systolic ejection click over the left sternal border and back are all suggestive of coarctation of the aorta. Takayasu arteritis involves inflammation of large arteries and would present with other symptoms such as headache, dizziness, and visual changes. Interrupted aortic arch would present with severe cyanosis and a harsh systolic ejection murmur. Pheochromocytoma is a tumor that produces excessive amounts of catecholamines and would be less likely to present with high blood pressure in only one extremity."

The combination of high blood pressure in one arm, weak pulses in the legs, and a systolic murmur with a systolic ejection click over the left sternal border and back is most indicative of coarctation of the aorta. Takayasu arteritis is a rare disease that can cause narrowing and inflammation of large blood vessels, while Interrupted aortic arch is associated with cyanosis and heart failure. Pheochromocytoma can cause hypertension, but it would not explain the other findings in this case."

The elevated blood pressure in the right upper extremity with 2+ radial pulses and trace femoral pulses is suggestive of coarctation of the aorta. The 2/6 long systolic murmur with systolic ejection click heard over the left sternal border and back also supports this diagnosis. Takayasu arteritis can cause blood pressure abnormalities, but typically affects the aorta and its branches bilaterally. Interrupted aortic arch usually presents with severe hypotension and shock in the neonatal period. Pheochromocytoma usually presents with hypertension, but not with the characteristic finding of coarctation of the aorta."
