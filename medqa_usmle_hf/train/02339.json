Infertility may also be a comorbid condition, but it is not necessarily the main focus of initial testing and treatment. Combined oral contraceptives may be used for menstrual regulation, but they do not address the underlying hormonal imbalances and weight loss is still recommended."

Option (B) suggests weight loss as the initial treatment but lists infertility and insulin resistance as comorbid conditions, which are the same as option (A).

Other comorbid conditions to test for include insulin resistance and lipid dysfunction. Infertility is also a common problem in women with PCOS, but it is not an immediate concern in this case as the patient is not trying to conceive at this time. Combined oral contraceptives may be used to regulate periods and reduce excessive hair growth, but weight loss and lifestyle changes are the primary treatment recommended by guidelines."
