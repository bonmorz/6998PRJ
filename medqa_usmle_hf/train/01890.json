The patient shows signs of unstable and impulsive behavior, rapidly changing moods, fear of abandonment, and self-harm, which are all common in borderline personality disorder. While the patient\u2019s symptoms may overlap with bipolar disorder, her lack of changes in appetite, energy level, or concentration are not typical of bipolar I disorder. The symptoms are not consistent with factitious disorder, which involves intentionally producing physical or psychological symptoms in order to assume the role of a sick person."
