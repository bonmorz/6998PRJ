The abdominal pressure over the right upper quadrant produces persistent distention of the jugular veins, which indicates Kussmaul's sign or absent y descent. This suggests that option (A) is incorrect. Pulsus parvus et tardus occurs in Aortic stenosis, which is not suggested by the symptoms. Fixed split second heart sound occurs in Atrial septal defect, which is not suggested by the symptoms. Pericardial knock is a key feature of constrictive pericarditis and hence is the correct answer."
