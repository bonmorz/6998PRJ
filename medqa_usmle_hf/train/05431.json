The patient is likely experiencing stress urinary incontinence due to pelvic muscle weakness or injury, which resulted from her complicated delivery. Anatomic elevation of the urethra can improve the urinary sphincter function and reduce incontinence. Oral estrogen therapy is used for treating vaginal atrophy, which can contribute to urinary incontinence but is not the best course of treatment in this case. Inhibition of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase is associated with antibiotics and is not relevant to treating urinary incontinence. Dilation of a urethral or ureteral stricture would be the treatment for urethral or ureteral obstruction, which is not the cause of incontinence in this case."
