The combination of bed wetting, tilting head, and dilated pupils suggests a problem with the dorsal midbrain, specifically the pineal gland. The optic disc swelling indicates increased intracranial pressure, which further supports this diagnosis. A tumor in the cerebral falx or sella turcica would have different symptoms, such as visual field deficits or hormonal imbalances, respectively. A tumor in the cerebellar vermis may cause gait disturbances and motor deficits, but would not explain the other symptoms presented in this case."
