The patient presents with sudden-onset abdominal pain, bloody loose bowel movements, and a bruit heard over the epigastric area, which suggests mesenteric ischemia. Mesenteric angiography is the definitive test to assess the condition as it can help visualize the mesenteric arteries and identify areas of occlusion or stenosis. CT scanning and plain abdominal X-rays can help diagnose mesenteric ischemia but are not definitive. Colonoscopy is not a diagnostic test for mesenteric ischemia."
