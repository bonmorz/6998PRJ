The patient is showing symptoms of depression, including difficulty sleeping, fatigue, decreased appetite, weight loss, and loss of interest in activities. She is also expressing feelings of guilt and worry about being a burden on her family. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in management is to assess for suicidal ideation, as depression is a significant risk factor for suicide in the elderly. Options A and B are not appropriate as there is currently no evidence of abuse or neglect and the patient is not in need of skilled nursing care. Option C may be considered as part of long-term management, but addressing suicidal ideation is the more pressing concern at this time."

The patient shows symptoms of depression, including difficulty sleeping, fatigue, decreased appetite, weight loss, and loss of interest in activities. The guilt and worry about imposing on her son suggest social isolation, which is common in elderly with depression.

Option (A) and (B) are not appropriate as there is no evidence of neglect or abuse, and relocating to a nursing home is not necessary at this time. Option (C) may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate initial step as the patient needs to be evaluated for suicidal ideation first."
