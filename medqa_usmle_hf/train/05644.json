The patient\u2019s confidentiality can still be ensured by involving the parents in her care plan but keeping the specific details of her conversations with her healthcare provider private. An Anti-depressant medication can be prescribed after evaluation and therapy, but hospitalization is a priority. Anti-psychotic medication is not indicated in this case."

Prescribing medication alone is not enough to address the acute risk of suicide. Telling the parents without the patient's consent may breach confidentiality and discourage the patient from disclosing important information in the future. Prescribing an antipsychotic medication is not indicated in this case, since psychosis is not mentioned in the scenario."
