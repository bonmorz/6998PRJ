The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends annual measurement of blood pressure for all patients with diabetes, and more frequently if the patient has hypertension or other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the physician has to measure the patient\u2019s blood pressure because it is a standard of care for any person with diabetes mellitus who presents for a check-up. Option A is incorrect as relying solely on the patient's own blood pressure measurements may not be accurate, and it is important for the physician to take their own measurements in order to confirm or refute the patient's reported values. Option C is incorrect as local standards of care should still align with national guidelines, and blood pressure measurements are an important aspect of managing diabetes and preventing associated complications. Option D is incorrect as blood pressure monitoring should be continued at all follow-up appointments in order to track any changes or trends."

A patient with type 2 diabetes is at an increased risk for hypertension and hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, and stroke.

It\u2019s important to note that a patient's self-measured blood pressure may not always be accurate, and the physician may need to measure it to confirm the readings. Option (C) is incorrect as local standards of care should not differ from national standards of care in measuring blood pressure for patients with diabetes mellitus. Option (D) is incorrect as regularly measuring blood pressure is important for ongoing management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
