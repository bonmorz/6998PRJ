The patient has had recurrent syncopal episodes and the fact that it happened when the necktie was adjusted suggests carotid sinus hypersensitivity. Structural cardiac abnormalities would have been detected with cardiac examination, and panic attack would not explain the syncopal episodes. Orthostatic syncope is a possibility given the blood pressure difference in supine and standing positions, but it is less likely given the history of recurrent episodes."

Orthostatic hypotension would result in a drop in blood pressure upon standing, which is not the case here. Panic attack would not cause sudden loss of consciousness."

The fact that the patient faints when his necktie is adjusted supports the diagnosis of carotid sinus hypersensitivity, which is characterized by syncope triggered by carotid massage or pressure on the neck. The infrequent premature ventricular contractions and QRS voltage below 5 mm in leads II and III are nonspecific and do not indicate a structural heart abnormality. The patient's anxiety and medication use suggest that panic attacks could be a possibility, but the fact that the episodes are triggered by a specific maneuver points more towards carotid sinus hypersensitivity."
