The Trousseau sign and Chvostek sign are also characteristic signs of hypocalcemia. Reduction of afterhyperpolarization is the electrophysiologic mechanism that can best explain these clinical features. Afterhyperpolarization is the temporary hyperpolarization of the neuron membrane that follows an action potential. The reduction of afterhyperpolarization can lead to repetitive firing of neurons, resulting in muscle cramps and other symptoms."

The presence of muscle cramps and tingling around the mouth along with Trousseau sign and Chvostek sign suggests hypocalcemia. The most likely electrophysiologic mechanism causing these symptoms is a reduction of afterhyperpolarization, resulting in increased excitability and decreased threshold for action potentials. Option B is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because stimulation of GABA receptors would lead to decreased excitability. Option C is incorrect because inhibition of Na+ and Ca2+ currents would not cause muscle cramps and tingling. Option D is incorrect because inhibiting sodium current through sodium leak channels is not known to cause hypocalcemia or the associated symptoms."

The patient's symptoms and signs suggest hypocalcemia, which is confirmed by the low Ca2+ level in the laboratory test. The Trousseau sign and Chvostek sign are classic signs of hypocalcemia. Reduction of afterhyperpolarization is the electrophysiologic mechanism that best explains these clinical features. Afterhyperpolarization is the brief period of hyperpolarization that follows an action potential, during which the membrane potential temporarily goes below the resting potential. Reduced afterhyperpolarization can lead to increased excitability of muscle and nerve cells, which can cause muscle cramps and increased reflexes, as seen in this patient."

The patient's clinical features, including muscle cramps, tingling sensation around the mouth, and the presence of Trousseau and Chvostek signs, suggest hypocalcemia. Option B, reduction of afterhyperpolarization, best explains this condition as a reduced afterhyperpolarization increases the probability of generating an action potential, leading to spontaneous activity and neuromuscular irritability, which results in muscle cramps. Stimulation of GABA receptors, inhibition of Na+ and Ca2+ currents through CNG channels, and inhibition of sodium current through NALCN are not directly related to hypocalcemia."

The symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with hypocalcemia, which can cause muscle cramps, tingling sensations, and positive Trousseau and Chvostek signs. The low Ca2+ level in the comprehensive blood test confirms this. Reduction of afterhyperpolarization is the electrophysiologic mechanism that best explains hypocalcemia. It refers to the reduced ability of cells to repolarize after an electrical impulse, which can lead to increased excitability of cells and ultimately, the symptoms seen in this patient. None of the other options are directly related to hypocalcemia."

Among the options, reduction of afterhyperpolarization is the electrophysiologic mechanism that best explains the clinical features of hypocalcemia. Afterhyperpolarization is the brief period of hyperpolarization that occurs after an action potential, which is caused by the opening of potassium channels. Hypocalcemia impairs the function of voltage-gated calcium channels, which are essential for triggering neurotransmitter release, and thus reduces the afterhyperpolarization period. This results in increased excitability of neurons and muscles, leading to symptoms such as muscle cramps and hyperreflexia."
