The patient is presenting with hemoptysis, which can be a sign of a life-threatening condition such as a pulmonary embolism or malignancy. The first step is to secure the airway and maintain adequate oxygen saturation to prevent further deterioration. Once stabilized, further diagnostic tests such as a chest CT to determine the site of bleeding or a fiberoptic bronchoscopy to visualize the airways and assess for abnormalities can be performed. Bronchial artery embolization may be a treatment option for hemoptysis, but it is not the first step in management."

The patient is experiencing significant hemoptysis and has crackles in the right lung base, indicating a potentially life-threatening situation.

Option A may be considered if the bleeding is identified as coming from a bronchial artery, but bronchoscopy (option B) may be a more accurate diagnostic tool to identify the source of bleeding. Option D may be useful for further delineation of the pulmonary nodule but does not address the immediate issue of hemoptysis."

The patient presents with progressively worsening hemoptysis, crackles on auscultation, unintentional weight loss, and a chest x-ray showing a nodule in the right lower lobe.
