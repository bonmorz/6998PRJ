The patient has COPD and presents with an exacerbation along with a productive cough, green sputum, crackles on chest auscultation, and hyperinflation on chest X-ray. The ECG shows atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The first step in management should be to reverse bronchoconstriction and correct any electrolyte abnormalities that may be contributing to the arrhythmia. Option B, synchronized cardioversion, may be necessary if the patient becomes unstable, but not as an initial treatment. Catheter ablation of the CTI is not indicated in this case as the patient has atrial fibrillation, not atrial flutter. Metoprolol may lower heart rate, but the patient is already hypoxic and lowering the rate may worsen hypoxia."

Given the patient\u2019s history of COPD and hyperinflation of the lungs bilaterally on chest x-ray, synchronized cardioversion may be risky and exacerbate the patient\u2019s underlying disease. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker and may not be the best choice for a patient with COPD. Therefore, the initial treatment should focus on reversing bronchoconstriction with nebulized bronchodilators like albuterol and correcting any electrolyte abnormalities. This may improve the patient's respiratory status and help manage the arrhythmia."
