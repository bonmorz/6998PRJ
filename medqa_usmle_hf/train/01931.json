The timing of the lesion onset after immunization suggests that it may be a vaccine-associated sarcoma, which is a rare but reported event after vaccination. Immune complex deposition is the most likely cause in this scenario. Dermal mast cell activation and intradermal acantholysis can cause urticaria and blistering, respectively, but are less likely in this case. Infective dermal inflammation is also possible, but not as likely given the timing and presentation."

The lesion is likely a vaccine-induced injection site reaction, specifically a Type III hypersensitivity reaction characterized by immune complex deposition causing inflammation and induration. This is a common reaction to many vaccines, especially those containing adjuvants. Dermal mast cell activation (A) may occur in some allergic reactions, but it does not match the presentation in this case. Intradermal acantholysis (C) is a feature of pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune disease, and is not associated with vaccination. Infective dermal inflammation (D) may be a possible cause of a lesion, but in the absence of obvious signs of infection (such as fever, warmth, redness or pus), vaccination is a more likely etiology."
