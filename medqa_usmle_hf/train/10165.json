Surgical removal or resection would be indicated for malignancy or more severe cases, but not for an AVM."

Blood in the stool can be caused by a variety of conditions, including colon cancer, ulcerative colitis, hemorrhoids, and arteriovenous malformation. Given the patient\u2019s recent camping trip and consumption of meats and water from local sources, it is possible that he acquired an infection that led to ulcers and, subsequently, bleeding in the intestinal tract. However, given the patient\u2019s history of colon cancer, it is also possible that the bleeding is caused by a malignancy. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic that would be appropriate for treating infection, but it is not clear that the patient has an infection. Surgical removal of malignant tissue or surgical resection of a portion of the colon may be appropriate depending on the underlying cause of the bleeding, but more information is needed to make this determination. Therefore, cautery of an arteriovenous malformation is the most appropriate treatment at this time, as it is a common cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in elderly patients and can be diagnosed and treated via colonoscopy and endoscopic therapy."
