The symptoms of headache, metallic taste, abdominal pain, nausea, confusion, and bright red skin suggest cyanide poisoning. The bitter almond smell of breath is a characteristic feature. Treatment includes hyperbaric oxygen therapy and appropriate pharmacotherapy to form methemoglobin, which binds to cyanide and forms a less toxic compound. Other options are not related to the mechanism of action of the drug in treating cyanide poisoning."

Sodium thiosulfate is a commonly used antidote for cyanide poisoning, which acts by forming a harmless complex with cyanide that is excreted in the urine. In this case, the expected beneficial effect of sodium thiosulfate is due to its ability to convert cyanide to thiocyanate, which is less toxic and can be eliminated more easily by the body. This is achieved by the reaction of thiosulfate with cyanide, which forms thiocyanate and sulfite. It is important to note that sodium thiosulfate does not directly interact with hemoglobin or other blood components, and therefore options A, C, and D are not correct."

The bitter almond odor on the breath is a key diagnostic feature. The drug mentioned in the question stem is likely sodium nitrite, which facilitates the formation of methemoglobin, a form of hemoglobin that has a high binding affinity for cyanide. This effectively removes cyanide from circulation by converting it to thiocyanate, which is less toxic and can be eliminated in urine."

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) formation of methemoglobin."

The fact that the patient's breath smells of bitter almonds is a classic sign of cyanide exposure, which can occur alongside carbon monoxide poisoning. The treatment involves hyperbaric oxygen therapy and appropriate pharmacotherapy. The pharmacotherapy most likely involves a drug that forms methemoglobin, like methylene blue, which helps to convert carboxyhemoglobin to oxyhemoglobin, thereby increasing oxygen delivery to tissues. Option (C) is also true but not the expected beneficial effect of the drug in this case."
