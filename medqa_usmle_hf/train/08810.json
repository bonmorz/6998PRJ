The symptoms, including poor feeding, hoarse cry, lethargy, and an enlarged tongue, suggest hypothyroidism which is consistent with thyroid dysgenesis.

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is associated with overgrowth and omphalocele or umbilical hernia, but would not cause hypothyroidism. Congenital toxoplasmosis would present with a range of symptoms but would not likely cause the specific symptoms seen in this patient."
