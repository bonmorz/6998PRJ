The onion skin appearance of the femur on X-ray, along with the lung nodules on PET scan, suggests osteosarcoma. t(11;22) translocation is a genetic abnormality commonly found in Ewing sarcoma, which is a possible differential diagnosis. Therefore, answer (C) is the correct choice. Nonsense mutation to DMD gene is associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, defective mitochondrial DNA is seen in mitochondrial disorders, and Rb loss of function mutation is associated with retinoblastoma."
