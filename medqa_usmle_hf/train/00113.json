The presentation of the patient with pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and pericardial effusion, along with radiographic findings of pericardial calcification, suggests dystrophic calcification. This occurs when calcium accumulates in previously damaged tissues, such as in the case of chronic inflammation from tuberculosis. Metastatic calcification occurs in healthy tissue as a result of increased serum calcium levels, while amyloidosis refers to the deposition of abnormal protein in tissues, either as a result of aging or secondary to another condition."

The presented case describes tuberculosis pericarditis, which is commonly associated with dystrophic calcification within the pericardial sac. Metastatic calcifications occur when calcium is deposited in normal tissue due to altered systemic calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Secondary amyloidosis occurs when amyloid fibrils are deposited due to chronic inflammation or infection, while age-related amyloidosis is a type of primary amyloidosis that occurs in older adults. None of these mechanisms are consistent with the patient's presentation."
