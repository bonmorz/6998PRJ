The tendons pass through the radial styloid process and into the snuffbox, where they are superficial and easily palpable. Ulnar deviation of the hand with the thumb clenched in the palm produces pain, which is consistent with De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Therefore, extensor pollicis brevis is the muscle most likely affected in this patient."
