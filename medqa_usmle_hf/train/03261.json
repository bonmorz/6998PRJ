Vancomycin should only be added if there is suspicion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or if local resistance patterns warrant its use."

Option D includes vancomycin, which is only needed if there is a suspicion of resistant Gram-positive organisms, which is not indicated in this case."
