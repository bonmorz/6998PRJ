Methotrexate increases the production of deoxyuridine monophosphate, which leads to an eventual decrease in folate-dependent purine and thymidylate synthesis, ultimately leading to the death of the rapidly dividing cells in the ectopic pregnancy. Therefore, the most likely effect of methotrexate is an increase in deoxyuridine monophosphate."
