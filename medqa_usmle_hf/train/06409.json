Osteomyelitis would present with a more systemic illness and Developmental dysplasia of the hip would have been identified at a younger age."

Laboratory studies are normal except for hypothyroidism. This suggests a possible slipped capital femoral epiphysis, as it commonly presents with hip, thigh, or knee pain, and an antalgic or limping gait. Septic arthritis and osteomyelitis usually present with fever, leukocytosis, and significant pain on movement of the joint. Developmental dysplasia of the hip is more common in females and presents with hip instability and limited abduction."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a slipped capital femoral epiphysis, which commonly occurs in overweight adolescents and presents with groin or hip pain and a limp. The external rotation of the left leg and limited internal rotation also point towards this diagnosis.

The patient's symptoms, including left groin pain radiating to the left knee and a left-sided, antalgic gait, suggest slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). This condition is most common in overweight adolescent males and can occur after a minor trauma or during growth spurts. The external rotation and limited internal rotation of the left hip also support a diagnosis of SCFE. Septic arthritis would typically present with a fever and a more acute onset of symptoms, while osteomyelitis and developmental dysplasia would present with different physical exam findings."

The patient's presentation with left groin pain that radiates to the left knee and external rotation of the left lower extremity suggests a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), which is more common in boys and in those with hypothyroidism according to the article. Septic arthritis would have a higher fever and the platelet count would be decreased. Osteomyelitis would present with localized pain and tenderness over a specific bone, not the hip joint. Developmental dysplasia of the hip is typically diagnosed early in infancy and would not present with a sudden onset of symptoms."
