The EKG reveals sinus rhythm with evidence of digitalis toxicity, including a prolonged PR interval, scooping of the ST segment, and a positive T wave. The displaced point of maximal impulse, bilaterally rales, S3 gallop, and hepatomegaly all suggest heart failure, for which digoxin is a common treatment. However, excessive digoxin can lead to toxicity and cause ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, leading to sudden cardiac arrest as experienced by this patient."

The displaced PMI, rales, S3 gallop, and hepatomegaly are all signs of heart failure, which digoxin is commonly prescribed for. However, digoxin toxicity can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, which likely led to the patient's sudden cardiac arrest and death. Verapamil and amiodarone can also be used to treat cardiac arrhythmias, but they are less likely to cause these symptoms and complications. Lidocaine is primarily used for ventricular arrhythmias, but it was not mentioned as a medication that the patient was taking."
