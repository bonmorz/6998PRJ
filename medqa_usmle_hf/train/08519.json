The most common CFTR mutation, F508del, leads to defective post-translational glycosylation of the CFTR channel, resulting in a misfolded protein that is rapidly degraded. This leads to a loss of function of the CFTR channel, which is important for ion transport in various tissues, including the lungs and digestive system. Insufficient production, hydroxylation or phosphorylation are not the main pathogenic processes in cystic fibrosis."

The most common CFTR mutation, Delta F508, results in defective post-translational glycosylation of the CFTR channel, which leads to misfolding and degradation of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. This results in decreased production of functional CFTR channels on the cell surface, leading to the characteristic symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Insufficient production is not the main issue, as there are functional CFTR channels that are not properly trafficked to the cell surface. Hydroxylation and phosphorylation are not involved in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis."

The most common mutation in CFTR gene is the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del) which leads to defective post-translational glycosylation of the CFTR channel, causing abnormalities in channel folding and trafficking. This results in insufficient chloride transport across epithelial cells, leading to the characteristic symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Therefore, option (B) is correct. Option (A) is incorrect because in cystic fibrosis, there is actually an overproduction of the defective CFTR channel. Options (C) and (D) are also incorrect as they do not play a role in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis."
