As a result of hypoglycemia, she received IV dextrose without improvement, ultimately requiring mechanical ventilation. The AST and ALT are high and the INR is >3, which suggest hepatic failure. The most likely cause of her hepatic failure is glutathione saturation due to acetaminophen toxicity. The child took multiple doses of acetaminophen for her subjective fever, which led to overdose and subsequent hepatic failure. Hemosiderin deposition is not a likely cause, nor is Ca2+ efflux, which is associated with excitatory neurotoxicity. A decreased hypothalamic set point is seen in fever, but it is not the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s symptoms."

The combination of a seizure, high fever, low blood glucose, and subsequent hepatic dysfunction suggests Reye syndrome. Reye syndrome is characterized by the saturation of the body\u2019s glutathione system, leading to oxidative damage to organs, particularly the liver and brain, which can cause encephalopathy and liver failure. Hemosiderin deposition and calcium efflux are not associated with Reye syndrome. Decrease in hypothalamic set point would not cause the elevated liver enzymes seen in this case."
