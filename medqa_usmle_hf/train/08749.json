The elevated WBC count, ESR and C-reactive protein further support the diagnosis. Ultrasound of the gallbladder is the most appropriate next step in management to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications such as cholangitis or perforation. Ultrasound of the appendix is not indicated as there is no sign of appendicitis. Upper GI endoscopy may be useful in ruling out other causes of abdominal pain, but is not the most appropriate next step. Serum lipase levels are elevated in pancreatitis, which is not the most likely diagnosis in this case."
