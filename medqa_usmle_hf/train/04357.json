The elevated serum calcium and decreased calcitriol support a diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism. Bisphosphonates can be effective in lowering serum calcium levels in hyperparathyroidism. Hemodialysis is not indicated as the patient's renal insufficiency is not severe enough to warrant it, and reduced calcium intake may not be enough to lower the calcium levels quickly. Glucocorticoids are not effective in treating hyperparathyroidism."

The patient presents with symptoms of hypercalcemia, which suggests an underlying cause such as hyperparathyroidism or malignancy.

The management of hypercalcemia due to immobilization includes hydration, correction of any electrolyte imbalances, and bisphosphonates to decrease bone resorption. Option (C) is the most appropriate next step in management."
