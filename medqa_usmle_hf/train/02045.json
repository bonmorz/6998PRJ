Subarachnoid hemorrhage and bacterial meningitis would present differently on physical exam and lumbar puncture. Viral meningitis would not cause cerebral edema."

The severe headache on one side of the head can be a symptom of this condition. Option A and B are less likely since there are no signs of infection, and option C can cause a sudden, severe headache but it is usually accompanied by other neurological symptoms."

The recent outbreak of measles and the mother's attempt to prevent the daughter from getting sick with medicine suggests that the patient may have been taking too many vitamins, leading to fat-soluble vitamin overuse and resulting intracranial hypertension. Choice A and B can be ruled out because the lumbar puncture showed normal glucose levels, ruling out bacterial and viral meningitis. Choice C is also unlikely because there is no history of trauma and papilledema is not a typical finding in subarachnoid hemorrhage."

The patient\u2019s recent exposure to measles suggests that the most likely cause of her symptoms is encephalitis caused by the measles virus. However, none of the answer choices match that diagnosis. The MRI findings of cerebral edema are consistent with Fat-soluble vitamin overuse, specifically vitamin A, which can cause increased intracranial pressure and papilledema. The normal glucose level and lack of fever make bacterial meningitis unlikely. Subarachnoid hemorrhage would present with sudden onset of severe headache and neurological symptoms, which are not present in this case. Viral meningitis is a possibility but not the most likely diagnosis based on the given information."
