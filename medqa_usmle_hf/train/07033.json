Among the options, only Togaviruses have a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome, which is not disrupted by DNase treatment. The loss of infectivity after treatment with a nonionic detergent suggests that the virus has a lipid envelope, which is a characteristic of Togaviruses. Herpesviruses and Adenoviruses have a double-stranded DNA genome, which would be destroyed by DNase treatment. Caliciviruses have a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome like Togaviruses, but they do not have a lipid envelope."

The fact that the virus lost infectivity when subjected to a nonionic detergent suggests that its genome is enveloped in a lipid membrane, which is a characteristic of Togaviruses. The ability of the genome to be replicated and produce viral particles after treatment with DNase further supports this diagnosis. Herpesviruses and Adenoviruses have DNA genomes that are not enveloped and therefore would not lose infectivity when subjected to a nonionic detergent. Caliciviruses have RNA genomes and are also not enveloped, making them an unlikely option."
