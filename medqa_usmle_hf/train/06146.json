The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), a type of porphyria that affects the skin on sun-exposed areas. The medication naproxen can exacerbate symptoms of PCT.

Removing gluten from the diet has no connection to PCT, performing a stool guaiac test is used to check for blood in stool which is not related to PCT, and checking the patient\u2019s antinuclear antibody levels and renal panel is not initially relevant to the diagnosis of PCT."
