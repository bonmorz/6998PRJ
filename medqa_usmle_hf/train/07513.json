Assisting a patient in suicide could be seen as causing harm, both physically and emotionally, and goes against the physician's duty to protect the patient from harm. Autonomy, or respect for the patient's choices, may also be relevant, but it is outweighed by the duty of non-maleficence in this case. Distributive justice and formal justice are not directly relevant in this situation."

Refusing to assist a patient with suicide is most consistent with the ethical principle of non-maleficence, which means avoiding harm to the patient. While autonomy allows patients to make decisions about their own lives, assisting with suicide could cause harm and is therefore inconsistent with the principle of non-maleficence.

The principle of non-maleficence is to do no harm, and in this case, the physician is refusing to participate in a potentially harmful act. Autonomy is the right to make decisions for oneself, but assisted suicide is not considered an autonomous decision in most medical ethics frameworks. Distributive justice is concerned with fair and equitable distribution of resources, while formal justice is concerned with following established rules and laws. Neither of these principles are directly applicable in this situation."
