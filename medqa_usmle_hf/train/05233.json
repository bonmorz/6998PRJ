As the patient has an indwelling urinary catheter in place, the next step should be to evaluate the urinary catheter for obstruction as this could be contributing to the minimal urine output. Obtaining a urinalysis may also be helpful, but first addressing the potential obstruction should take priority. Administering an IV fluid bolus may not be effective if there is an obstructive cause for the decreased urine output. Initiating emergent hemodialysis may be necessary if the obstruction cannot be resolved and the patient develops further symptoms of renal failure."

Urinary catheter obstruction can be a common cause of postoperative AKI, so it is important to evaluate the catheter for any blockage or kinks. Obtaining a urinalysis may be helpful to rule out any urinary tract infection, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Administering an IV fluid bolus may be considered if the patient is hypovolemic, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this particular scenario. Initiation of emergent hemodialysis is not indicated at this time, as the patient's AKI is likely due to obstruction from the urinary catheter rather than a renal failure requiring emergent dialysis."
