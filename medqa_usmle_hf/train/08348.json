Oxacillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that works by inhibiting cell wall synthesis by targeting penicillin-binding proteins. Gram-positive, coagulase-positive cocci are likely Staphylococcus species, and resistance to oxacillin is commonly caused by altered target of the antibiotic due to production of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a), which has lower affinity to beta-lactam antibiotics. Options A and D refer to degradation and activation of the antibiotic, which are not mechanisms of resistance to oxacillin. Option B refers to decreased uptake, which is not a common mechanism for gram-positive bacteria."

The fact that the organism is resistant to oxacillin suggests that it is Staphylococcus aureus, which is known to develop resistance via altered target of the antibiotic. A) Degradation of the antibiotic is usually associated with beta-lactamase inhibitors, which are sometimes used in addition to antibiotics like oxacillin. B) Decreased uptake of the antibiotic is not applicable as the antibiotic was already able to reach and culture the organism. D) Decreased activation of the antibiotic is also not applicable as oxacillin is already an active antibiotic."
