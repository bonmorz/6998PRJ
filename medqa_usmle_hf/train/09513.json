This can lead to liver failure and mortality. Hemorrhage and cerebral vein thrombosis are possible complications of acute intermittent porphyria, but Budd-Chiari syndrome is the most likely cause of mortality in this case.

The presence of scleral icterus and elevated bilirubin also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the history of alcohol use and the presence of right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness suggest possible liver involvement. Among the options, Budd-Chiari syndrome, which is a form of liver disease characterized by obstruction of the hepatic vein, is the most likely cause of mortality. This obstruction can lead to liver failure and death if not promptly treated. Hemorrhage and high-output cardiac failure can also be complications of hemolytic anemia, but they are less likely to be the immediate cause of mortality in this case. Cerebral vein thrombosis is a rare complication of hemolytic anemia and is less likely to cause mortality than Budd-Chiari syndrome."
