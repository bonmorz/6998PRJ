Increased total lung capacity (TLC) is common in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and can also result from chronic interstitial lung disease, which can be caused by occupational exposure in the patient's profession as a farmer. Normal FEV1 and increased FEF25-75 are not likely to be present in restrictive lung disease. Decreased functional residual capacity (FRC) is typically seen in obstructive lung disease."

The flow-volume loop shows a decreased maximal expiratory flow rate during middle and expiration which is suggestive of obstructive lung disease. As a result, there could be an increased total lung capacity (TLC) due to hyperinflation of the lungs. Normal FEV1 is unlikely due to the presence of obstructive lung disease. While increased FEF25-75 can occur in asthma or respiratory bronchiolitis, the patient's history and smoking suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is typically associated with decreased FEF25-75.

Therefore, the most likely finding on the report of the pulmonary function test is increased TLC.

The flow-volume loop shows a decreased peak expiratory flow rate and a flattened expiratory limb, which are consistent with obstructive lung disease. In obstructive lung disease, TLC is often increased due to air trapping, while FRC is increased as a result of residual volume retention. Therefore, option (C) Increased total lung capacity (TLC) is the correct answer. Normal FEV1 is not expected in obstructive lung disease and increased FEF25-75 is seen in early stages of obstructive lung disease, which is not consistent with the patient's 3-year history, multiple hospitalizations, and nonspecific chest radiographs. Decreased FRC is seen in restrictive lung disease."
