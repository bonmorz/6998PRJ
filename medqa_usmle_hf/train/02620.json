The patient\u2019s symptoms, including oligomenorrhea, increased hair growth, and clitoral enlargement, suggest androgen excess. A right adnexal mass along with increased serum testosterone concentration points towards the diagnosis of a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor. Ovarian thecoma can cause androgen excess, but the absence of an adnexal mass makes it less likely. Dermoid cyst and ovarian dysgerminoma do not cause androgen excess."

The presence of clitoral enlargement and an ovarian mass make a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor the most likely diagnosis, as it is a sex cord-stromal tumor that secretes androgens. Ovarian thecoma and dermoid cysts can also cause elevated androgen levels, but they do not typically present with clitoral enlargement. Ovarian dysgerminoma does not secrete androgens, and it is more common in young women without hormonal symptoms."
