The CT scan shows multiple ring-enhancing lesions with surrounding edema, which are indicative of cerebral toxoplasmosis. Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin are the appropriate medications to treat this condition. The patient\u2019s leukocyte count is low, which indicates immunosuppression, and his CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is very low, which supports the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The track marks on both arms and the admission of heroin use indicate possible intravenous drug use, which can increase the risk of HIV infection."

The CT scan findings show ring-enhancing lesions, which are suggestive of toxoplasma encephalitis, a common infection in immunocompromised individuals. The most appropriate next step is to begin antitoxoplasma therapy, which consists of pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin. CT-guided stereotactic aspiration is not indicated as it may lead to further neurological damage. Albendazole is used for cysticercosis and echinococcosis, which are not suggested by the CT scan findings. Glucocorticoids are used to reduce inflammation, but their use is controversial in toxoplasma encephalitis as they may worsen the infection."

Option C, albendazole, would be indicated for neurocysticercosis, which has a different appearance on imaging. Option D, glucocorticoids, may be used to reduce inflammation in some cases of encephalitis, but it is not a first-line treatment for toxoplasmosis."
