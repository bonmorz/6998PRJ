TSS is caused by a polyclonal T cell activation in response to bacterial toxins, specifically Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Option A is incorrect because erythrogenic toxin is associated with Strep pyogenes but not TSS. Option B is incorrect because lipooligosaccharide expression is associated with Neisseria meningitidis but not TSS. Option C is incorrect because unregulated B cell proliferation is associated with Burkitt lymphoma but not TSS."
