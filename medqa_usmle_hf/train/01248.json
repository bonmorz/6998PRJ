The fact that his symptoms improve after 2 minutes of being in a certain position is characteristic of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Labyrinthitis would likely have a longer duration of symptoms and possibly hearing loss. Vertebrobasilar stroke would present with more severe and persistent neurologic deficits. Vestibular neuritis may have similar symptoms but would not present with the positional component seen in BPPV."

The characteristic features of the symptoms, including sudden-onset spining sensation, nausea and vomiting, and exacerbation of symptoms with certain head positions, suggest Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). The normal gait and unremarkable cranial nerve exam supports this diagnosis. Labyrinthitis and Vestibular neuritis usually present with continuous vertigo and hearing loss. Vertebrobasilar stroke usually presents with other neurological symptoms, such as limb weakness or gait abnormalities."

The sudden-onset sensation of the room spinning, nausea, and vomiting are typical of vertigo, but the patient's symptoms subsided on their own. The presence of nystagmus and relief of symptoms after a few minutes of being in a certain position suggest Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is caused by the displacement of calcium carbonate crystals within the inner ear. Labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis have symptoms that last for several days and vertebrobasilar stroke would have other signs and symptoms, such as vertigo with an associated headache or loss of consciousness."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, onset, and exacerbation with certain head movements suggest the most likely diagnosis is Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is a common cause of vertigo characterized by a brief sensation of spinning, typically triggered by changes in head position. Labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis typically involve more constant vertigo and are not triggered by head movements. Vertebrobasilar stroke is a more serious potential cause of vertigo but would typically present with a rapid onset of severe symptoms including other neurological deficits, which are not present in this case."

The sudden onset of spinning sensation and symptoms resolving quickly suggest that the most likely diagnosis is Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The fact that symptoms were exacerbated when the patient\u2019s head was turned to the left and then improved after 2 minutes suggest that the patient has a specific variant of BPPV which is related to the left posterior semicircular canal. Labyrinthitis will also cause vertigo but typically lasts for several days and is associated with hearing loss, which the patient does not have. Vertebrobasilar stroke will cause vertigo but will typically be associated with other neurologic symptoms. Vestibular neuritis will also cause vertigo but typically lasts for several days and will not respond to positional changes."
