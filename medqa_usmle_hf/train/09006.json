Sympathetic stimulation, which is mediated by norepinephrine and epinephrine, stimulates glycogenolysis in the liver and increases glucose production. Therefore, the correct answer is (D), as it correctly identifies that epinephrine increases liver glycogenolysis. Option (A) is incorrect as norepinephrine does not cause increased glucose absorption within the intestines. Option (B) is also incorrect as insulin acts on the liver to stimulate glycogen synthesis and inhibit gluconeogenesis, and it does not require epinephrine. Option (C) is also incorrect as sympathetic stimulation to alpha receptors of the pancreas decreases insulin release."
