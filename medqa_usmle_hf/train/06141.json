The patient has a systolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border that radiates to the axilla, which suggests hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) as an underlying cause. The murmur decreases with squatting in HOCM due to increased preload, while it increases in aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, and mitral regurgitation. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer."

Squatting increases the intensity of the murmur, suggesting hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). In HOCM, squatting increases venous return and decreases peripheral vascular resistance, which results in decreased obstruction and increased filling of the left ventricle, leading to an increased intensity of the murmur. Option (B) and (C) are incorrect because neither of them involves a systolic murmur or a change in murmur intensity with squatting. Option (D) is incorrect because squatting decreases the intensity of the murmur in aortic stenosis."

The patient's history and physical exam findings suggest hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), which is a condition that can result from untreated streptococcal pharyngitis. Squatting can increase the preload on the heart and reduce the intensity of the murmur, which supports the diagnosis of HOCM. Option B, mitral stenosis, would produce a diastolic murmur and not a systolic murmur. Option C, decreased murmur in mitral stenosis, is not a known phenomenon. Option D, increased murmur in aortic stenosis, would produce a systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border that does not radiate to the axilla."
