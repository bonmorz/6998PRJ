Among the options, Proteus mirabilis is the most likely causal organism, as it is a common cause of urinary tract infections in the elderly and is known to cause alkaline urine. Enterococcus faecalis is also a common cause of urinary tract infections, but does not typically cause alkaline urine. Staphylococcus saprophyticus is more commonly seen in young, sexually active females. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a less common cause of urinary tract infections, and typically causes an intense inflammatory response."
