Since there are 20 students in the class and 2 were already sick in the first week, there are 18 students left who could potentially get sick. In the second week, 3 more students got sick, so the total number of students who were sick in the first two weeks is 2 + 3 = 5. Therefore, the risk of contracting influenza during the second week is 3/18 = 0.17, or 17%."

Out of these 18 students, 3 more contracted the flu during the second week, so the risk would be 3/18 or 0.17. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."

However, we need to take into account that two students had already contracted the flu in the first week, so they cannot get it again in the second week. This means that the total number of susceptible students in the second week was 18. Therefore, the risk of contracting influenza during the second week was 3/18 or about 0.17, which is answer choice B."
