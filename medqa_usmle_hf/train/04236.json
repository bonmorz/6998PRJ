Placenta implantation into myometrium (placenta accreta) and malpositioned placenta overlying the cervix (placenta previa) are complications of pregnancy but are not likely in this case. Malignant transformation of trophoblastic tissue (choriocarcinoma) is a rare complication of a complete or partial molar pregnancy but this patient's presentation is not consistent with that diagnosis."
