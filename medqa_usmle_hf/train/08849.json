Estrogen, oxytocin, and thyroxine also play roles in lactation but are not primarily responsible for the observed changes in milk production at this time."

After delivery, progesterone levels rapidly decrease, allowing the woman to begin producing milk. The initial thick, yellowish milk is called colostrum and is rich in immunoglobulins, while the milk that comes later is thinner and more plentiful. Therefore, the decrease in maternal serum concentration of progesterone is most likely responsible for the observed changes in milk production."
