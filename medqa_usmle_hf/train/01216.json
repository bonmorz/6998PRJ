The patient presents with tremors, rigidity, and difficulty with movements, which are classic symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Among the options, degeneration of the substantia nigra is the most likely underlying cause of these symptoms, as it is responsible for producing dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is necessary for normal movement. Copper accumulation in the basal ganglia can cause Wilson's disease, which can also present with tremors, but this would typically be seen in a much younger patient. Increased serum free T4 levels would suggest hyperthyroidism, which can cause tremors, but other symptoms such as weight loss and heat intolerance would likely also be present. Infarction of the red nucleus can cause a type of tremor called rubral tremor, but this would typically involve the arms and legs and would not present with rigidity or difficulty with movements."

The patient has a rhythmic tremor that is more prominent in the left hand, which suggests Parkinson's disease, the most common cause of which is degeneration of the substantia nigra. Copper accumulation can lead to Wilson's disease, which can also cause tremors, but it is less likely given the absence of other symptoms. Increased serum free T4 levels can lead to hyperthyroidism, which can cause tremors, but there are no indications of hyperthyroidism in this patient. Infarction of the red nucleus can cause tremors, but it is less common compared to Parkinson's disease."
