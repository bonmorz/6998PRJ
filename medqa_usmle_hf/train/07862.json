The patient's history of asthma, GERD, and allergic rhinitis suggest an immunological disorder. The skin findings, wheezing, and peripheral neuropathy suggest a vasculitis. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously called Churg-Strauss syndrome) is a systemic vasculitis that affects small- to medium-sized vessels and is often associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis. The skin findings, including the lace-like discoloration and papular rash, are also common in this condition. The other options can present with similar symptoms but do not fit as well with the patient's medical history and physical examination findings."
