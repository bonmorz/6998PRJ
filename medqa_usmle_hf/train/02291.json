The patient is experiencing symptoms of acute rejection of the transplanted lung, which is likely caused by T cell sensitization against the donor MHC class II antigen. This can happen in the setting of immunosuppressive therapy, which can reduce but not eliminate the risk of rejection. Donor ABO or CMV antigen would not cause this type of rejection, and Streptococcal C polysaccharide antigen is not relevant to this scenario."
