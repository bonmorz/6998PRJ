The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and unstable angina, as well as an abnormal ECG with Q waves and inverted T waves, indicating previous damage to the heart muscle. Therefore, he is at increased risk for perioperative cardiac events. Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging is a non-invasive test that can help assess cardiac function and determine the patient's risk for perioperative cardiac events. Ambulatory ECG monitoring and treadmill stress test are less effective in identifying cardiac risk in this patient population. No further testing is not appropriate as the patient clearly has increased cardiac risk."
