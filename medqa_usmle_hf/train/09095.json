In this case, the patient's heart failure has gotten worse over the years, indicating a decrease in cardiac output. As cardiac output decreases, it causes a decrease in blood pressure, which then causes an increase in right atrial pressure. This is because the right side of the heart has to work harder to pump blood into the lungs due to the decreased cardiac output. Therefore, the correct answer is (B), cardiac output went down, and right atrial pressure went up."
