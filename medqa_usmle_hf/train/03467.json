The symptoms of inattentiveness, difficulty completing tasks, and social withdrawal suggest that the most likely diagnosis is Autism spectrum disorder. The preference for playing alone and fixation on a particular toy also support this diagnosis. Oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder are more associated with behavioral issues such as defiance and aggression. Rett syndrome is a genetic disorder that typically presents with regression of developmental milestones, loss of hand skills, and stereotypic hand movements, which are not seen in this patient."
