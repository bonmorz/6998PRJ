A low lecithin:sphingomyelin ratio (<1.5) is an indication of immature lungs and increased risk for respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants. This is because lecithin helps to stabilize the alveoli and reduce surface tension, while sphingomyelin does not have these properties. Therefore, a low ratio indicates a deficiency in the lung surfactant system, which can lead to respiratory distress in the neonate. The other options have high ratios, which indicate mature lungs and lower risk for pulmonary distress."

The ratio of lecithin:sphingomyelin (L/S ratio) in amniotic fluid is used to predict the likelihood of the infant having respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). A low L/S ratio (<1.5) is indicative of an increased risk of RDS, while a high L/S ratio (>2) is indicative of a decreased risk.

A ratio <1.5 indicates immaturity of the lung, which is associated with respiratory distress syndrome. The other options are incorrect because a high lecithin:sphingomyelin ratio suggests well-developed lungs, and the lecithin:phosphatidylserine ratio has been found to have a lower predictive value for respiratory distress syndrome."
