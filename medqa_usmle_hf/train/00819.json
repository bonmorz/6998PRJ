The patient has clinical features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) such as irregular menstrual cycles, facial acne, and hirsutism.

The best course of treatment for this patient would be oral contraceptives, which can help regulate menstrual cycles, reduce acne, and decrease androgen levels. Clomiphene is used for ovulation induction and would not be appropriate in this case. Goserelin is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist used for endometriosis and prostate cancer. Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor used for breast cancer and infertility, but it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for PCOS."
