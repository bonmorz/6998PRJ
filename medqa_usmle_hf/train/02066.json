The ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF suggests an inferior wall myocardial infarction. This is because these leads monitor the inferior portion of the left ventricle, which is supplied by the right coronary artery. The lateral wall is supplied by the left circumflex artery, while the posterior wall is more difficult to diagnose due to its deep position. Right ventricular myocardial infarction may occur in conjunction with an inferior wall myocardial infarction, but it is not the most probable diagnosis based on the information presented."
