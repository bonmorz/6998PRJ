The patient's symptoms of epigastric pain that occur after eating and weight loss suggest a possible gastrointestinal issue. However, physical exam and esophagogastroduodenoscopy are unremarkable, ruling out Peptic ulcer disease and Crohn's disease. Given the patient's history of hyperlipidemia and myocardial infarction, it is more likely that the epigastric pain is related to atherosclerosis in the mesenteric arteries, leading to pain and ischemia after eating. Amyloid deposition is also a possibility but less likely given the lack of other symptoms and diagnostic findings."
