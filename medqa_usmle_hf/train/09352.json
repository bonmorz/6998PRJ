There are several factors in the patient's medical history that could contribute to infertility, such as the history of miscarriages and the blood clot in her lower extremity. However, the presence of a positive VDRL test is highly suggestive of syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection that can lead to infertility if left untreated. Elevated TSH levels can cause menstrual irregularities, but it is not directly associated with infertility. Autosomal dominant mutation in factor V and positive antihistone antibodies are not typically associated with infertility."
