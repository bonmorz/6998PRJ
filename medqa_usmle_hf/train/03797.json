The symptoms suggest diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) which happens when there is a shortage of insulin leading to an accumulation of ketones and acidosis.

The patient's symptoms and history suggest diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which occurs due to an absolute or relative deficiency of insulin. As a result, the body switches to fat metabolism for energy, leading to the production of ketones, which lowers blood pH and increases anion gap. Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a decreased pH, decreased bicarbonate, and increased anion gap. Therefore, the most likely answer is (C) - \u2193 pH, \u2193 bicarbonate and \u2191 anion gap."
