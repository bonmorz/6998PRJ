The patient history also mentions chronic constipation, which can contribute to the development of a volvulus. Acute diverticulitis would present with fever, left lower quadrant pain, and leukocytosis, but there is no presence of diverticula on the X-ray. Intussusception would present with intermittent, crampy abdominal pain that is relieved by bowel movements and a sausage-shaped mass on palpation. Colon cancer may cause similar symptoms, but the sudden onset of symptoms and characteristic X-ray finding make sigmoid volvulus the most likely diagnosis."

Acute diverticulitis typically presents with left lower quadrant pain and tenderness without distension. Intussusception presents with intermittent abdominal pain, visible peristalsis, and a palpable sausage-shaped mass.

The tenderness mainly in the left lower quadrant and tympanic abdomen on percussion are also suggestive of this condition. Acute diverticulitis and colon cancer may cause abdominal pain and elevated WBC count but are less likely to cause distension and constipation.
