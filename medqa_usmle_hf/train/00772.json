The patient has cirrhosis with recurrent esophageal varices and just underwent TIPS placement, so it is likely that she is experiencing hepatic encephalopathy. The low potassium level is likely due to the use of diuretics for ascites. Lactulose is the preferred treatment for hepatic encephalopathy as it traps ammonia in the colon and promotes its excretion in the feces. Ciprofloxacin may be used for prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but it is not appropriate for hepatic encephalopathy. Nadolol is a beta-blocker that can be used to prevent variceal bleeding, but it does not treat hepatic encephalopathy. A protein-restricted diet is not the first-line treatment for hepatic encephalopathy and may lead to malnutrition."
