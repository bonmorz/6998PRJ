The patient\u2019s history suggests a possible leiomyoma (fibroid) causing increasing pelvic pressure and worsening urinary frequency.

No mention is made of multiple fetal heartbeats or amniotic fluid volume, so multiple gestation pregnancy cannot be assumed. The patient\u2019s prenatal lab results and history do not suggest any uterine anomaly."

Multiple gestation pregnancy can also present with increased pelvic pressure and fundus palpation higher than expected, but the patient\u2019s cervix is closed and there are no adnexal masses.
