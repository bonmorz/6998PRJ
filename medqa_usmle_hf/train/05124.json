Negative staining for thyroglobulin would be consistent with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, which is highly aggressive and has a poor prognosis. Reduced number of functional thyroid cells or disorganized proliferation of mature thyroid cells are more consistent with differentiated thyroid cancer, which has a better prognosis. Increased expression of thyroid transcription factor-1 is a normal finding in thyroid cells and would not be associated with anaplasia."
