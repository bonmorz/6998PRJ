The formation of cavities near the apex of lungs is a common feature of tuberculosis (TB), and is mainly mediated by TH1 cells. TH1 cells secrete inflammatory cytokines that activate macrophages to engulf and destroy the mycobacterium causing the infection, but also cause tissue damage and formation of cavities. Toxin secretion, B-cells, and NK cells are not directly involved in the formation of the cavities in TB."
