The patient is undergoing bone marrow transplantation which puts them at risk for opportunistic infections like Aspergillus fumigatus.

Mycoplasma pneumonia will have more diffuse interstitial infiltrates on chest radiograph, and Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumonia are less likely causes in this population."
