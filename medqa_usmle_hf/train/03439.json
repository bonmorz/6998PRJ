The surgery the patient underwent involves the removal of the duodenum and part of the pancreas, which may result in a fistula between the pancreatic and biliary ducts and the small bowel. This can lead to metabolic acidosis due to loss of bicarbonate and pancreatic enzymes. The electrolyte imbalance can be a result of fluid shifts or excessive nasogastric suction rather than excessive alcohol intake or medication effects. Adrenal insufficiency does not fit the symptom presentation."
