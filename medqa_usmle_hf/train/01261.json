This inhibition can lead to impaired bone healing and increased risk of fractures. Therefore, NSAIDs may have predisposed this patient to the outcome of a fracture from a fall. Option B is incorrect because inhibiting circulating cytokines is not linked with bone healing or fracture risk. Option C is incorrect because folate processing is not related to bone healing or fracture risk. Option D is incorrect as prostaglandin production inhibition is not enough to explain the increased risk of fractures."

Inhibition of circulating cytokines is not associated with increased risk of falls or fracture, and inhibition of folate processing is not a known side effect of any commonly used medications."
