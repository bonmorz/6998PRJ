The platelet count of 65,000/mm^3 further confirms this. In children, viral infections and medications are common causes of thrombocytopenia. IVIg is indicated for immune thrombocytopenia, but this has not been confirmed in this case. Rituximab and splenectomy are not appropriate for the management of viral-induced thrombocytopenia. Observation is the best management in this case as the patient is otherwise well and the platelet count is above 50,000/mm^3. The rash should be monitored and the patient should be advised to avoid trauma and contact sports until the platelet count returns to normal. Follow-up platelet counts should also be performed."
