The patient's symptoms suggest a movement disorder, and among the options, only CAG triplet expansion on chromosome 4 is associated with Huntington's disease, which can present with involuntary movements and changes in behavior. Frontotemporal lobe degeneration can also cause changes in behavior, but it does not typically present with writhing movements. GAA triplet expansion on chromosome 9 is associated with Friedreich\u2019s ataxia, which is a genetic disorder that affects muscle and movement coordination. The presence of misfolded proteins in the brain is a feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, but it is not specific enough to determine the cause of this patient's symptoms."
