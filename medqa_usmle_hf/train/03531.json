The patient's presentation is consistent with acute severe anemia and sepsis, which is commonly seen with infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient's age also increases the likelihood of S. pneumoniae as a causative organism. While Salmonella can cause sepsis and anemia, it is more commonly associated with gastroenteritis in this age group. H. influenzae and N. meningitidis are also possible causes of sepsis but are less likely in this case."
