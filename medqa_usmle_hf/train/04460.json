The patient presents with signs of early pregnancy (breast engorgement, increased pigmentation of the nipples, linea alba, cervical and vaginal cyanosis), but the urine pregnancy test is negative. This is likely due to testing too early, low hormone levels, or a faulty test. Therefore, blood human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is most appropriate to confirm the pregnancy, as it is produced by the placenta and can be detected as early as 10 days after conception. Blood estriol and blood progesterone are used to evaluate fetal well-being in later stages of pregnancy, and urinary estrogen metabolites are not specific for pregnancy."
