This can cause cyanosis and low oxygen saturation, which is consistent with the baby's symptoms of bluish discoloration and low oxygen saturation. The single second heart sound without murmurs is also suggestive of transposition of great vessels. The chest X-ray may also show a narrow mediastinum, which is a typical finding in transposition of great vessels, although this is not provided in the exhibit. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is option (B) transposition of great vessels."
