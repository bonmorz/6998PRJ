The high bilirubin, AST, and ALT levels support this diagnosis. Hemolytic uremic syndrome would have elevated creatinine and decreased platelet counts. Ecstasy intoxication and cocaine-abstinence syndrome do not explain the liver failure and jaundice."

The patient has symptoms such as yellow skin, elevated bilirubin levels, elevated liver enzymes, and low prothrombin activity that suggest acute liver failure. The drug use and high-risk sexual behavior may suggest the possibility of viral hepatitis or other infections causing liver failure. Ecstasy intoxication and cocaine-abstinence syndrome do not present with these symptoms.

The patient has signs of liver failure, including jaundice, elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes, and low protein activity.

Hemolytic uremic syndrome typically presents with hemolytic anemia and renal failure, which are not seen in this patient. Ecstasy intoxication and cocaine-abstinence syndrome can cause agitation, but they do not explain the other symptoms and laboratory findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is fulminant hepatic failure."
