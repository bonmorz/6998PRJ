The infant is presenting with signs of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which can be prevented with indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and helps close the ductus arteriosus. Betamethasone is given to mothers at risk of preterm delivery to promote fetal lung maturation. Folic acid is important for fetal neural tube development. Prostaglandins are important for maintaining the patency of the ductus arteriosus in utero, but in this case, they are causing abnormal shunting of blood and worsening the PDA."
