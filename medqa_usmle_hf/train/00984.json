The symptoms suggest nephrotic syndrome, which is associated with increased permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier resulting in proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia. The biopsy will most likely show normal glomeruli on light microscopy, as nephrotic syndrome is a functional, not a structural, disease of the glomerulus. A diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome cannot be confirmed by the findings in the biopsy alone, but rather requires the clinical presentation and laboratory results described. Option A describes membranous nephropathy, Option B describes mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, and Option C describes membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis."
