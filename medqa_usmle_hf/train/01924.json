The fact that the organism is impervious to Gram stain indicates that it has a high mycolic acid content in its cell wall, which is a defining feature of mycobacteria like the ones that cause tuberculosis. Low muramic acid content in the cell wall is seen in some bacteria but is not related to this case. Absence of cellular wall is not possible in a bacterium as it would not be able to survive without a cell wall. Teichoic acid-rich cell walls are seen in Gram-positive bacteria only."
