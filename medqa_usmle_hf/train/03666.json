He also has risk factors for DVT such as recent surgery and chronic kidney disease. Inferior vena cava filter placement is the most appropriate next step as anticoagulation with heparin or warfarin may lead to bleeding complications in a patient with recent craniotomy and hemodialysis. Urokinase therapy may be considered if the patient shows signs of worsening or extension of the thrombus despite filter placement."

The patient\u2019s symptoms and medical history suggest deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) as potential complications. However, the patient\u2019s surgical history and recent hemodialysis make him a high risk for bleeding, which makes unfractionated heparin therapy and urokinase therapy inappropriate treatment options at this time. Warfarin therapy can also increase the risk of bleeding and is not recommended immediately after surgery. The most appropriate next step is to place an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter to prevent any potential pulmonary embolism from a DVT."

Unfractionated heparin therapy and warfarin therapy are both anticoagulant therapies that can increase the risk of bleeding in patients with chronic kidney disease requiring hemodialysis. Urokinase therapy may be considered if there is a confirmed deep vein thrombosis, but IVC filter placement is typically the first step in treatment."
