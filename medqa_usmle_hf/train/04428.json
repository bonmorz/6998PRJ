However, the absence of midline spinal tenderness and negative urinalysis make this less likely. The lack of pain with hip flexion and knee extension, along with tense paraspinal muscles, suggests a muscular cause of pain, possibly due to the recent physical activity. The most appropriate next step in management would be to treat the pain with analgesia and encourage regular activity to prevent deconditioning. MRI and measurements of serum HLA-B27 are not indicated in this case. Spinal traction is also not necessary for the management of muscular back pain."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest acute nonspecific lower back pain, which is common and usually resolves on its own without specific treatment.

Analgesia and regular activity are the most appropriate next step in management. MRI of the spine is not indicated for acute low back pain unless there are red flag symptoms or signs. Serum HLA-B27 is not useful in the workup of acute low back pain. Spinal traction is not indicated for acute low back pain."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest musculoskeletal pain due to physical exertion (helping move a friend) and a history of intravenous heroin use, which may have weakened the back muscles. In addition, the negative leg raise test and normal urinalysis suggest no underlying spinal or renal pathology. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is analgesia and regular activity. MRI of the spine is unnecessary given the lack of other symptoms or abnormalities, while testing for HLA-B27 is not indicated in this case. Spinal traction is also unlikely to provide significant relief for musculoskeletal pain."
