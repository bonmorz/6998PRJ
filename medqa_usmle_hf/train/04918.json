Quadriplegia with neurogenic shock results from cervical spinal cord injury, which causes loss of muscle power and absence of sensations in the limbs. Option A is incorrect because the blood pressure is too low for a normal rectal tone on DRE. Option B is incorrect because the blood pressure is too high for neurogenic shock. Option D is incorrect because the pulse is too high for neurogenic shock. Option C is the correct answer as it presents with the right combination of findings for quadriplegia with neurogenic shock, such as the low blood pressure, loss of rectal tone, and reduced muscle power and absence of sensations in the limbs."

The hyperextension of the cervical spine caused by a trampoline injury can cause cervical spinal cord injury, leading to quadriplegia with neurogenic shock. Neurogenic shock is a type of distributive shock where there is low blood pressure, high heart rate, and low systemic vascular resistance due to loss of sympathetic tone. The loss of rectal tone on DRE and reduced muscle power and absence of sensations in the limbs indicate spinal cord injury. The answer choice that matches these findings is option (C)."

This usually causes a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate, leading to the classic findings of bradycardia, hypotension, and decreased respiratory rate (option C). Loss of rectal tone on DRE and reduced muscle power and absence of sensations in the limbs are also common findings in cases of spinal cord injury. Option A is not consistent with neurogenic shock, as the blood pressure is too low and the respiratory rate is too high for this diagnosis. Option B describes hypertensive emergency, which is unlikely in this case. Option D describes tachycardia, which is not typically seen in neurogenic shock."
