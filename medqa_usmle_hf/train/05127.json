Option (A) is incorrect because in this patient, HPV co-testing is not recommended after age 65. Option (B) is incorrect because repeated Pap smears every 3 years are not recommended in this patient according to current guidelines. Option (D) is incorrect because Pap smears every 5 years are not recommended after age 65."

According to the American Cancer Society, cervical cancer screening can be discontinued in women over the age of 65 who have had adequate prior screening and no history of high-grade precancerous lesions, unless they have a history of cervical cancer or were exposed to DES in utero. Therefore, discontinuing screening should be considered in this patient. Option A is not recommended as the patient is over 65 and has a history of normal Pap smears. Options B and D are not appropriate for this patient as they do not meet the criteria for screening according to the American Cancer Society guidelines."

As the patient in the question has been menopausal since 54 years of age, and has had negative Pap smear and HPV screening results for the past 30 years, discontinuing screening should be considered. Therefore, the correct answer is (C). Options (A) and (D) specify screening intervals that are not appropriate for this patient, and option (B) suggests repeating the Pap smear every 3 years, which is not necessary if screening is discontinued."
