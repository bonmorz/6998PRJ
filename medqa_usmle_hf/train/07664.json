The study found that high-quality afterschool programming during childhood (ages 5-10) was associated with a decreased risk of ADHD in adults (Hazard Ratio of 0.80 with a p-value of 0.02). The study did not suggest that the patient's family history prevented any conclusions from being drawn, nor did it suggest that afterschool programming would decrease the patient's risk of developing major depressive disorder specifically. Additionally, the study did not compare the effects of afterschool programming on reducing risk of psychotic disorder versus bipolar disorder. Therefore, answer choice (D) is the best statement that addresses the mother's question based on the study results provided."

The study found that high-quality afterschool programming during childhood was associated with a lower risk of developing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adulthood. Therefore, option D is correct. The study did not address the patient's family history specifically, so option A is incorrect. The study did not specifically state that afterschool programming would decrease the patient's risk of developing major depressive disorder, so option B is incorrect. The study did not compare the effects of afterschool programming on reducing the risk of psychotic disorder versus bipolar disorder, so option C is incorrect."

The study found that high-quality afterschool programming in childhood was associated with a decreased risk of ADHD in adults, as shown by a hazard ratio of 0.80 with a P-value of 0.02. The study did not find any significant effect of afterschool programming on the risk of bipolar disorder or psychotic disorder in adults, as shown by hazard ratios of 0.64 and 0.84 with P-values of 0.34 and 0.22, respectively. The family history of psychiatric illness in the patient's grandmothers is not mentioned to affect the study's conclusions, and there is no evidence to suggest that afterschool programming would specifically decrease the patient's risk of major depressive disorder. Therefore, the best option is (D), which accurately summarizes the study's finding on the association between afterschool programming and ADHD risk in adults."

The study's table shows that the hazard ratio (HR) for ADHD in adults is 0.80 (with a 95% confidence interval of 0.74-0.92) for those who received afterschool enrichment during childhood, which is statistically significant (p-value 0.02). Therefore, statement (D) is the best answer. Statement (A) is incorrect because the family history of psychiatric illness was controlled for in the study's analysis. Statement (B) and (C) are incorrect because the study did not specifically examine the effect on this patient's risk of developing major depressive disorder or bipolar/psychotic disorders."
