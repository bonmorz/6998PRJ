This gene encodes for the beta subunit of hemoglobin. Transaldolase is an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway that is required for the production of nucleotides, which are needed for red blood cell production. In sickle cell anemia, the abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to deform and break down, leading to anemia and dark urine."
