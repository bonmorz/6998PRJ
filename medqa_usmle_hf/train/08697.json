The diagnosis of a rare genetic disorder leading to low levels of N-acetylglutamate suggests a deficiency in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS1). CPS1 is the first and rate-limiting step of the urea cycle, and low levels of N-acetylglutamate result in decreased activity of CPS1, leading to hyperammonemia and subsequent neurological deterioration. The other enzymes listed are also involved in the urea cycle but are not directly impacted by levels of N-acetylglutamate."
