A clean-based ulcer is less likely to experience additional GI bleeding, as it indicates the ulcer is in the process of healing and the risk of further bleeding is low. The other options, including a visible bleeding vessel and gastric ulcer with arteriovenous malformations, indicate active bleeding and increased risk of future bleeding. An adherent clot on an ulcer may also indicate a recent bleed but does not necessarily predict future bleeding."
