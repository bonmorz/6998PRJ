The release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is a process called voltage-gated calcium release, which is similar to the transport of fructose by small intestinal enterocytes through the use of glucose transporters.

Reabsorption of glucose by renal tubular cells involves glucose transporters, secretion of doxorubicin from dysplastic colonic cells involves drug transporters, and absorption of LDL-cholesterol by hepatocytes involves LDL receptors, which are all different mechanisms compared to the process described in the question."

The release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle fibers is a process known as excitation-contraction coupling.

The other options do not involve a similar transport mechanism to the release of calcium in muscle fibers."
