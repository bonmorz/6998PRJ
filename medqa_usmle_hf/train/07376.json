The x-ray shows multiple round opacities in both lungs, which suggests the presence of trophoblastic tissue. This, along with the bloody vaginal discharge and tender uterus, indicates a diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic disease. Histopathology of the curettage specimen is most likely to show cytrotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts without chorionic villi as gestational trophoblastic disease is characterized by the proliferation of abnormal trophoblastic tissue without fetal tissue."
