Option (A) is not appropriate because the resident should explain the procedure, risks, and benefits before obtaining informed consent, not just have the patient sign a form. Option (B) is not correct because residents are legally allowed to obtain informed consent, but should only do so if they are knowledgeable about the procedure. Option (C) is incorrect because suprapubic catheterization is a valid option for patients who are unable to void and have failed transurethral catheterization. Option (D) is the most appropriate response because it acknowledges the resident\u2019s lack of experience and defer to the urologist to obtain informed consent when she becomes available."

Option (B) is incorrect because residents can obtain informed consent with appropriate supervision. Option (C) is incorrect because suprapubic catheterization is a common and effective treatment for acute urinary retention, especially when transurethral catheterization is not possible. Option (A) is incorrect because obtaining the patient\u2019s signature on the form does not necessarily mean that they fully understand the procedure and its risks."

Option (C) is not correct because there may be various reasons why suprapubic catheterization is the best option for this patient, and it is not the resident's place to question the urologist's plan. Option (D) is the most appropriate because it shows willingness to assist with the informed consent process, while acknowledging the need for the urologist to obtain it when possible. The resident can also offer to explain the procedure and answer any questions the patient may have in the meantime."
