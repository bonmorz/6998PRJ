Within the spleen, germinal centers are the areas where B cell maturation occurs, and these are critical for the development of B cells that will target Escherichia coli in the mouse model. The red pulp is primarily involved in filtering and removal of old or damaged red blood cells, while the marginal zone is important for filtering blood-borne pathogens. Sinusoids are vascular structures within the spleen that aid in blood filtration."
