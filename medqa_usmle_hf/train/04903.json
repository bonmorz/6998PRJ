The patient\u2019s history of infective endocarditis, intravenous drug use, and distension of the neck veins suggest the possibility of tricuspid valve endocarditis with tricuspid regurgitation.

Prominent y descent and large a waves are seen in conditions like constrictive pericarditis and complete heart block. Decreased c waves can be seen in conditions like tricuspid stenosis, but this is not likely in this patient with possible tricuspid regurgitation."
