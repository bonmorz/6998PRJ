Potassium ions are the major contributor to this gradient, with the intracellular concentration of potassium being much higher than the extracellular concentration. Sodium ions, however, also play a role in generating the resting membrane potential. This is because the cell membrane has leak channels that allow a small amount of sodium ions to diffuse into the cell, making the intracellular environment slightly more positive than the extracellular environment. This results in a potential difference of about -70 mV across the cell membrane. Therefore, the influx of Na+ ions is the most important contributor to the difference between the resting membrane potential and the equilibrium potential of potassium."

The resting membrane potential of a cell is generated by the selective permeability of the cell membrane to different ions, with potassium (K+) being the main contributor. The equilibrium potential for K+ is -85 mV, and since the resting membrane potential is -70 mV, there is a difference of 15 mV that maintains the cell's electrical charge. The influx of Na+ ions (equilibrium potential at +65 mV) into the cell during depolarization plays a role in the generation of the action potential, but it is not the most important contributor to the difference between the resting membrane potential and the equilibrium potential of K+. Influx of Ca2+ ions and Mg2+ ions have little to no effect on the resting membrane potential, and influx of Cl- ions (equilibrium potential at -85 mV) would tend to oppose the electrical charge generated by K+. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) influx of Na+ ions."

The resting membrane potential of -70 mV is closer to the equilibrium potential of K+ (-85 mV) than any of the other listed options.

The influx of other ions such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and Cl- is not significant in this context. The option of influx of Na+ ions might seem confusing since Na+ has a higher equilibrium potential than K+. However, the resting membrane potential is maintained by the balance between inward and outward movements of ions, and Na+ influx into the cell contributes to depolarization rather than hyperpolarization."

The resting membrane potential of -70 mV is closer to the equilibrium potential of potassium (-85 mV) than any other ion.

Potassium (K+) is the primary intracellular cation, and thus, its concentration plays a major role in determining the resting membrane potential of cells. At rest, K+ tends to move out of the cell down its concentration gradient, causing a negative charge to build up inside the cell. The equilibrium potential of K+ (-85 mV) is close to the resting membrane potential (-70 mV), indicating that K+ is the most important contributor to the difference between the two. Na+ and Ca2+ both have positive equilibrium potentials that are more positive than the resting membrane potential, meaning that their influx would lead to depolarization rather than hyperpolarization. Cl- has a negative equilibrium potential that is more negative than the resting membrane potential, meaning that its influx would also lead to depolarization. Mg2+ has a small positive equilibrium potential but does not play a significant role in determining the resting membrane potential. Therefore, the most important contributor to the difference between the resting membrane potential and the equilibrium potential of potassium is the influx of Na+ ions."
