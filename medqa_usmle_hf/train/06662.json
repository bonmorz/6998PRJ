The drug prescribed is likely an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine or meclizine, which are also known to have anticholinergic effects like dry mouth. Anticholinergic drugs block acetylcholine receptors, leading to less stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system and resulting in dry mouth."

The rash on the patient's leg is suggestive of a cutaneous reaction to a plant or insect bite, which is often treated with drugs like antihistamines that are effective for motion sickness. Dry mouth is a known adverse effect of antihistamines and is mediated through antagonism at acetylcholine receptors. Serotonin and adrenergic receptors are not involved in this response."

The drug used is likely to be a histamine antagonist, which can cause dry mouth due to antagonism at acetylcholine receptors. Answer choice A is unlikely as it mentions serotonin receptors, which are not typically involved in motion sickness or itchy rashes.

The rash is linear because the plant brushes against the skin in a straight line. Treatment with a drug effective for motion sickness suggests diphenhydramine, which has anticholinergic effects and can cause dry mouth. Therefore, the adverse effect is most likely mediated through antagonism at acetylcholine receptors."
