The question describes a normal physical exam and vital signs, with only a history of hypercholesterolemia and a family history of hypertension and myocardial infarction. The ECG shows a prolonged QT interval, indicating a lengthened ventricular repolarization. This could be a side effect of certain medications, electrolyte imbalances, or genetic disorders. It is important to rule out any underlying conditions and monitor the patient\u2019s condition."
