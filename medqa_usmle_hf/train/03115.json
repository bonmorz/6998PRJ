The most specific test to confirm this is to measure the level of methylmalonic acid, which is elevated in B12 deficiency. Intrinsic factor antibodies and the Schilling test are used to diagnose pernicious anemia, which is a cause of B12 deficiency, but they are not the best next step at this point. Folic acid supplementation may improve anemia but will not treat the underlying B12 deficiency."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, low hemoglobin and hematocrit, and elevated MCV all suggest a possible vitamin B12 deficiency.

Intrinsic factor antibody and Schilling test are used to diagnose pernicious anemia, which is caused by an autoimmune reaction on cells that produce intrinsic factor. Folic acid supplementation is not the correct answer as folic acid does not correct B12 deficiency symptoms."
