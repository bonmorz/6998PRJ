The medication mentioned in the question is likely to be a medication that affects serotonin, which is most commonly targeted in medications for sleep disorders. The raphe nucleus is located in the brainstem and is responsible for releasing serotonin. Priapism is a potential side effect of medications that target serotonin, such as antidepressants."

The symptom described by the patient is insomnia, and the possible medication that causes priapism suggests it is a medication for erectile dysfunction like sildenafil or tadalafil.
