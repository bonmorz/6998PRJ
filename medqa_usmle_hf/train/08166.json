The physical exam findings suggest achondroplasia, a genetic disorder that follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. This means that only one copy of the mutated gene is necessary for the disorder to be expressed. X-linked dominant and X-linked recessive patterns of inheritance are less likely as they often affect males more than females, and mitochondrial pattern of inheritance is characterized by maternal transmission."
