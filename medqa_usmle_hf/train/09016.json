The symptoms and laboratory findings suggest acute cholecystitis, and the imaging shows a distended gallbladder with thickened wall and pericholecystic fluid. The patient also has risk factors for complications such as diabetes and peripheral vascular disease. Intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam therapy and percutaneous cholecystostomy are the most appropriate next steps in management. Intravenous heparin therapy followed by embolectomy is not indicated in this case. Careful observation is not appropriate given the severity of the patient's symptoms and risk factors. Immediate cholecystectomy is not recommended due to the patient's recent coronary artery bypass surgery and high surgical risk."

The patient presents with signs and symptoms of acute cholecystitis, including fever, right upper quadrant pain, and a distended gallbladder on abdominal ultrasonography. The laboratory studies also show leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes. While immediate cholecystectomy is the definitive treatment, the patient's recent coronary artery bypass surgery makes this a high-risk procedure. Therefore, the most appropriate first step is intravenous antibiotics and percutaneous cholecystostomy to drain the infected gallbladder. Option A is incorrect as it is for arterial occlusion. Option B is incorrect as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results indicate acute cholecystitis, a potentially life-threatening condition that requires treatment. Option C is not an appropriate first step, as the patient's recent surgery makes this a high-risk procedure, and the priority is to manage the acute symptoms and infection."

The most appropriate next step would be to start intravenous antibiotics to treat the infection and perform a percutaneous cholecystostomy to drain the gallbladder while the patient is stabilized. Cholecystectomy can be performed later as a definitive treatment. Options A and B are not appropriate for acute cholecystitis, while option C can be risky given the patient's post-operative status."
