Emergency open fracture repair and exploratory laparoscopy may need to be performed later based on further evaluation. 100% oxygen can be administered after intubation to maintain oxygen saturation."

With evidence of trauma to the chest and abdomen, along with a distended and tender abdomen, there is a high risk of internal bleeding. The best initial step in management is to intubate the patient to maintain airway control and ensure adequate oxygenation. This will also allow for management of any potential respiratory distress that may arise. Once airway management is established, further diagnostic and therapeutic interventions such as emergency open fracture repair or exploratory laparoscopy can be considered. 100% oxygen may be administered, but it is not the best initial step in management given the patient\u2019s overall condition."
