Among the given options, only Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency fits the laboratory results, which show low levels of potassium, normal levels of leukocytes and platelets, and a high mean corpuscular volume. Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is an X-linked genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds, leading to elevated ammonia levels and metabolic acidosis."
