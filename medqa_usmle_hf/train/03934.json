This points to central retinal artery occlusion, which is a medical emergency that needs immediate intervention. The noted dilation of the left pupil is also characteristic of central retinal artery occlusion. Demyelinating optic neuritis is usually accompanied by pain upon eye movement, and temporal arteritis usually causes pain around the temporal area. Wet macular degeneration usually has a more gradual onset and does not cause sudden loss of vision."
