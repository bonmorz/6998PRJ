Intestinal metaplasia is a condition where the normal squamous cells of the esophagus are replaced by columnar cells that produce mucus, similar to those seen in the intestine. These cells are known as goblet cells. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) goblet cells. Keratinized stratified squamous epithelium is the normal tissue type found in the esophagus. Simple cuboidal epithelium is more commonly found in glandular tissue. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes are white blood cells that are involved in inflammation and fighting off infection, but they are not typically found in the esophagus in this context."
