Deficiency of clotting factor II (prothrombin) is responsible for the deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and can result from malabsorption. The other options are less likely causes and are not consistent with the presented symptoms and laboratory results."

The laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level and signs of coagulopathy with a prolonged prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and bleeding time. This points towards a possible bleeding disorder. Among the options, only deficiency of clotting factor II (also known as prothrombin) is a possible diagnosis."

The symptoms, such as abdominal pain, fatigue, bulky stool, ecchymoses, and mild distension of the abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds suggest Malabsorption syndromes. The laboratory tests showed a decrease in Hemoglobin and Mean corpuscular volume, and an increase in bleeding time and Partial thromboplastin time- which may indicate a deficiency of clotting factor II (also known as Prothrombin) since it is an essential part of the coagulation cascade. Factors VIII, protein S, and serum anti-phospholipid antibodies are not directly related to the symptoms and test results in this case."

The low hemoglobin and high mean corpuscular volume suggest a possible iron deficiency anemia. The scattered ecchymoses suggest easy bruising and bleeding. The prolonged prothrombin time indicates a deficiency of clotting factor II (also known as prothrombin). So, the correct answer is D. Deficiency of clotting factor VIII and increased activity of protein S are not associated with prolonged prothrombin time. Increased serum anti-phospholipid antibodies can cause an elevated partial thromboplastin time but would not prolong the prothrombin time."

The symptoms and laboratory studies suggest that the most likely diagnosis is cystic fibrosis, which can cause mucoid stools and malabsorption of nutrients. The scattered ecchymoses suggest a bleeding tendency, which can be caused by vitamin K deficiency due to malabsorption. Among the options, only deficiency of clotting factor II (also known as prothrombin) is consistent with the laboratory findings. Clotting factor VIII deficiency is known as hemophilia A, which typically presents with spontaneous bleeding into joints and muscles. Increased protein S activity and increased serum anti-phospholipid antibodies are associated with clotting disorders but not consistent with the laboratory findings."
