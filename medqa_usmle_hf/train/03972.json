The graph depicts a significant increase in mean arterial pressure and central venous pressure, indicating treatment for hypotension. Among the options, norepinephrine is commonly used in the treatment of septic shock, which this patient appears to be experiencing with an elevated temperature, low blood pressure, tachycardia, delayed capillary refill time, and high white blood cell count. Captopril is an ACE inhibitor used in hypertension, low-dose dopamine is used to increase urine output, and isoproterenol is used in cardiogenic shock."

Low-dose dopamine and isoproterenol can increase cardiac output, but they would not address the issue of low blood pressure in septic shock."

The patient is in septic shock with hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count. Low-dose dopamine and isoproterenol can increase heart rate and cardiac output but do not improve blood pressure. Captopril is an ACE inhibitor used to treat hypertension and heart failure, but not indicated in the treatment of septic shock. Norepinephrine is a vasopressor used to increase blood pressure and improve tissue perfusion in septic shock. Given the change in cardiovascular physiology when the medication is administered, the most likely answer is (D) Norepinephrine."

Norepinephrine is a vasopressor that can increase blood pressure and is commonly used in septic patients. The graph provided also shows an increase in mean arterial pressure after medication administration, further supporting the use of a vasopressor. Corticosteroids are also commonly used in sepsis but are not listed as an option. Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which is not appropriate in this acute situation. Low-dose dopamine can improve renal blood flow but is not a first-line treatment for septic shock. Isoproterenol is a beta-agonist that can increase heart rate but is not a vasopressor and may exacerbate hypotension."
