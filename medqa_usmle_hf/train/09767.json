Based on the information provided, the active substance binds to an allosteric site on globular portions of a heavy chain dimer. During muscle relaxation, this substance binds with greater affinity, which suggests that it binds to a site that is more accessible during muscle relaxation. The H band represents the region of the sarcomere where there is no overlap between the thin and thick filaments during muscle relaxation, making it the most likely location for the site with the greatest affinity for the active substance. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) II (represented on image as H band)."

The description in the question suggests that the substance binds with greater affinity during muscle relaxation, indicating that it is not involved in cross-bridge formation during muscle contraction. The globular head of the myosin filament binds with another contractile protein during muscle contraction, so the substance will have lesser affinity for the binding site. Therefore, the substance will have the greatest affinity during muscle relaxation, and the H band (represented as II) is the region where it is most likely to bind."

During muscle contraction, the I band and H band will decrease in size, while the A band remains constant. The M line is in the center of the sarcomere and does not change in size during muscle contraction. Therefore, the globular head of the heavy chain dimer will bind with the greatest affinity during muscle contraction in the H band. Answer choice (B) is correct."
