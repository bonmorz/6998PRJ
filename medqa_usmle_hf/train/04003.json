The presence of a mass in the anterior neck area, undetectable TSH, thyroid-receptor antibodies, and diffusely increased iodine uptake indicate a diagnosis of Graves disease. L-thyroxine therapy is a long-term treatment option for this condition. Near-total thyroidectomy may be considered in certain cases, but it is not the first line of treatment. Methimazole therapy and propranolol therapy may be used in the short term to manage symptoms, but L-thyroxine therapy is the long-term treatment."

Near-total thyroidectomy and methimazole therapy are other treatment options for hyperthyroidism, but they are less commonly used than radioactive iodine therapy. Propranolol therapy can be used for symptom control, but it does not address the underlying thyroid dysfunction."

Treatment with radioactive iodine will likely result in destruction of thyroid tissue, leading to hypothyroidism. Therefore, long-term therapy with L-thyroxine, a thyroid hormone replacement, will be required. Option A is incorrect because near-total thyroidectomy is not typically the first-line treatment for hyperthyroidism. Option B is incorrect because although methimazole can be used to treat hyperthyroidism, it is not a long-term solution and is typically used as a temporary measure before definitive therapy such as radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy. Option C is incorrect because while propranolol can be used to control the cardiovascular symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism, it does not treat the underlying condition."
