The patient's symptoms, including severe respiratory distress, agitated and tachypneic state, and crepitus on the left chest wall, strongly suggest a tension pneumothorax. The most appropriate next step in management is needle thoracostomy, which involves inserting a needle into the affected side of the chest to relieve pressure and allow for proper lung function. Endotracheal intubation and intravenous administration of fentanyl may be necessary at a later stage, but needle thoracostomy is a more emergent and immediate intervention.
