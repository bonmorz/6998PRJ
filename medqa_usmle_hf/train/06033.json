The presentation and laboratory results suggest renal cell carcinoma, which is known to present with hypertension and erythrocytosis (elevated hemoglobin).

Angiomyolipoma may also present with a mass in the kidney, but it is a benign tumor and not associated with hypertension or erythrocytosis. Transitional cell carcinoma and Wilms tumor occur more commonly in children, and Wilms tumor is typically associated with abdominal swelling and hypertension."

Transitional cell carcinoma and Wilms tumor are less common types of kidney cancer, and Wilms tumor is typically seen in children.
