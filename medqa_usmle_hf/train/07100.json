The other options do not fit as well with the described behavior."

This describes the phenomenon of people modifying their behavior when they know they are being observed, often in ways that improve their performance or productivity. In this scenario, the employees are performing their jobs with extra care, potentially improving their performance or productivity, because they know they are being observed. The other options do not fit the situation described. The Pygmalion effect is a phenomenon where people's beliefs about another person's abilities can influence that person's performance, but this is not directly relevant to the scenario. The novelty effect refers to a temporary increase in attention or arousal in response to a new stimulus, which is also not directly relevant. Observer bias refers to a systematic error in the way observer collects or interprets data, which does not fit the scenario either."
