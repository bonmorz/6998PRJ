Hamartomatous polyps are associated with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (PJS), which is caused by a mutation in the STK11 gene. PJS is associated with an increased risk of developing several cancers, including pancreatic carcinoma. Medulloblastoma is associated with another genetic syndrome, Gorlin Syndrome (also known as Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome), which is caused by a mutation in the PTCH1 gene. Malignant melanoma is not associated with PJS or hamartomatous polyps. Hepatocellular carcinoma is not commonly associated with PJS or hamartomatous polyps."
