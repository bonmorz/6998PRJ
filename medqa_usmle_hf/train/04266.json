Adverse effects of medications can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, but the colonoscopy findings do not support this. Cryptosporidium parvum can cause diarrhea in immunocompromised patients, but it typically does not cause bloody stools."

The patient has HIV and has irregularly taken efavirenz, which can weaken immunity, making the patient susceptible to infections like cytomegalovirus (CMV). The biopsy specimen confirms the inflammation and ulcers associated with CMV colitis. Hepatitis A virus is not associated with diarrhea and the patient's liver function tests are normal, making it an unlikely cause. Adverse effects of medications usually do not cause ulcers or inflammation throughout the colon. Cryptosporidium parvum can cause diarrhea but the biopsy specimen does not show the characteristic features of infection."

Hepatitis A does not cause diarrhea or bloody stools, and adverse effects of medications do not typically cause areas of inflammation or ulcerations on colonoscopy.

The patient's symptoms, including bloody stools and inflammation in the colon with shallow linear ulcerations, suggest cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.

Adverse effect of medications can be a possibility but the timing of the symptoms and the patient\u2019s history of irregular medication use make it less likely.
