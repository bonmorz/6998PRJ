The most likely cause of sudden death in a young athlete is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which can lead to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Narrowing of the left main coronary artery or a ventricular septal defect can also cause sudden death, but they are less common than HCM. Bicuspid aortic valve would not cause sudden death, but it is associated with aortic stenosis, which can cause sudden death in extreme cases."

The sudden death during physical activity suggests sudden cardiac arrest, which is often caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve is a common finding in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Narrowing of the left main coronary artery causes angina and myocardial infarction but may not result in sudden death. Bicuspid aortic valve and ventricular septum defect may cause heart murmurs, but are less likely to lead to sudden cardiac arrest in a previously healthy young adult."
