The half-life of a drug is the time required for the concentration or amount of the drug in the body to be reduced by half. From the information provided, we can calculate the half-life of Drug A at Time 1 to be 4/2 / 1 = 2 minutes and at Time 2 to be 2/2 / 0.5 = 2 minutes. This suggests that the half-life of Drug A is constant. However, for Drug B, the half-life at Time 1 is 3/2 / 4 = 0.75 minutes while at Time 2 it is 15/2 / 4 = 1.875 minutes. This indicates that the half-life of Drug B is variable. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) - The half-life of drug A is constant but that of drug B is variable."

Based on the data provided, the elimination rate of Drug A decreases from 1 mg/minute to 0.5 mg/minute between Time 1 and Time 2, while the concentration of Drug A decreases from 4 mg/dl to 2 mg/dl, indicating a longer half-life for Drug A at Time 2. Conversely, the elimination rate of Drug B remains constant between Time 1 and Time 2 at 4 mg/minute, while the concentration of Drug B increases from 3 mg/dl to 15 mg/dl, indicating a shorter half-life for Drug B at Time 2. Therefore, the half-life of drug A is constant but that of drug B is variable (Option B)."
