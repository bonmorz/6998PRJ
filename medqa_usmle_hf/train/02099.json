The symptoms suggest Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which is a severe and life-threatening skin reaction associated with some medications. The annular, erythematous macules, bullae, and desquamation of the palms and soles are characteristic symptoms of this syndrome. There is no significant lymphadenopathy, which distinguishes it from pemphigus vulgaris. Bullous pemphigoid typically presents with tense blisters, while Drug-induced lupus erythematosus is associated with joint pain, fever, and rashes on the face or other areas exposed to UV light."
