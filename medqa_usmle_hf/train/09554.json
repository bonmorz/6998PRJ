The history of cholecystectomy suggests a potential bile acid malabsorption leading to fat malabsorption and fatty, foul-smelling stools. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s bleeding is vitamin K deficiency. Hemophilia and ITP are conditions that primarily affect platelet function, and the PTT is within normal range, indicating that these are unlikely causes. Von Willebrand disease affects both clotting factors and platelets, but a normal ristocetin cofactor assay rules this out as a cause."
