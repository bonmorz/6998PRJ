The patient's symptoms, including facial flushing, sensation of fullness, and itching after shower, suggest polycythemia vera, which is characterized by increased production of red blood cells leading to increased blood viscosity and decreased blood flow. The elevated hemoglobin level in the complete blood count supports this diagnosis. The lack of blast cells, M-spike of immunoglobulin M, or abnormalities in erythropoietin or ferritin levels rules out the other options. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) \u2191 Blood viscosity, \u2193 blood flow, \u2193 erythropoietin."

The high hemoglobin level supports this diagnosis. Option A describes leukemia, option B describes iron-deficiency anemia, and option C describes Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, all of which are unlikely diagnoses given the presentation. Therefore, option D is the most likely set of abnormalities in this patient, where there is an increased blood viscosity, decreased blood flow, and decreased erythropoietin."

The patient has symptoms of polycythemia vera, which is characterized by an increased hemoglobin level and a palpable spleen. The associated symptoms such as facial flushing, itching, and headaches are due to hyperviscosity of the blood, which can decrease blood flow. The treatment for polycythemia vera is to reduce the viscosity and blood flow, which is achieved by phlebotomy, low-dose aspirin therapy, and hydroxyurea. Thus, the correct answer is option (D), i.e. \u2191 Blood viscosity, \u2193 blood flow, \u2193 erythropoietin."

The patient presents with facial flushing, headaches, fullness in the head and neck, and severe itching after hot showers, which are all symptoms of polycythemia vera. His blood pressure is high, and his spleen is noted to be palpable, indicating potential complications of this condition. A complete blood count shows elevated hemoglobin levels, leukocyte count within normal range, and elevated platelet count, which are all characteristic of polycythemia vera. Therefore, the most likely set of abnormalities present in this patient is the combination of high blood viscosity, decreased blood flow, and decreased erythropoietin levels, as seen in polycythemia vera."
