Myosin-binding protein C is typically found in cardiac myocytes and mutations in this gene have been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The sudden death of the patient's father during exercise is consistent with this diagnosis. The likely finding on histological evaluation of his heart at autopsy would be myocyte disarray, a characteristic feature of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Amyloid deposits are associated with amyloidosis, eosinophilic infiltration is associated with eosinophilic myocarditis, and wavy myocytes are associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, all of which are less likely given the patient's family history and clinical presentation."
