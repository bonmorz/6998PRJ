The patient is showing signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus, including a bulging anterior fontanelle and enlarged ventricles on MRI. The most appropriate treatment in this case would be a ventriculoperitoneal shunt to divert the cerebrospinal fluid from the brain to the peritoneum. Cerebral aqueductoplasty is not appropriate in this case as the enlargement of all four ventricles suggest a generalized obstruction rather than a specific area. Furosemide and acetazolamide are diuretics that may be used in some cases of hydrocephalus but are not the first-line treatment for this patient's symptoms."
