The symptoms - difficulty feeding, regurgitation, small head circumference and weight, mandibular hypoplasia, widely-spaced eyes, single palmar crease, and pansystolic murmur along the left lower sternal border- suggest Trisomy 5 or Cri du chat syndrome, which are both caused by microdeletion at chromosome 5. X-linked gene mutation, translocation at chromosome 21, and maternal hypothyroidism do not fit the symptoms."

The combination of feeding difficulties, small head circumference, and facial features (mandibular hypoplasia, broad nasal bridge, widely-spaced eyes, round face, down-slanting palpebral fissures, and single palmar crease) suggests a diagnosis of Cri-du-chat syndrome, which is caused by a microdeletion at chromosome 5. X-linked gene mutations can cause conditions like hemophilia or Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which do not present with these specific symptoms. Translocation at chromosome 21 is associated with Down syndrome, which has a different set of characteristic features. Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy can cause developmental delays and intellectual disability in the child, but does not present with the specific combination of symptoms seen in this patient."

This syndrome can also cause feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, and congenital heart defects, which would explain the pansystolic murmur heard on exam. X-linked gene mutations would not lead to such distinctive physical features. Translocations at chromosome 21 would suggest Down syndrome, which does not typically cause mandibular hypoplasia. Maternal hypothyroidism can lead to developmental delays, but it would not explain the specific physical findings noted here."
