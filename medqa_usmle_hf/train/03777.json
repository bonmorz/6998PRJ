The presence of fatty acids in the duodenum triggers the release of cholecystokinin (CCK), which causes the I cells of the duodenum to release secretin, a hormone that ultimately leads to sphincter relaxation. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. Option (B) is incorrect, as the sphincter is actually relaxed between meals. Option (C) is incorrect, as stimulation of opioid receptors would lead to sphincter constriction rather than relaxation. Option (D) is also incorrect, as there is no hormone released specifically by the M cells of the duodenum that causes sphincter relaxation."

The hormone released by the I cells of the duodenum in the presence of fatty acids is cholecystokinin (CCK), which causes relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi, allowing for the release of bile and pancreatic enzymes into the small intestine. This can be important during ERCP, as cannulation of the pancreatic duct may be difficult if the sphincter is constricted. Option (B) may be true, but it does not address the specific situation in this patient. Option (C) is not accurate, as opioid receptor stimulation causes sphincter constriction. Option (D) may be partly true, as there are various hormones and neurotransmitters that can regulate the sphincter, but CCK is the most effective cause of relaxation."
