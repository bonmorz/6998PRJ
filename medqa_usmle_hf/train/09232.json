Acute angle-closure glaucoma typically presents with unilateral symptoms, and bacterial endophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis do not typically cause bilateral proptosis and eye muscle weakness in all directions."

The other options are less likely given the patient\u2019s symptoms and presentation. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is characterized by sudden onset of elevated intraocular pressure and severe eye pain, which is not found in this patient. Bacterial endophthalmitis typically presents with pain, redness, and decreased vision, and there is no mention of these symptoms in the scenario. Orbital cellulitis typically presents with pain, redness, and swelling but does not have the neurological symptoms seen in this patient."
