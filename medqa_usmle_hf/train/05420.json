Finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor that decreases the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which leads to decreased prostate size due to increased apoptosis of prostatic cells. This would improve urinary flow and alleviate symptoms of urinary hesitancy and poor urinary stream. None of the other options are consistent with the pharmacological effects of finasteride."

It works by reducing dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, which ultimately leads to reduced prostate size through apoptosis of prostatic cells. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect as finasteride does not affect internal urethral sphincter tone. Option (C) is incorrect as finasteride does not affect penile blood flow. Option (D) is incorrect as finasteride does not affect bladder contractions."
