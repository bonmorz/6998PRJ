The left coronary artery branches into the left anterior descending artery and the left circumflex artery. The left circumflex artery supplies the lateral wall of the left ventricle and passes over the roof of the left atrium. Therefore, in order to reach the site of the lesion, the catheter must pass through the left coronary artery and left circumflex artery. Option (A) is correct."
