The correct answer is to treat her partner for gonorrhea and chlamydia to prevent reinfection, and to inform her partner of the positive test result so that they can get tested and treated as well. Additionally, the patient should be counseled on safe sex practices and the importance of regular screening for sexually transmitted infections. Penicillin G is not necessary as there is no indication of syphilis, and abdominal ultrasonography is not needed unless there are signs or symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease. There is no evidence to suggest that her partner is necessarily cheating on her, and making that assumption could lead to unnecessary conflict in the relationship."
