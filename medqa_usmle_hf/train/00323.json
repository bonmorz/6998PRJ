While acute renal failure or acute liver failure may be possible, there are no laboratory values or physical exam findings that suggest these conditions. Bitemporal hemianopsia may indicate a pituitary tumor, but the patient's hoarseness and thyroid mass suggest a more likely diagnosis of thyroid cancer."
