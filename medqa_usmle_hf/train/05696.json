The patient is presenting with symptoms of adrenal crisis, which is a life-threatening condition that can occur after surgery. The patient\u2019s history of Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis suggests an autoimmune condition and increases the risk of adrenal crisis. High-dose hydrocortisone is the appropriate treatment for adrenal crisis. Noncontrast CT of the head would not be helpful in this situation. Intravenous hypotonic saline infusion can exacerbate the patient\u2019s hypotension. CT angiogram of the abdomen may not be helpful in diagnosing adrenal crisis."
