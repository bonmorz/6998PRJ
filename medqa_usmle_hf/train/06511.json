The patient\u2019s symptoms, along with her age and past medical history, suggest that she may have polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). The best initial step in management is to assess for inflammation by checking the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). A high ESR would support a diagnosis of PMR and confirm the need for treatment with steroids. A lumbar puncture, electromyography, and antinuclear antibody testing are not necessary at this time and would not aid in the diagnosis of PMR."

The symptoms suggest a possible case of polymyalgia rheumatica, which is associated with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Therefore, the best next step in management would be to perform an ESR test. Lumbar puncture is unlikely to be helpful in this case as the patient is presenting with muscular symptoms rather than neurological symptoms. Electromyography (EMG) is used to diagnose muscle and nerve diseases and may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica, but it is not a first-line investigation. Antinuclear antibody testing is used to diagnose autoimmune diseases but is less likely to be relevant in this case as the patient's symptoms suggest a possible inflammatory condition rather than an autoimmune condition."
