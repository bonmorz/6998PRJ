The most common mutation is the delta F508 mutation, which results in a defective protein that causes thick mucus to accumulate in the lungs and pancreas. Nasal polyps are also commonly seen in patients with CF. The absence of vas deferens is a common complication of CF in males due to blockage of the vas deferens by thick mucus. Hypersensitivity to aspirin and selective IgA deficiency are not associated with CF. Positive methacholine challenge test is used to diagnose asthma."
