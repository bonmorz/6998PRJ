The patient has strictures in the mid-ileum, and since they are discrete and 20 cm apart, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform strictureplasty of individual strictures. This procedure involves widening the narrowed section of the intestine, allowing for improved passage of stool and reducing the risk of further bowel obstructions. Ileocolectomy or small bowel resection with ileostomy may be necessary if there are multiple or extensive strictures, but in this case, strictureplasty is the more appropriate option. Abdominal closure and starting palliative care would not be appropriate at this stage, as there are still treatment options available to manage the obstruction."
