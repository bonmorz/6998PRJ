The patient\u2019s lack of pubic hair, absence of cervical os, and high blood pressure suggest 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. The low potassium level in the serum is also a hallmark of this condition. This deficiency results in decreased hormone production, leading to primary amenorrhea and delayed puberty."

Additionally, the patient's lack of pubic hair is consistent with this diagnosis. 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency and 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency would not cause a lack of pubic hair. 5-alpha reductase deficiency would cause ambiguous genitalia at birth, which is not present in this patient."

The lab results show a low potassium concentration, elevated BUN and elevated creatinine levels, which suggest adrenal insufficiency. The most likely diagnosis is 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency, which can cause hypertension, lack of secondary sexual characteristics, and adrenal insufficiency. 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency can also cause adrenal insufficiency but does not typically cause hypertension. 5-alpha reductase deficiency causes male genitalia ambiguity and does not usually cause hypertension. 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency can cause hypertension, but it leads to virilization and not the lack of pubic hair."
