The patient\u2019s presentation suggests a potential corneal abrasion, and the best initial step in management would be to perform a fluorescein stain to assess for any corneal defects. Orbital MRI may be indicated if there is suspicion of a more serious injury such as a foreign body or retrobulbar hematoma, but this is not the best initial step. Tonometry may be done to assess for intraocular pressure, but this will not assess for a corneal defect. Topical corticosteroids may be used for certain eye conditions, but they would not be appropriate until the underlying problem is identified, as they could worsen a corneal abrasion."
