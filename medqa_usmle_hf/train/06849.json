Defects in heme or globin synthesis do not typically cause macrocytic anemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome is less likely given the patient's history of diabetes."

The laboratory results also support this diagnosis, as the hematocrit is low, the MCV is high, and the corrected reticulocyte index is low.
