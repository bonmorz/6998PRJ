This is supported by the patient\u2019s history of peanut allergy and the rapid onset of symptoms after being exposed to a potential allergen. Types 2 and 3 hypersensitivity reactions involve different mechanisms and do not typically present with the same constellation of symptoms. Option D is incorrect as Type 2 hypersensitivity reactions involve antibody-mediated destruction of cells and tissues, and this patient\u2019s symptoms do not suggest this pathophysiology."

The patient\u2019s symptoms include facial flushing, difficulty breathing, itching, edema, and audible stridor, which are consistent with an anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction. Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions involve the immediate release of histamines and other chemicals in response to an allergen or antigen, resulting in symptoms such as those experienced by the patient. Type 2 hypersensitivity reactions involve cytotoxic antibodies attacking cells or tissues, and Type 3 hypersensitivity reactions involve immune complexes depositing in tissues and causing inflammation. Neither of these types of reactions fully account for the patient\u2019s symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Type 1 - anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction."

The symptoms and past medical history of peanut allergy suggest that the patient is experiencing a Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, which is also known as an anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction. This type of reaction occurs when the body produces IgE antibodies in response to exposure to an allergen, such as peanuts, leading to the release of histamine and other proinflammatory mediators that cause symptoms such as facial flushing, edema, and difficulty breathing. There is no evidence to suggest that this patient is experiencing a Type 2 or Type 3 hypersensitivity reaction, which involve different immune mechanisms.

The patient has a history of peanut allergy and is experiencing symptoms of anaphylaxis after being exposed to peanut butter treats. Anaphylaxis is a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, which is an immediate immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated response to an allergen. Type 2 is a cytotoxic hypersensitivity which involves IgM and IgG antibodies directed at target antigens, while type 3 involves immune complex deposition in tissues. Both A and B are incorrect options as only Type 1 is the correct type of hypersensitivity reaction."
