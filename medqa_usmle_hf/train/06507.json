The patient is presenting with weakness and muscle fatigue, abnormal laboratory values are not present, and medications can cause muscle damage. However, the patient's symptoms could indicate hypothyroidism, which is associated with muscle weakness. Therefore, the best next step in management would be to check the patient's TSH level. Option (A) may be a consideration if the patient's symptoms are due to statin-induced myopathy, but this would not be the first line of management. Option (B) may be considered as a supplement to address possible statin-induced myopathy, but it would not directly address the patient's symptoms. Option (D) may be considered if the TSH level is normal and other causes of muscle weakness have been ruled out."

The patient has a history of constipation, anxiety, and atopic dermatitis, which can be suggestive of hypothyroidism. The presence of thinning hair and the low-normal TSH level can also be supportive of hypothyroidism. Therefore, the best next step in management would be to check the TSH level. Discontinuing atorvastatin or administering Coenzyme Q10 may be considered in cases of statin-induced myopathy, but further investigation is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Muscle biopsy is not indicated at this point and should only be considered in cases where a definitive diagnosis of a muscle disorder cannot be made by other means."

A muscle biopsy can confirm a diagnosis of myopathy, but it\u2019s an invasive procedure and not the best initial diagnostic step.
