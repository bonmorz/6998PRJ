The diagnosis of syphilis is confirmed by darkfield microscopy and the rash on the palms is characteristic of secondary syphilis. Saddle nose is a common finding in congenital syphilis and occurs due to destruction of the nasal cartilage. Vision loss and chorioretinitis can occur in congenital syphilis but are less common. Muscular atrophy is not a known complication of syphilis. Therefore, the correct answer is B, saddle nose."
