The location of the patient\u2019s trip to Brazil and the symptoms suggest Schistosoma mansoni infection, as it is common in Brazil and can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, and fever. Onchocerca volvulus is a parasite that affects the skin and eyes, but is not common in Brazil. Vibrio cholerae causes profuse watery diarrhea, which is not described in the patient\u2019s symptoms. Schistosoma japonicum is more common in China, and the symptoms are similar to Schistosoma mansoni, but the patient\u2019s recent trip to Brazil makes this option less likely."
