Herd immunity describes the indirect protection against an infectious disease that occurs when a large percentage of a population has become immune to the disease, either through vaccination or previous infection. In this scenario, the other children in daycare who have been vaccinated against these diseases provide herd immunity to the unvaccinated child, reducing the likelihood of transmission. Genetic shift refers to changes in the genetic makeup of a virus that causes significant alterations in its antigenic properties, immune evasion refers to mechanisms by which pathogens are able to evade the immune system, and tolerance refers to the immune system's ability to recognize self-antigens and not mount an immune response against them."

Herd immunity is the phenomenon where a high level of vaccination within a community provides indirect protection to individuals who are not vaccinated. The reduction in the number of susceptible individuals within the community decreases the likelihood of transmission and reduces the overall risk of outbreak. As a result, even those who are not vaccinated, such as the 1-year-old girl in this scenario, are less likely to contract vaccine-preventable diseases due to the herd immunity effect."
