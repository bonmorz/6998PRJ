The normal leukocyte count suggests that the symptoms are not due to an infection, but the constipation, muscle and joint pain, and change in memory are consistent with heavy metal exposure. Iron deficiency can also cause anemia but does not explain the other symptoms. Guillain-Barre syndrome is a neurological disorder that presents with weakness and numbness, which the patient does not have. Systemic lupus erythematosus can cause fatigue and joint pain but does not explain the anemia or constipation. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is heavy metal exposure."
