The undetectable levels of all serum immunoglobulins point to a diagnosis of Bruton agammaglobulinemia, an X-linked disorder in which affected individuals cannot produce mature B cells, leading to a lack of immunoglobulins and increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. The family history of similar complaints also suggests a genetic disorder, and this is further supported by the fact that two maternal uncles died from similar complaints. Common variable immunodeficiency and DiGeorge syndrome have different immunological profiles, while hereditary angioedema is not associated with recurrent bacterial infections."

Hereditary angioedema is a disorder of the complement system and does not typically present with recurrent bacterial infections.
