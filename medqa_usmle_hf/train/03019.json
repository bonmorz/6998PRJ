The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest an acute exacerbation of COPD, likely due to a bacterial infection. The most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy is Prednisone and albuterol, as Prednisone helps reduce airway inflammation and albuterol helps to open up the airways. Albuterol and montelukast may be used for maintenance treatment, but they are not appropriate for acute exacerbation. Theophylline may have bronchodilator effects but is not recommended as initial therapy."
