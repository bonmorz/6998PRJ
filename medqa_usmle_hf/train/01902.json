Hamartoma of the hypothalamus can cause precocious puberty, but the patient\u2019s physical changes are consistent with normal puberty. Mosaic G-protein mutation can cause McCune-Albright syndrome, which can also cause precocious puberty, but there are no other symptoms consistent with this condition. A functioning follicular ovarian cyst can secrete hormones that may lead to abnormal uterine bleeding, but it is not likely to cause the physical changes described in this patient."

Mosaic G-protein mutation is associated with McCune-Albright syndrome which can also cause early puberty, but again, it is unlikely in this case. Functioning follicular ovarian cyst can cause hormonal imbalances, but the patient's presentation is not consistent with it."
