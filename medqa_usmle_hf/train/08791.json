Normal human hemoglobin exhibits a left-shifted oxygen dissociation curve, meaning it has a high affinity for oxygen in the lungs and readily picks up oxygen molecules to transport throughout the body. Therefore, the scientist should expect to observe a left-shifted curve and increased oxygen binding in the synthetic hemoglobin if it mimics the behavior of normal hemoglobin. The reduction of carbon dioxide levels in the system helps to shift the curve to the left."
