Nitric oxide plays a crucial role in the regulation of coronary blood flow by mediating vasodilation of the coronary arteries. It is released by the endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of the coronary blood vessels in response to various stimuli, including shear stress and metabolic demands. While norepinephrine and histamine are involved in the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure, they are not specifically responsible for the maintenance of coronary blood flow. VEGF is important in angiogenesis and vascular permeability but is not directly involved in the regulation of coronary blood flow."
