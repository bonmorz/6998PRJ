The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest hyperkalemia, which can cause the abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and ECG changes. Among the options, only inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase can cause hyperkalemia. This is because this pump is responsible for the active transport of potassium into cells, and inhibition of the pump can lead to an increase in extracellular potassium. The patient's congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation suggest that he may be on digoxin, which is known to inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase and can cause hyperkalemia."
