The patient has a blood pressure of 138/95 mm Hg, which is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of preeclampsia. As this is an initial prenatal visit, there is no prior history of hypertension or evidence of proteinuria, which are required for a diagnosis of chronic hypertension or preeclampsia, respectively. Therefore, the most likely condition is high normal blood pressure, which can occur during pregnancy and may require monitoring and management to prevent progression to preeclampsia."
