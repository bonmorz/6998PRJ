The patient's symptoms suggest venous insufficiency, which is characterized by swelling, pain, and itching in the legs, and is worse at the end of the day. The presence of pitting edema and reddish-brown discoloration is also suggestive of venous insufficiency. Type IV hypersensitivity reaction is not likely as there is no history of recent exposure to an allergen. Malignant proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes is not likely as the patient had basal cell carcinoma 4 years ago and there is no evidence of a new lesion. Dermal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans is associated with conditions such as scleroderma, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms."
