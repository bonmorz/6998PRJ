Taut skin, limited range of motion of the fingers, and telangiectasias over the cheeks indicate possible systemic sclerosis, which can cause esophageal dysmotility. Amyloid deposits in the liver are associated with amyloidosis, which can affect multiple organs but is not specifically related to esophageal dysmotility. Budding yeasts on the oral mucosa suggest Candidiasis, which is not related to esophageal dysmotility. Parasite nests in the myocardium suggest Chagas disease, which can cause esophageal dysmotility but is more likely to be associated with findings such as conduction abnormalities on electrocardiogram. Arteriolar wall thickening in the kidney is associated with a variety of renal diseases but is not specifically related to esophageal dysmotility. Thus, the most likely answer is (A) Amyloid deposits in the liver. However, it is important to note that further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis of systemic sclerosis and its association with amyloidosis."
