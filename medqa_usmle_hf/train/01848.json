The symptoms suggest growing pains, which is a common condition in children characterized by crampy pain in the legs that occur primarily before bedtime.

Therefore, reassurance and lifestyle modifications, such as massaging the legs, are the most appropriate next step in management. The other options, such as antinuclear antibody testing and pramipexole therapy, are not indicated as they are not relevant to this condition. An X-ray of the lower extremities may be useful to rule out other underlying conditions such as bone tumors or fractures but is not indicated as the symptoms are consistent with growing pains."
