This is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that commonly presents as an abdominal mass in children. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings support this diagnosis. Wilms tumor is another common pediatric abdominal cancer, but it typically presents with hematuria and hypertension. Hepatoblastoma is a type of liver cancer that may present with a palpable abdominal mass, but it is less common than Burkitt lymphoma in this population. Neuroblastoma may also present with an abdominal mass but typically affects infants and young children and may cause other symptoms such as diarrhea and weight loss."
