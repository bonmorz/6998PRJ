Positive interferon-gamma release assay is seen in tuberculosis, not sarcoidosis. Low serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels are seen in some cases of sarcoidosis, but not always. Positive anti-dsDNA antibody testing is associated with autoimmune diseases such as lupus, which would not explain the patient's symptoms in this case."
