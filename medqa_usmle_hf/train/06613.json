The presence of mobile smooth masses below the areola bilaterally with no discharge and no other physical exam findings, together with the patient's history, is most likely a case of gynecomastia, which is the benign enlargement of male breast tissue. Therefore, testicular atrophy is the most likely physical exam finding to be seen in this individual as it can be a potential cause of gynecomastia."
