Measurement of antistreptolysin O titer and antiviral capsid antigen IgM antibody are not necessary at this time.

A rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococci is negative, but it may yield false negatives in up to 25% of cases. Therefore, obtaining a throat culture is the most appropriate next step in management to confirm or rule out the diagnosis and determine appropriate treatment. Measurement of antistreptolysin O titer is not useful in the acute setting for diagnosis. Measurement of antiviral capsid antigen IgM antibody is not useful in the absence of a suspected viral cause. While penicillin V therapy may be appropriate if the culture confirms group A streptococcal infection, obtaining a culture first is necessary to guide appropriate treatment."
