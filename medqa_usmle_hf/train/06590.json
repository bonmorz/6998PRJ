The isoform of elastase that is normally inhibited by TIMPs is produced by neutrophils, which are responsible for phagocytosis of foreign material. They are also involved in the immune response and inflammation. Option A is incorrect because degradation of toxins is usually done by the liver. Option B is incorrect because diffusion of gases occurs in the respiratory system, but it is not specifically related to neutrophil function. Option D is incorrect because mucus secretion is primarily done by goblet cells."
