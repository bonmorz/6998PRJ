A normal barium swallow X-ray may suggest the need for further diagnostic tests to determine the underlying cause of the symptoms. Manometry tests are used to evaluate muscle contractions in the esophagus and can help diagnose conditions such as achalasia, which can cause difficulty swallowing and retrosternal chest pain. An electrocardiogram is used to evaluate heart function and would not aid in the diagnosis of this patient's condition. Upper GI endoscopy may be useful in some cases to visualize the esophagus and stomach, but manometry would be a more specific diagnostic test in this scenario. Additional therapy with proton pump inhibitors has already been tried for 8 weeks and has not resolved the patient's symptoms, making it unlikely to be helpful as a diagnostic tool."
