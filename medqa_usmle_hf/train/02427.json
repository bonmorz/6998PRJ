The presence of an irregularly bordered red patch in a patient with poor dentition and daily tobacco use is highly concerning for oral cancer. The correct option is to suggest a biopsy for definitive diagnosis and management. The other options are incorrect, as an infection is unlikely to present for several months without causing pain, the lesion is associated with an increased risk of cancer, and tobacco use is a significant risk factor for oral cancer."
