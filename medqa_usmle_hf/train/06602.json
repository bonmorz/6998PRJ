The patient underwent chemotherapy with doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel, which supports doxorubicin as the most likely cause of her dilated cardiomyopathy. Radiation therapy can cause cardiac complications, but the presentation is usually late after therapy and involves subendocardial fibrosis rather than dilated cardiomyopathy. Cyclophosphamide can cause cardiac toxicity, but it is less frequent and usually manifests as arrhythmias rather than dilated cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis is less likely given the normal baseline echocardiogram and electrocardiogram prior to starting chemotherapy."
