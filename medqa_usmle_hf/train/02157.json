The symptoms of sore throat, cough, and fever, along with an edematous tongue and grey-white membrane on the tonsils suggest a diagnosis of diphtheria caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Diphtheria can be prevented through vaccination, which is why the patient\u2019s immunization status is important to know. Haemophilus influenzae b can also cause meningitis and epiglottitis, but these diseases are not suggested by the symptoms. Agranulocytosis is a condition in which the body produces low levels of certain white blood cells, and it is not caused by an infectious agent. Epstein Barr virus causes infectious mononucleosis, but the symptoms and presentation are different from diphtheria."
