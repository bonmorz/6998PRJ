The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia, which is supported by laboratory findings such as low hemoglobin, high reticulocyte count, and the presence of blister cells and Heinz bodies on peripheral smear. The presence of gallstones also suggests increased hemolysis. Among the options, the methemoglobin reduction test is used to diagnose glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, which is a common cause of hemolytic anemia in African Americans. Glycerol lysis test is used to diagnose hereditary spherocytosis, which can also cause hemolytic anemia. Serum thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone are unlikely to be useful in this case. Hepatoiminodiacetic acid scanning is used to diagnose gallbladder and biliary tract diseases but does not provide information about the underlying cause of the hemolytic anemia."

The patient has symptoms of hemolytic anemia (jaundice, splenomegaly, blister cells, Heinz bodies) and the presence of gallstones suggests chronic hemolysis. The most useful test to diagnose this patient is the methemoglobin reduction test, which measures the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme, since G6PD deficiency is the most common cause of acute hemolytic anemia. A glycerol lysis test can also be used to diagnose G6PD deficiency, but the methemoglobin reduction test is more sensitive. Serum thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone would be useful in diagnosing thyroid disorders, which are not likely to be the cause of this patient\u2019s symptoms. Hepatoiminodiacetic acid scanning is a form of nuclear imaging used to diagnose biliary tract obstruction or liver function, which are not the primary concerns in this case."
