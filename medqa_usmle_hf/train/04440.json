The patient\u2019s medications, specifically risperidone, can cause hyperprolactinemia, which can lead to amenorrhea and breast changes. Risperidone is a dopamine receptor antagonist, which can cause an increase in prolactin levels. Option A refers to polycystic ovary syndrome, which presents with irregular menstrual cycles but breast changes and nipple discharge are not typical. Option B refers to prolactinoma, but there is no evidence of an underlying mass or increased prolactin levels. Option C refers to hypothyroidism, which can also cause menstrual irregularities, but there is no evidence of an underlying thyroid disorder."
