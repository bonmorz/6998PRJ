The holosystolic murmur in 4th intercostal space along the left sternal border is characteristic of tricuspid regurgitation, which occurs due to the back-flow of blood from the right ventricle to the right atrium during systole. During inspiration, intrathoracic pressure decreases, leading to increased venous return to the right heart and increased right ventricular stroke volume. This increase in stroke volume causes an increase in the severity of tricuspid regurgitation, resulting in a louder murmur. None of the other options explains the increase in murmur during inspiration."
