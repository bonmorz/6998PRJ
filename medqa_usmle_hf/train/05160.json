Male internal and external reproductive structures are developed from the Wolffian ducts, which are stimulated by the presence of testosterone produced by Leydig cells, and inhibited by Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) produced by Sertoli cells. The lack of a uterus suggests that the MIS produced by Sertoli cells has caused the regression of Mullerian ducts, which would have developed into a uterus if not inhibited. Thus, the correct answer is Sertoli cells."
