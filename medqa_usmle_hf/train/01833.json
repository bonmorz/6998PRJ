The presentation is consistent with conversion disorder, which is a psychiatric condition in which psychological stressors manifest as physical symptoms. There are no abnormal findings on the imaging tests that would suggest an organic cause for the symptoms. Malingering is a conscious and intentional production of false or exaggerated symptoms for external gain. Somatic symptom disorder involves persistent and excessive anxiety about physical symptoms or health concerns, but no neurological deficits. Acute hemorrhagic stroke would have shown abnormalities on the CT scan of the head."

The absence of abnormalities on the CT scan of the head, MRI of the brain and MR angiography supports this diagnosis. Malingering involves intentionally faking symptoms to gain a secondary gain, while somatic symptom disorder involves excessive preoccupation with physical symptoms without evidence of organic disease.

The fact that the patient is unable to provide a history and appears anxious suggests a conversion disorder, which is a condition in which psychological stressors cause physical symptoms. The normal CT scan and MRI also support this diagnosis, as there are no abnormalities that would suggest a physical cause for the weakness and unsteadiness. Malingering is the intentional exaggeration or fabrication of symptoms for secondary gain. Somatic symptom disorder is a condition in which a person has excessive and distressing thoughts and behaviors related to physical symptoms, but there is no evidence of a physical cause. Acute hemorrhagic stroke would show abnormalities on imaging."

The absence of any abnormalities on the imaging scans and the patient\u2019s recent job loss and increased isolation are also consistent with this diagnosis. Malingering is deliberately feigning symptoms for a secondary gain, which is not suggested in this case. Somatic symptom disorder involves excessive and persistent thoughts and anxiety about physical symptoms, which is not apparent in this case. Acute hemorrhagic stroke would likely have abnormalities on imaging scans that were not present in this case."

The patient's symptoms are neurological and affecting only one side, but no abnormalities are found on imaging studies. This suggests a functional disorder, such as conversion disorder, rather than a structural problem like an acute hemorrhagic stroke. Malingering is when a patient fakes or exaggerates symptoms for personal gain, but there is no indication of this in the scenario. Somatic symptom disorder involves persistent physical symptoms without an apparent medical explanation, but it is not likely to cause neurological deficits affecting only one side."
