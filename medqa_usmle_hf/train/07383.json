The direct Coombs test is positive in AIHA because it detects antibodies attached to the surface of the patient's red blood cells. Typical blood smear findings include spherocytes, which are small, round red blood cells. The indirect Coombs test is positive if serum contains antibodies against red blood cells. Heinz bodies are not typically seen in AIHA, but rather in other types of anemia."

The scenario suggests that the patient developed drug-induced AIHA as a result of switching from enalapril to methyldopa. The direct Coombs test detects antibodies on red blood cells, not in the serum, so (A) is incorrect. Spherocytes are common findings in AIHA, making (B) the correct answer.
