CLL is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal lymphocytes in the blood and bone marrow, leading to an elevated white blood cell count. The peripheral blood smear typically shows small mature-looking lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm, giving the appearance of \"smudge cells.\" Both the hemoglobin and platelet count are within normal limits for CLL, unlike acute leukemias where they are often decreased. Adult T cell leukemia is associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection, which is not mentioned in the question stem."
