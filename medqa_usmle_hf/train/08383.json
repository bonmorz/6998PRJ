Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia means that the liver is not processing bilirubin properly, which is not indicated in this case. Decreased urine urobilinogen would suggest a problem with the breakdown of red blood cells and not with the liver. Elevated aspartate aminotransferase would indicate liver damage or injury but would not necessarily explain the patient\u2019s other symptoms. Absent urine bilirubin is the most likely finding because bilirubin is not being excreted properly, leading to the yellowing of the skin and dark urine. This may be caused by an infectious or inflammatory process, such as hepatitis. Further tests, such as a liver function profile and hepatitis screening, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis."
