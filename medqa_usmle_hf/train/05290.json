The primary mechanism of heat loss in this scenario is evaporation, as sweat evaporation from the skin is the most effective way for the body to cool itself down in high temperatures. Conduction refers to heat transfer through direct contact with a cooler surface, convection refers to heat transfer through a fluid (such as air or water), and radiation refers to heat transfer through electromagnetic waves. While all of these mechanisms can contribute to heat loss or gain in different environments, evaporation is the most important in high-temperature and low-humidity conditions like those in the isolation chamber described."
