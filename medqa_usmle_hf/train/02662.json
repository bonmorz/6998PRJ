The patient is experiencing urinary retention, and among the options, only Prazosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker, can help in relieving the retention by relaxing the internal urethral sphincter. Neostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that helps in bladder emptying in certain conditions but not in this case. Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist, which will worsen the retention. Bethanechol is a cholinergic agonist that will stimulate bladder contraction but not help in the patient's case with the simultaneous contraction of the internal urethral sphincter."
