The patient's high glucose and high potassium levels are indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis, which is an emergency that requires immediate insulin and fluid therapy. Insulin promotes the uptake of glucose into cells, which will cause a decrease in serum glucose levels. Additionally, insulin promotes the uptake of potassium into cells, which will cause a decrease in serum potassium levels. The administration of insulin will also help to correct the acidosis, leading to an increase in pH and an increase in serum bicarbonate levels. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Decrease in serum potassium."

The patient is most likely experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis, which is characterized by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis (low pH and low HCO3) and elevated serum potassium levels. Treatment involves administration of insulin and IV fluids, which can lead to a decrease in serum potassium levels. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) decrease in serum potassium. The other options are incorrect because treatment is aimed at decreasing glucose levels and correcting the acidosis, which would lead to a decrease in serum glucose and increase in pH and serum bicarbonate levels."
