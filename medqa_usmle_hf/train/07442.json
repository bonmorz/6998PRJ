The patient presents with severe pain in his left shoulder, tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the left humerus, limited external rotation, and inability to slowly adduct his arm after it is passively abducted to 90 degrees. X-ray shows sclerosis of the acromion and humeral head, suggesting rotator cuff tear. Musculoskeletal ultrasound is the most appropriate next step in management as it can confirm the diagnosis of rotator cuff tear before considering surgical fixation. Reassurance is not appropriate here as the patient presents with severe pain and limited range of motion. Biopsy of the humerus is not necessary without more indications."
