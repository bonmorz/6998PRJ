Amenorrhea and dyspareunia suggest the possibility of menopause or premature ovarian failure, which is confirmed by the increased serum FSH levels. This is indicative of a decreased level of estradiol, which is confirmed by the decreased serum estradiol found in option C. The increased serum LH is due to the loss of feedback inhibition from estradiol. Options A and B are contradictory, and option D is unlikely as testosterone is not typically increased in menopause or premature ovarian failure."

Decreased serum progesterone and increased serum testosterone as in option (D) would indicate polycystic ovarian syndrome."
