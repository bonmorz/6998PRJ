The most appropriate measure of association in this scenario is the odds ratio (OR), which is calculated by cross-multiplying the two diagonal cells and dividing by the product of the two non-diagonal cells. In this case, (20 x 70) / (35 x 16) = 2.5, indicating that patients with a history of MDD have 2.5 times greater odds of experiencing unprovoked seizures compared to those without a history of MDD. Therefore, the answer is (C) 2.5."

This suggests that individuals with a history of MDD are 2.5 times more likely to experience unprovoked seizures after discharge from an inpatient psychiatric unit compared to those without MDD."
