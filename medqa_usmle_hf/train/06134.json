The patient's symptoms, including severe pain in multiple areas and laboratory values indicating hemolytic anemia and elevated LDH, suggest a diagnosis of microvascular occlusion, such as sickle cell crisis. Infarction of a major organ may have more specific symptoms based on the affected organ, and infection of the bone typically presents with localized pain and tenderness. Autoimmune hemolysis may cause similar laboratory findings, but typically presents with a more gradual onset of anemia and is less likely to cause widespread pain."

Infarction of a major organ would have more specific symptoms related to that organ, which are not described in the question. Infection of the bone (osteomyelitis) would have more localized tenderness and may be accompanied by fever, which are not described in the question. Autoimmune hemolysis may have similar laboratory values, but the patient's history of experiencing similar episodes before suggests a chronic condition such as sickle cell disease as the underlying cause."

The patient is presenting with severe pain in multiple parts of the body and has a low hemoglobin and hematocrit, which suggests anemia. The normal leukocyte count and absence of infection-related symptoms make infection of the bone unlikely. The normal liver function tests make infarction of a major organ unlikely. The elevated LDH suggests tissue damage, which can be caused by microvascular occlusion. Thus, the most likely diagnosis is microvascular occlusion, possible from sickle cell disease or another hemoglobinopathy."
