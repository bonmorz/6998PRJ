Heme synthesis occurs in the mitochondria of developing red blood cells, so blocking the first step will prevent the cells from producing heme. Since the cells in this experiment developed into normal erythrocytes except for the lack of heme, administering anti-Pb82 may remove the blockage and allow heme synthesis to occur. However, mature red blood cells do indeed lack mitochondria, so they would not be able to produce heme even if the blockage was removed. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) the cells will not produce heme since they lack mitochondria."

This is because erythrocytes do not contain organelles, including mitochondria, necessary for heme synthesis. Therefore, option (B) is correct.

Option (A) is incorrect since the cells were not able to produce heme even after the administration of anti-Pb82."

The lack of heme is unlikely related to cytosol or nucleoli, but rather the inability to synthesize it due to the initial treatment with Pb82. The statement that erythrocytes lack mitochondria is also true, but not relevant to the question of heme production. So, option (B) is the most likely correct answer."
