Option A is incorrect because increased apical ventilation would suggest a pneumothorax or other lung disease. Option B is unlikely because it suggests normal ventilation in the presence of symptoms. Option D is incorrect because decreased ventilation in only one lung would suggest an airway obstruction or other localized lung disease rather than a pulmonary embolism which would affect both lungs."

Option A is unlikely since apical ventilation is decreased in patients with congestive heart failure. Option B is unlikely since matched ventilation and perfusion is seen in normal lungs.
