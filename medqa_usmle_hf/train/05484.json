The patient has persistent vomiting, which is a common symptom of hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness. A beta hCG and pelvic ultrasound should be obtained to confirm diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of vomiting in pregnancy. This is the most important step in her management. While obtaining a basic electrolyte panel and admitting for intravenous rehydration may be necessary, it is not the next and most important step. Beginning treatment with vitamin B6 may also be helpful, but is not the most important step in this case."

Option D may be necessary if there is severe dehydration, but diagnosis and management should be established first."
