The patient's history of migratory pain and use of a medication for pain suggest a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, which is associated with increased lipoxygenase pathway activity. This increased activity can lead to inflammation and tissue damage, which could explain the sensation of a lump in her nose. Decreased lipoxygenase pathway activity would not likely be responsible for this complaint. Decreased prostaglandin activity and increased allergic reaction in mucosa are also unlikely to be related to the patient's complaint."
