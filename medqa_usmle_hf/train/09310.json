Exquisite left costovertebral angle tenderness is noted, which is a classic finding in patients with renal colic. Laboratory findings, including a urinalysis, are unremarkable, ruling out infection as a cause. The patient is already receiving IV fluid resuscitation, but the best next step in management is non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis to confirm the diagnosis of renal colic and assess for the size and location of the stone. This will guide further treatment, including pain management options. Admitting the patient for IV dilaudid patient-controlled analgesia or discharging with a prescription for dilaudid without further investigation is not appropriate and could lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment if the pain is caused by something other than renal colic. Administering ibuprofen and acetaminophen is not effective for severe pain associated with renal colic."

However, since he is experiencing acute-onset pain, the best next step in management would be a non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out any potential serious underlying causes such as obstruction or infection. Administration of pain control can still be initiated while waiting for imaging results. Therefore, options (A) and (B) can be considered but are not the best next step in management. Option (C) is inappropriate as the patient needs further evaluation and management, and the long-term use of opioids should be avoided, especially in patients with a history of nephrolithiasis."

The fact that he has a history of nephrolithiasis, the sharp severe pain, and the left costovertebral angle tenderness all suggest a kidney stone. The patient also states that he is allergic to many pain medications, but gets one that starts with D. The most commonly used medication for pain control in this situation is opioids, such as Dilaudid, which is likely the medication he is referring to. Admitting him to the hospital for IV pain control may be necessary, but the first step in management should be to confirm the diagnosis with a non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis. This will help determine the size and location of the stone and guide further management. Option B is not appropriate as ibuprofen can cause further damage to the kidney and acetaminophen may not provide adequate pain control. Option C is not appropriate as the patient needs immediate pain relief and close follow-up to monitor for potential complications."
