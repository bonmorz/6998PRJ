The Tdap vaccine could be a trigger for ITP. The most common cause of ITP in children is autoimmune destruction of platelets via IgG autoantibodies against platelet glycoproteins. Deficiency of ADAMTS13 is associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, not ITP, while deposition of IgA immune complexes is associated with IgA nephropathy. Systemic activation of clotting cascade resulting in platelet and coagulation factor consumption is seen in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but the presentation is usually different from ITP."

In ITP, the body mistakenly produces IgG antibodies against platelet glycoproteins, leading to platelet destruction by macrophages in the spleen and liver. This results in low platelet counts and bleeding tendencies. Deficiency of ADAMTS13 is seen in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), whereas deposition of IgA immune complexes is seen in IgA nephropathy. Systemic activation of the clotting cascade leading to platelet and coagulation factor consumption is seen in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but this patient's presentation and laboratory findings are not consistent with DIC."
