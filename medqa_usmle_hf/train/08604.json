The patient has a very flexible body and long fingers, which are characteristic of Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by a fibrillin defect. The mid-systolic click over the apex is a characteristic finding of mitral valve prolapse, which can be seen in Marfan syndrome due to the weakened connective tissue leading to myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve. Therefore, the most likely mechanism behind this finding is a fibrillin defect. Group A streptococcal pharyngitis is not related to this finding. Root dilatation and collagen defect are associated with other connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome."

Option (B) is incorrect as group A streptococcal pharyngitis does not cause Marfan syndrome.

Option (D) is partially correct as Marfan syndrome is indeed caused by a defect in the connective tissue protein, but specifically, that protein is fibrillin."
