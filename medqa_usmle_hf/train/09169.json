The patient has symptoms of liver dysfunction, including dark urine, low-grade fever, fatigue, and pale appearing stools. The physical examination shows a palpable liver and spleen, as well as telangiectasias on the anterior thorax. The liver function tests show elevated AST, direct bilirubin, and globulins, as well as a positive anti-smooth muscle antibody test. These findings are characteristic of autoimmune hepatitis, making it the most likely cause. Primary biliary cholangitis would show elevated ALP, and primary sclerosing cholangitis would show a dilated bile duct on imaging. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can cause liver disease, but it typically presents in childhood or early adulthood, and the liver function tests would be more severely abnormal."
