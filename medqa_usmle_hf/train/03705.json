The soft and boggy uterus on palpation suggests this is the cause. Administration of oxytocin did not stop the bleeding, so the next step should be to administer tranexamic acid, which can help to reduce bleeding. Hysterectomy is not necessary at this stage, and blood transfusion should only be considered if there is significant blood loss. Carboprost tromethamine can also be used but is typically reserved for cases where other measures have failed."

Among the options, administering tranexamic acid is the most appropriate first step, as it helps to stabilize fibrin clots and reduce bleeding. Hysterectomy is a more invasive and extreme option and should only be considered if other interventions fail. Blood transfusion may be required if the patient becomes anemic, but it does not directly address the cause of the bleeding. Carboprost tromethamine can be used as a second-line agent, but tranexamic acid is the initial preferred treatment."

Administering carboprost tromethamine, a medication that helps contract the uterus, is another option but should only be considered if other measures fail. Blood transfusion may be necessary if the patient's hemoglobin drops too low, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management."

The patient is experiencing postpartum hemorrhage, as evidenced by heavy vaginal bleeding and an enlarged uterus that fails to respond to standard measures.

Performing a hysterectomy may be necessary if all other methods fail, but it is a major surgical procedure with significant risks. Administering carboprost tromethamine or transfusing blood may also be necessary, but tranexamic acid is the most appropriate first-line treatment for postpartum hemorrhage."
