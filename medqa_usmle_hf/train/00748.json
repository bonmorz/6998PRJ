The biopsy images show inflammation and ulceration in the rectum and sigmoid colon, suggesting that the disease is likely to begin continuously in the rectum (option B). P-ANCA positive and family history suggest ulcerative colitis, which typically involves the rectum and extends proximally. Perianal disease (option A) and fistulae and stricture formation (option C) are more commonly associated with Crohn's disease, while cobblestoning and skip lesions (option D) are also more commonly seen in Crohn's disease."
