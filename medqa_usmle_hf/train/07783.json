The symptoms suggest that the most likely cause of the edema is lymphatic obstruction, such as from lymph node resection during the low anterior resection. Lipid-rich, protein-rich fluid is called lymph and is the fluid that accumulates in lymphedema. Acellular, protein-poor fluid is unlikely as this would suggest a transudative, rather than exudative, process. Lymphocytic, hemosiderin-rich fluid may suggest chronic venous insufficiency, but this patient has no signs of venous distention or varicose veins. Protein-rich, glycosaminoglycan-rich fluid is unlikely as this would suggest a diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis, which is not consistent with this patient's history."
