The presence of restricted joint movement and coarse facial features strongly suggest MPS. Among the options, only Mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) is involved in MPS. M6P is a lysosomal enzyme that helps target the enzyme to the lysosome. Deficiency in M6P causes the enzyme to be secreted rather than targeted to the lysosome, leading to accumulation of lysosomal enzymes in the blood."
