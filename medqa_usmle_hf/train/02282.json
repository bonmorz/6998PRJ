Candida albicans is not typically considered a cause of UTIs, but rather a cause of vaginal yeast infections, so it is not relevant to this question. Therefore, the option that would not classify a UTI as complicated is (A) The causative organism is Candida albicans."

A complicated UTI is defined as a UTI that occurs in a patient with underlying conditions that increase the risk of acquiring infection or that hinder successful therapy.

Candida albicans is not a typical UTI-causing organism, but if it is the only organism isolated and the patient is otherwise healthy, it is not considered a complicated UTI. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of complicated UTIs, particularly in patients with underlying conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) The causative organism is Candida albicans."
