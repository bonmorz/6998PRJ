The enzyme deficiency responsible for 46, XX CAH is 21-hydroxylase, which is responsible for converting progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone to cortisol. Therefore, none of the options directly involve 21-hydroxylase and are incorrect. However, 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone involves steroid hormones and is the closest option, making it the correct answer."

The symptoms and serum studies suggest congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and the karyotype confirms it to be 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the most common form of CAH. This enzyme is responsible for converting 17-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone, and then to corticosterone. Option (B) is the correct answer, as corticosterone deficiency leads to salt wasting and hypertension, which are seen in this patient. Progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone is catalyzed by 21-hydroxylase, but it is not the correct option as progesterone is not present in the serum studies. Testosterone to dihydrotestosterone is a different pathway that is not related to adrenal hormones. Progesterone to 17-hydroxyprogesterone is the initial step in the pathway, which is deficient in 21-hydroxylase deficiency, but it is not the cause of hypertension and salt wasting seen in this patient."

Female infants with CAH are most commonly deficient in 21-hydroxylase enzyme which converts progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone, leading to salt-wasting and virilization. However, this patient's karyotype is XX, ruling out 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The next most common type of CAH in females is congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, which converts 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone. This deficiency can cause hypertension, virilization, and hypokalemia, matching the patient's presentation."

The presentation of clitoral enlargement, labioscrotal fusion, elevated blood pressure, and low levels of potassium suggest congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). CAH is most commonly caused by a deficiency of 21-hydroxylase or 11-beta-hydroxylase, enzymes responsible for converting 17-hydroxyprogesterone to cortisol or 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone, respectively. In this case, the karyotype is normal female (46,XX), ruling out 5-alpha-reductase deficiency as a cause of the genital anomalies, and the low potassium level favors 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency over 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Therefore, the correct answer is (B), which refers to the enzyme responsible for the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone."
