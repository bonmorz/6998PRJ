The symptoms, including numbness, weakness, and absence of deep tendon reflexes, suggest decreased neuronal excitability.

Autoantibody-mediated destruction of Ca2+ channels in the nerve endings at the neuromuscular junction leads to Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which presents with weakness and diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes."
