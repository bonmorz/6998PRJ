Ventilation-perfusion scan would not be indicated in this patient as she does not have any symptoms or findings suggestive of pulmonary embolism.

The most appropriate next step in management would be reassurance and monitoring, as these symptoms are expected in pregnancy and do not necessarily indicate any complications. Urinalysis may be helpful in ruling out preeclampsia, but the absence of hypertension makes this less likely. A lower extremity Doppler or ventilation-perfusion scan would not be indicated based on the patient's presentation."
