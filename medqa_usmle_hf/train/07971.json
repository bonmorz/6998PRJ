The symptoms suggest a central cord syndrome, which is often caused by spinal cord injury from a traumatic event like a fall. The sensory loss in the upper limbs is consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoker\u2019s history may have also contributed to the development of this syndrome. Anterior cord syndrome would result in motor paralysis and loss of pain and temperature sensation, while Guillain-Barre syndrome affects the peripheral nervous system and would not cause these specific sensory deficits. Pontine infarction would present with more widespread symptoms, such as decreased consciousness or cranial nerve deficits."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a spinal cord injury, with reduced perception of sharp stimuli and temperature in the upper limbs, but normal strength in all limbs.

Anterior cord syndrome usually involves a loss of motor function as well, while Guillain-Barre syndrome typically starts with weakness in the lower limbs and moves upward. Pontine infarction would not present with these symptoms. "
