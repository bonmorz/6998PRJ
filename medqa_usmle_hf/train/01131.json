Since the patient is presenting with symptoms of type 2 diabetes, we can assume that she has low insulin secretion and/or resistance. Therefore, the drug that would most significantly increase C-peptide levels, which is a marker of insulin secretion, would be a sulfonylurea like glipizide. Insulin itself would also increase C-peptide levels but may not be the best choice for this patient. Acarbose slows down carbohydrate breakdown and may not directly increase insulin secretion. NPH is an intermediate-acting insulin and would not increase C-peptide levels."
