The symptoms, history of diabetes mellitus, and CT scan suggest that the underlying pathology is located in the psoas major muscle. Option A (quadratus lumborum muscle) does not extend down as far as the left groin, and option B (iliacus muscle) does not extend up as high as the level of the kidney. The symptoms and CT scan suggest that the pathology is not located in the left kidney itself but rather in the surrounding tissue."

The image shows swelling and inflammation of the psoas muscle, indicating that the underlying pathology is most likely located in the psoas major muscle. Diabetes mellitus can increase the risk of psoas abscess. Examination findings, including tenderness along the left flank and painful passive extension of the left hip, are also consistent with psoas involvement. The other options are muscles or organs that are adjacent to the psoas muscle but not directly involved in this case."
