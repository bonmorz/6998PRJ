The photograph and the patient history suggest that the most likely cause is keloid, which is an abnormal response to increased production of hyalinized collagen. Implantation of epidermis into the dermis can cause a cyst or a foreign body reaction. Malignant transformation of keratinocytes can lead to squamous cell carcinoma, but this is unlikely in this case. Excess formation of organized extracellular matrix can cause a fibroma or a desmoid tumor, but these are also unlikely given the presentation."

Implantation of epidermis into the dermis occurs in epidermal inclusion cysts, malignant transformation of keratinocytes occurs in squamous cell carcinoma, and excess formation of organized extracellular matrix occurs in keloids."

This is consistent with a keloid, which is an abnormal overgrowth of scar tissue. Keloids are caused by increased production of hyalinized collagen. Implantation of epidermis into the dermis can cause epidermoid cysts, but they do not typically appear after ear piercing. Malignant transformation of keratinocytes is a possible complication of prolonged sun exposure and can result in squamous cell carcinoma. Excess formation of organized extracellular matrix is seen in fibrosis, but this is not the case in this patient's condition."
