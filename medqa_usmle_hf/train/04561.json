The location and nature of the pain, as well as the rebound tenderness and negative psoas sign, suggest acute appendicitis. The right splanchnic nerve transmits pain from the appendix region. Somatic afferent nerve fibers are responsible for pain from the abdominal wall, not the visceral organs, so options B and C can be ruled out. The pelvic nerves are not involved in transmitting pain from the appendix region."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, along with the location of the pain and tenderness, suggest that the most likely diagnosis is acute appendicitis. The right splanchnic nerve is responsible for carrying visceral pain from the appendix to the spinal cord. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Somatic afferent nerve fibers carry pain signals from the skin and muscles of the abdomen, but they are not responsible for visceral pain from the appendix. The pelvic nerves do not transmit pain from the appendix either."
