The significance level is set at 10%, meaning alpha (the probability of a type 1 error) is 0.10. Using a z-test, we calculate the z-score for a height of 68.5 inches (the lower range of the expected heights for the polluted community). This comes out to be -2.83. Using a z-table, we find the corresponding probability to be 0.00226. This is less than alpha, so we reject the null hypothesis that the heights in the polluted community are not significantly different from the national average. Therefore, our power is non-zero and we can conclude that the proposed study has a power of 1 - 0.15 = 0.85."

This corresponds to a z-score of -1.28 (found using a z-table or calculator). Setting the null hypothesis mean equal to 69 inches and the alternative hypothesis mean equal to the expected mean height in the polluted town, we can calculate the value of the test statistic for a population mean equal to the alternative hypothesis mean: \n\nz = (sample mean - population mean) / (population standard deviation / sqrt(sample size)) \nz = (x\u0304 - 68.5) / (0.1/sqrt(30))\nz = (x\u0304 - 68.5) / 0.0183\n\nwhere x\u0304 is the expected sample mean in the polluted town. \n\nTo find the power of the test, we need to assume a specific alternative hypothesis mean and then calculate the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e., finding a significant difference) if that alternative hypothesis mean is true. We'll assume that the alternative hypothesis mean is 68.8 inches (i.e., a difference of 0.2 inches from the national average). \n\nSo, we want to find the probability of getting a z-score less than -1.28 (the critical value) when the population mean is 68.8 inches and the standard deviation is still 0.1 inches: \n\nz = (x\u0304 - 68.8) / (0.1/sqrt(30))\nz = (x\u0304 - 68.8) / 0.0183\n\nP(z < -1.28 | \u03bc = 68.8) = P(z < (x\u0304 - 68.8) / 0.0183) \n\nWe know that the probability of a type 2 error (i.e., failing to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true) is 15%, which means that the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e., having power) is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 0.85."

We also need to calculate the critical value for a one-tailed z-test with a 10% significance level, which is 1.28. Using the formula for the standard error of the mean, we find that the standard error for this sample is 0.0183. To calculate the z-score for the sample mean, we use the formula z = (x\u0304 - \u03bc) / (\u03c3 / \u221an), where x\u0304 is the sample mean, \u03bc is the population mean (69 inches), \u03c3 is the population standard deviation (0.1 inches), and n is the sample size (30). With a sample mean of 68.5 inches, we get a z-score of -2.59. Since this is less than the critical value of -1.28, we reject the null hypothesis that the population mean height is 69 inches and conclude that the heights in this town are significantly lower than the national average. To calculate power, we need to find the z-score that corresponds to a 15% probability of a type 2 error. Using a z-table, we find this to be 1.04. We can then use this z-score to find the corresponding sample mean that would fail to reject the null hypothesis. We get x\u0304 = \u03bc + (z * \u03c3 / \u221an) = 69 + (1.04 * 0.1 / \u221a30) = 69.055 inches. The difference between this sample mean and the true population mean is called the effect size, which is (68.5 - 69.055) / 0.0183 = -30.1. To calculate power, we use a z-table to find the probability of getting a z-score of -2.59 or lower, given an effect size of -30.1. This probability is approximately 0.85, so the power of the study is 0.85. Therefore, the correct answer is (A)."
