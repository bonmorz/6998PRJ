The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a neurological disorder and the MRI scan shows hyperintense round lesions in the frontal and temporal lobe at the border of the gray and white matter, which is suggestive of cerebral metastasis. Among the options, lung cancer is the most common cause of cerebral metastasis. Glioblastoma multiforme presents with rapid onset of symptoms and a single enhancing mass on imaging. Multiple sclerosis presents with symptoms that come and go, and can have a variety of locations and shapes of brain lesions. Colorectal cancer is not a common cause of cerebral metastasis."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a neurological disorder and the MRI scan shows lesions in the frontal and temporal lobe, which is consistent with the diagnosis of brain metastases. Lung cancer is the most common source of brain metastases, making it the most likely diagnosis among the options. Glioblastoma multiforme is a type of brain cancer, but it usually presents with rapid progression of symptoms over weeks, rather than months. Multiple sclerosis does have lesions on MRI but they are typically located in the white matter and the presentation of symptoms is different. Colorectal cancer is not usually associated with brain metastases."
