The patient\u2019s symptoms and family history suggest the possibility of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, which is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of tumors and cysts in various organs. VHL is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and a mutation in the VHL gene, located on chromosome 3, is responsible for the disease. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 3."
