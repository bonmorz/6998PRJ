The patient\u2019s history of no menarche and recent onset of headaches suggests the possibility of an underlying medical condition such as a brain tumor in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Pelvic ultrasound can help evaluate for any congenital or structural issues with the reproductive system that may be causing the delayed onset of menarche. MRI of the head may be necessary if the ultrasound is negative or if there is suspicion for an intracranial lesion. Serum estradiol and testosterone levels may be useful in evaluating for hormonal imbalances, but pelvic ultrasound is the best initial step in management given the patient\u2019s presenting symptoms."

The pulsating headache occurring on one side with nausea relieved by ibuprofen suggests migraine. The elevated blood pressure suggests an underlying condition. A pelvic ultrasound is the best next step in management to evaluate for any anatomical abnormalities that may be causing the primary amenorrhea. MRI of the head would be indicated if there were neurologic findings present or if the headache was not typical of migraine. Serum estradiol and testosterone levels may be useful in further evaluating the underlying cause of amenorrhea but would not be the immediate next step."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest that she may have migraine headaches, but since she has not experienced menarche, it's important to rule out potential underlying gynecological issues. Therefore, a pelvic ultrasound is the best next step in management to assess for any potential gynecological abnormalities or causes for her delayed menarche. An MRI of the head may be considered if there are concerns of neurological or intracranial pathology. Serum estradiol and testosterone would not be the best initial tests in this situation."
