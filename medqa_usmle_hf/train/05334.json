For patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension, the first-line therapy is an ACE inhibitor, such as lisinopril. Hydrochlorothiazide is also a common first-line therapy for hypertension, but in patients with diabetes, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are preferred due to their potential to delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Prazosin is an alpha-blocker and is not typically used as a first-line therapy for hypertension. Isoproterenol is a beta-agonist and would worsen the patient's hypertension, and is not used for hypertension treatment."
