The symptoms suggest a feeding problem due to respiratory distress, which can be caused by patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The precordial murmur heard is also consistent with PDA, as it is loudest at S2 and radiates to the left clavicle. A congenital mitral insufficiency or supracristal ventricular septal defect with aortic regurgitation would have different murmurs, while ruptured congenital sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is rare and usually presents in adulthood."

The symptoms and signs are suggestive of patent ductus arteriosus, which includes feeding difficulty, rapid breathing, sweating while feeding, poor weight gain, and a continuous murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border. Congenital mitral insufficiency will have a systolic murmur best heard at the apex. The second sound is obscured in both patent ductus arteriosus and supracristal ventricular septal defect with aortic regurgitation, but the latter will have a harsh ejection systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border. Ruptured congenital sinus of Valsalva aneurysm can cause heart failure, but it is uncommon in infants."

The symptoms and signs suggest a congenital heart disease, and among the options, the best fit is patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).

Other options have different types of murmurs or do not fit the symptoms and signs."

The bilateral wheezing on chest auscultation indicates a respiratory problem, while the precordial murmur and location suggest a cardiac problem. The most likely cause is patent ductus arteriosus, which is characterized by a continuous machinery-like murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border or the lower left cervical region. It may be asymptomatic or may present with feeding difficulty or failure to thrive, rapid breathing, sweating, and fatigue. The first heart sound (S1) is normal, while the second heart sound (S2) is obscured by the murmur, which is consistent with patent ductus arteriosus."
