Transference is the redirection of a patient's feelings and desires or the transfer of a patient\u2019s unconscious conflict to the therapist. In this case, the patient\u2019s comment about having the courage to ask is likely a projection of her own feelings onto the therapist, which is a form of transference. Displacement is the redirection of emotions from one person or object to another, Passive aggression is an indirect expression of hostility, and Reaction formation is the expression of the opposite of one's feelings."

In this case, the patient's behavior towards the therapist is likely a result of her unresolved feelings towards her ex-husband and is an example of transference.

Transference is when a patient has unresolved feelings or issues from a past relationship that they transfer onto the therapist or someone in their current life. In this case, the patient may be transferring her anger towards her ex-husband onto the therapist, and expressing her frustration with his behavior. Displacement is when someone takes out their emotions on a substitute rather than the actual target. Passive aggression is when someone expresses their anger indirectly, such as through sarcasm or ignoring someone. Reaction formation is when someone expresses the opposite of their true feelings as a way to cope with their discomfort.
