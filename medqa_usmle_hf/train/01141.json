The ability of cancer cells to invade and migrate away from the original site of insertion suggests that the cells are capable of metastasis. Among the options, only the release of matrix metalloproteinase is directly linked to the process of metastasis. Matrix metalloproteinase enzymes break down extracellular matrix components, allowing cancer cells to move into adjacent tissues and eventually spread to distant sites.
