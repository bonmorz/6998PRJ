During a period of prolonged fasting, the body converts stored fats into ketones, including acetoacetate, which can be used by the brain as an alternative fuel source. Amino acids and cholesterol are not directly used for energy production, and free fatty acids are converted into ketones which are then used as an energy source. Therefore, acetoacetate is mostly responsible for supplying the brain with energy in this scenario."
