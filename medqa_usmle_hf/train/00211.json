The location of the bleeding, in the posterior nasal cavity, indicates that the bleeding is most likely from the sphenopalatine artery, a branch of the maxillary artery. Ligation of the maxillary artery can help to control the bleeding. Anterior cerebral artery supplies the frontal lobe of the brain and ligation of this artery would not help control nasal bleeding. The facial artery supplies the face and neck and the occipital artery supplies muscles and skin over the occipital bone, neither of which is involved in this case."
