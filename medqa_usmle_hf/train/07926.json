Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized by an increased thickness of the heart muscle, making it harder for the heart to pump blood. Nitrates can worsen the problem by causing vasodilation, which can lead to a decrease in blood pressure and increased strain on the heart. Beta-blockers, potassium channel blockers, and dobutamine are all used to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but nitrates are contraindicated."
