The accumulation of alanine and pyruvate, as well as the metabolic acidosis with increased anion gap, suggests a defect in pyruvate metabolism. Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is the most likely cause, as it is a genetic disorder that can present with seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delay, as well as elevated lactate and alanine levels. Alanine transaminase is not involved in pyruvate metabolism, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is involved in glucose metabolism, and pyruvate kinase is involved in glycolysis, but not in pyruvate metabolism."
