The symptoms and lab work suggest polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is characterized by irregular periods, acne, and weight gain.

Metformin is an alternative, but it is not the initial medication to treat PCOS. Spironolactone is used for acne and hirsutism, but it does not regulate menstrual cycles.
