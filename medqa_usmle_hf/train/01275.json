The image shows plexiform lesion, which is a characteristic pathological finding in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) associated with BMPR2 gene mutation. PAH is characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance, which can be treated with vasodilators such as prostacyclin analogs, endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Therefore, the most likely pharmacologic therapy that the physician will provide is a vasodilator. Plasmapheresis, inhibitor of nitric oxide, and bronchodilator are not effective treatments for PAH."
