Lobectomy or pneumonectomy are not preferred treatment options because the cancer has already spread to the lymph nodes.

However, removal of the entire lung (pneumonectomy) is not recommended due to the patient\u2019s good performance status. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Option B involves pneumonectomy with adjuvant therapy, which may be too aggressive for this patient. Options C and D involve platinum-based chemotherapy and thoracic radiation therapy, which are standard treatments for limited-disease small cell lung cancer. However, option C is favored over option D, as etoposide is more effective in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy than topotecan. Therefore, the best treatment option for this patient is platinum-based chemotherapy plus etoposide and thoracic radiation therapy (option C)."
