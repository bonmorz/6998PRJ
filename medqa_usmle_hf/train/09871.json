The patient\u2019s lab results suggest megaloblastic anemia, often caused by a deficiency in Vitamin B12 or folic acid. Intrinsic factor, which is produced in the stomach, is necessary for the absorption of Vitamin B12. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies suggest an autoimmune cause. Pernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune condition that attacks the cells in the stomach that produce intrinsic factor, can cause megaloblastic anemia. Since Vitamin B12 is necessary for proper thyroid function, a patient with pernicious anemia may also have high serum TSH levels. Therefore, the answer is (A). Cheilosis may also be present due to Vitamin B12 deficiency. Psoriasis and abdominal colic are not typically associated with pernicious anemia."

The low hemoglobin, hematocrit, and MCV, along with macrocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils, suggest a megaloblastic anemia which is commonly caused by a deficiency in vitamin B12. An autoimmune condition with anti-intrinsic factor antibodies may cause such a deficiency. Vitamin B12 is essential for thyroid function; therefore, a high serum TSH may be expected in this patient. Cheilosis (cracks and/or scaling at the corner of the mouth) is another common symptom of vitamin B12 deficiency.
