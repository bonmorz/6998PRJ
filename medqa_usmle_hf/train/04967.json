Ultrasound examination may be helpful but is not the initial step. Examination of the fundus may be difficult due to the vitreous hemorrhage, and placing an ocular pad may worsen the hyphema."

Ultrasound examination of the left eye may be helpful in assessing the extent of the injury, but is not the first step in management. Examination of the fundus with a tropicamide application may also be necessary, but should be done by an ophthalmologist. Placing an ocular pad onto the affected eye may be helpful in reducing pain and light sensitivity, but should not be used as the first step in management."

Ultrasound examination is a good option for further diagnosis. However, given the potential risk of infection from the ocular injuries, systemic administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is important to prevent complications of endophthalmitis. Placing an ocular pad onto the affected eye may cause additional trauma to the eye, so it\u2019s not recommended. Examination of the fundus with a tropicamide application may be useful, but not as urgent as systemic administration of antibiotics."

Proper management includes systemic administration of antibiotics to prevent infection, so option (D) is the correct answer. Option (A) might be considered to evaluate the extent of injury, but it is not the first step in management. Option (B) may be considered later after initial management, but it is not as urgent as administering antibiotics. Option (C) is contraindicated as the patient has a hyphema that could be worsened by ocular compression."

The presence of conjunctival hyperemia, peaked pupil, iridial asymmetry, hyphema, and vitreous hemorrhage suggests that the patient has intraocular bleeding and possibly a ruptured globe. Topical application of tropicamide for fundus examination and ocular pad placement can worsen the bleeding and aggravate the condition. Ultrasound examination can be useful in ruling out retinal detachment but is not the first step in acute management. Systemic administration of antibiotics is recommended to cover for possible infection resulting from the open wound. Vancomycin and levofloxacin provide broad-spectrum coverage for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria."
