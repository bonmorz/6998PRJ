The hormone described in the scenario is melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which stimulates pigmentation of the skin. MSH is often cosecreted with corticotropin (ACTH) from the pituitary gland, which acts on mu receptors in the adrenal gland to stimulate the synthesis and release of cortisol. Therefore, the answer is (C) Mu receptor."
