The patient is presenting with difficulty walking and cold feet along with absent pedal pulses, which suggests reduced blood flow to the legs. This indicates low tissue oxygenation in the legs. A grade 2/6 systolic murmur in the left paravertebral region indicates aortic coarctation, which can cause interarm difference in blood pressure and rib notching. However, reduced blood flow to the legs is the most likely finding. Right ventricular outflow obstruction is less likely as it would typically present with cyanosis and clubbing of the fingers."

Rib notching is associated with coarctation of the aorta but it presents with high blood pressure also. Interarm difference in blood pressure is associated with aortic dissection but the patient has no other symptoms indicating that. Right ventricular outflow obstruction is associated with pulmonary stenosis, but the patient\u2019s symptoms and absent pedal pulses point towards peripheral vascular disease rather than pulmonary stenosis."
