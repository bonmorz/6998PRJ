The symptoms suggest a possible fishbone impaction in the esophagus, which can lead to complications such as esophageal perforation.

The acute onset of dysphagia, odynophagia, and bloody sputum suggest esophageal perforation or obstruction, likely caused by fish bone ingestion.

Emergency endoscopy is the best intervention to visualize and remove the obstruction or foreign body. IV administration of glucagon is used for esophageal smooth muscle relaxation but is not the primary intervention in this case.
