Transfusions increase the iron level in the body and lead to iron deposition in various organs, causing tissue damage. The symptoms suggest iron overload and hemolysis, which causes decreased haptoglobin. Elevated hepcidin levels regulate iron metabolism and decreased transferrin saturation is a sign of iron deficiency; neither are likely in this case. Elevated ferritin indicates increased iron storage in the body, which is consistent with the patient's history of beta-thalassemia major and transfusions."

Beta-thalassemia major is a hereditary blood disorder that causes a decrease in the production of hemoglobin, which can lead to anemia. Patients with beta-thalassemia major require frequent blood transfusions, which can cause iron overload in the body. Elevated ferritin is a marker for iron overload and can explain the hyperpigmented skin, scleral icterus, and liver span enlargement. Hepcidin is a hormone involved in regulating iron metabolism and would be expected to be decreased in this patient. Transferrin saturation is a measure of the amount of iron bound to transferrin and would be expected to be increased in this patient due to iron overload.
