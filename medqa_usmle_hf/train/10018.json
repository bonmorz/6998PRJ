The process of converting mRNA to cDNA is called reverse transcription, and is carried out by the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Among the options, only enveloped, diploid (+) ssRNA viruses such as retroviruses (e.g. HIV) have reverse transcriptase as one of their enzymes. Nonenveloped, (+) ssRNA viruses (e.g. picornaviruses) do not have this enzyme. Enveloped, circular (-) ssRNA viruses (e.g. influenza) have RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is not used in reverse transcription. Nonenveloped, ssDNA viruses (e.g. Parvoviruses) likewise do not have reverse transcriptase. Thus, the answer is (D)."
