The laboratory findings suggest a possible diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which is confirmed by bone marrow biopsy. Cytogenetic studies, such as a karyotype analysis or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), can confirm the diagnosis and also determine the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome or other chromosomal abnormalities that may guide treatment. Cytarabine and daunorubicin are chemotherapy agents used for acute myeloid leukemia, which is less likely given the chronic nature of the symptoms. Serum protein electrophoresis is used to diagnose multiple myeloma, but the laboratory findings do not suggest this diagnosis. All-trans retinoic acid is used for acute promyelocytic leukemia, which is not suggested by the laboratory findings."
