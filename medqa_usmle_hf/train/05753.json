The sudden onset of blindness with no other neurological deficits, normal MRI views except for the suprasellar cistern, and recent emotional stress suggest a diagnosis of conversion disorder. Acute ischemic stroke is unlikely given the lack of other neurological deficits and normal MRI views other than the suprasellar cistern. Pituitary adenoma is another possibility but would require more imaging studies and laboratory studies to confirm. Malingering is unlikely given the patient's calm demeanor."

Conversion disorder is a psychiatric disorder in which psychological stress leads to physical symptoms such as blindness or paralysis. The patient\u2019s recent break up may have triggered this disorder. Malingering, on the other hand, refers to the deliberate faking or exaggeration of symptoms for personal gain, which is not likely in this case as the patient appears calm and there is no apparent gain."

Moreover, the patient\u2019s calm demeanor is not typical of someone with acute ischemic stroke. Pituitary adenoma presents with symptoms of hormone excess or deficiency. Malingering is purposeful falsification or gross exaggeration of symptoms for external gain. Conversion disorder is a neurologic disorder characterized by symptoms or deficits that cannot be explained by a medical condition and are instead due to the patient\u2019s psychological conflict or need. Given the patient\u2019s recent breakup, the sudden onset of blindness is more likely to be a somatic symptom of a conversion disorder, rather than a true physical problem."
