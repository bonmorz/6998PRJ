The recurrent bacterial infections and undetectable serum levels of immunoglobulins suggest an X-linked recessive disorder affecting B-cell development and is most likely to be Bruton agammaglobulinemia. Common variable immunodeficiency is a primary immunodeficiency typically affecting adults with normal B-cell differentiation. DiGeorge syndrome is caused by a developmental defect in the thymus and parathyroid glands, and does not typically present with decreased immunoglobulin levels. Hereditary angioedema is caused by a deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor and does not typically present with recurrent bacterial infections."
