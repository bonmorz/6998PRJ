The MRI shows periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), which is often seen in premature infants with hypoxic-ischemic injury or in term infants with infection or hypotension. The history of febrile illness and myalgia during pregnancy suggests maternal rubella infection. Rubella causes congenital rubella syndrome which can lead to a host of clinical findings such as cataracts, glaucoma, cardiac defects, and hearing loss. However, the most likely finding associated with PVL is spasticity of the bilateral lower extremities. Therefore, answer choice (B) is the correct response."
