Bipolar disorder is often treated with mood stabilizers, and many of these medications require therapeutic monitoring, including lithium which is commonly used for bipolar disorder. Thyroid function impairment is a potential side effect of some mood stabilizers, so the patient should be informed about this risk. Medications for bipolar disorder should not be discontinued abruptly without medical supervision, and if the prescribed therapy fails, switching to another therapy may be necessary.

The patient has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and is likely being prescribed a mood stabilizer such as lithium or valproic acid. Both of these medications require therapeutic monitoring, particularly of thyroid function. Abrupt discontinuation of these medications can lead to a recurrence of symptoms, so the patient should be tapered off slowly if the medication is no longer needed. If this therapy fails, the patient can be switched to other medications under the guidance of a physician. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."
