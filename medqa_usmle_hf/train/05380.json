Resistance to insulin-mediated glucose uptake and autoantibodies to pancreatic beta cells can lead to diabetes with increased risk of complications. Mutation in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 can cause a rare form of diabetes that is usually diagnosed at a younger age with a family history of diabetes."
