The skin lesions on the palms are Janeway lesions, which are caused by septic emboli, commonly seen in patients with infective endocarditis, which can be caused by mitral valve prolapse. Rheumatic heart disease can also cause mitral valve disease, but there is no history of streptococcal infection. Systemic lupus erythematosus can cause various systemic manifestations, but it is not typically associated with mitral valve disease.
