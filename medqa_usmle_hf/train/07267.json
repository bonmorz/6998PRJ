Among the options, tuberculosis is the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms because he immigrated from Indonesia, works in a shipyard, has a cough and shortness of breath, and chest x-ray shows bilateral pleural effusion and patchy infiltrates. Viral myocarditis is unlikely because the patient had an anterior myocardial infarction 3 years ago. Amyloidosis is unlikely because proteinuria is only 1+. Asbestos is unlikely because there is no history of occupational exposure to asbestos mentioned."

Viral myocarditis does not explain the pleural effusion and hepatomegaly, and asbestos exposure would require further occupational history and imaging studies."
