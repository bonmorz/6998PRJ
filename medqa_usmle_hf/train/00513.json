The decrease in blood flow to the transplanted liver and the high liver function test results suggest ischemic cholangiopathy. The histological feature of interstitial cellular infiltration with parenchymal fibrosis and obliterative arteritis may be seen in ischemic cholangiopathy. Normal architecture of bile ducts and hepatocytes (A) would not explain the high bilirubin levels and liver function test results. Broad fibrous septations with formation of micronodules (B) would suggest cirrhosis, which would not be expected in a patient who underwent liver transplantation 7 years ago. Ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes (C) may be seen in hepatitis, but the clinical scenario and laboratory findings suggest ischemic cholangiopathy."
