Hemolytic transfusion reactions are caused by type 2 hypersensitivity reactions, in which antibodies bind to antigens on transfused cells and activate complement, leading to hemolysis and subsequent symptoms such as fever, chills, and hematuria. Pulmonary edema and shock are more severe manifestations of this reaction. Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions involve IgE antibodies and are associated with allergy symptoms such as hives and anaphylaxis. Type 3 hypersensitivity reactions are associated with immune complex deposition and inflammation, while type 4 hypersensitivity reactions are delayed hypersensitivity reactions involving T cells."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a transfusion reaction, and the fact that he received 6 units of O negative blood suggests a type 2 hypersensitivity reaction. This occurs when the recipient\u2019s immune system reacts against donor cells, leading to complement activation, antibody-mediated cell lysis, and release of cytokines. Symptoms may include fever, chills, hematuria, pulmonary edema, and hemodynamic shock. Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction involves IgE-mediated release of histamine and is associated with allergies. Type 3 hypersensitivity reaction involves immune complex deposition and complement activation, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. Type 4 hypersensitivity reaction involves T cell-mediated response and delayed-type hypersensitivity, seen in conditions such as contact dermatitis and TB skin testing."

The transfused whole blood, particularly the red blood cells, may have contained antigens the patient\u2019s immune system perceived as foreign and targeted with antibodies, leading to hemolysis and subsequent complications. Type 1 reactions are immediate hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, which typically occur within minutes to hours of exposure to an allergen. Type 3 reactions involve immune complex formation and deposition, causing inflammation and tissue damage.
