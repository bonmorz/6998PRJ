The symptoms suggest a progressive motor neuron disease, and among the options, only Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis matches the symptoms. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome usually starts with numbness and tingling in the limbs, and Myasthenia gravis usually presents with fluctuating muscle weakness that worsens with activity. Spinal muscular atrophy typically presents in infancy. The presence of pooling of oral secretions suggests bulbar involvement in ALS. The differential diagnosis also includes other motor neuron diseases such as primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance, but the given symptoms match ALS the most."

Progressive weakness in arms and legs is a key feature of ALS, as well as difficulty swallowing and holding the head up. Deep tendon reflexes are reduced in the upper extremities and increased in the lower extremities, which is typical of ALS. Sensation to light touch, pinprick, and vibration are intact, making Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome less likely. Myasthenia gravis is characterized by muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest, while spinal muscular atrophy typically presents earlier in life."
