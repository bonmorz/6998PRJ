Elevated serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) level is the most reliable laboratory finding to confirm the diagnosis of acromegaly. Elevated urine cortisol level is associated with Cushing's syndrome, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Low serum insulin level is characteristic of type 1 diabetes mellitus, which is also not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Elevated serum prolactin level is associated with prolactinoma, which can cause headache and visual disturbances, but it does not cause acromegaly."
