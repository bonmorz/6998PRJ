Factor X deficiency would present with prolonged PT and/or PTT, while the patient\u2019s bleeding time is prolonged, suggesting a problem with platelet function. Von Willebrand disease is the most likely diagnosis, as it leads to defective platelet adhesion and prolonged bleeding time.

Among the options listed, Von Willebrand disease is the most likely diagnosis based on the laboratory studies. The bleeding time is prolonged, indicating a platelet function defect, and the partial thromboplastin time is normal, which eliminates Factor X deficiency as a possibility. The normal leukocyte count also suggests a non-infectious etiology, which eliminates Bernard-Soulier Syndrome and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome as possibilities."

The normal platelet count and prothrombin time suggest that platelet and coagulation factor levels are within normal limits. The most likely diagnosis is Von Willebrand disease, which is a bleeding disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot due to a deficiency in Von Willebrand factor, a protein that helps platelets stick together and form clots. Bernard-Soulier Syndrome and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome also present with bleeding symptoms, but they are rare genetic disorders with different clinical features. Factor X deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder that affects the coagulation cascade, but it usually presents with more severe symptoms than what the patient is currently experiencing."

These findings point to a diagnosis of Von Willebrand disease, which is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of the Von Willebrand factor, a protein that plays a key role in platelet function and blood clotting. Bernard-Soulier Syndrome and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome are also inherited platelet disorders, but they typically present with more severe bleeding symptoms and abnormal platelet counts. Factor X deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of a specific coagulation factor and would show prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time on laboratory studies."

The patient\u2019s prolonged bleeding time and normal platelet count suggest a defect in clotting factors rather than platelets. The normal prothrombin time but prolonged partial thromboplastin time further suggests a deficiency in a non-activated clotting factor. Von Willebrand disease is the most likely diagnosis, as it is the most common congenital bleeding disorder and involves deficiencies or abnormalities in the Von Willebrand factor, which is critical for platelet adhesion and stability of clotting factors. The patient\u2019s history of prolonged bleeding after teeth extraction and bruises on the lower extremities further support this diagnosis. The other options are less likely based on this patient\u2019s presentation and laboratory findings."
