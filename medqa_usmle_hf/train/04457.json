The severe right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness on palpation supports this diagnosis. Luminal obstruction due to a fecalith would cause acute appendicitis.

Ascending infection of the urinary tract would present differently, such as with urinary symptoms like dysuria, frequency, and urgency. Immune-mediated vasculitis associated with IgA deposition would present with skin rashes, joint pain, and sometimes renal involvement."
