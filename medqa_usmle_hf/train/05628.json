Option A, electrical pain with neck flexion, is a classic symptom of trigeminal neuralgia, which can be seen in multiple sclerosis. Ipsilateral loss of proprioception and vibration sensation (Option B) would suggest a lesion in the dorsal column of the spinal cord, while symmetric lower extremity reflex loss (Option C) would suggest a systemic process, such as an electrolyte imbalance or polyneuropathy. Weakness with repeat exertion (Option D) is a symptom of myasthenia gravis, which is not likely the cause of the patient's symptoms."
