These symptoms suggest the possibility of diabetes insipidus (DI), which can be caused by lithium toxicity. The best initial test for the diagnosis of DI is the water deprivation test. This test involves the withholding of fluids followed by measurement of urine osmolality and plasma osmolality. If the urine is not concentrated and plasma osmolality increases above a certain point, it is suggestive of DI. CT thorax and chest X-ray are not indicated in this patient as there is no sign of respiratory symptoms or abnormalities on physical examination. Serum ADH level can be helpful in diagnosing the type of DI (central vs. nephrogenic), but it is not useful as an initial test."
