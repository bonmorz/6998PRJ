The key findings of Crohn's disease - involvement of the terminal ileum with patchy disease and inflammation leading to thickening of the entire wall - are consistent with the formation of fistulas. Fistulas are abnormal connections that form between two organs or between an organ and skin surface. They can occur in Crohn's disease due to the inflammation and thickening of the intestinal wall. Toxic megacolon is a complication of ulcerative colitis, not Crohn's disease. Widening of the intestinal lumen and Plummer-Vinson syndrome are not directly related to Crohn's disease."
