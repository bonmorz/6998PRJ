The symptoms suggest that the patient had a traumatic event resulting in convulsions and loss of consciousness, followed by intense headaches and nausea on admission. The inability to fully abduct both eyes, nuchal rigidity, and positive Kernig sign suggest meningitis. As a result, a lumbar puncture is needed to check for cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities, such as increased pressure or white blood cells, to confirm or rule out meningitis. Brain MRI and angiography are more expensive and not urgent in this case, while sonography will not provide useful information for this particular presentation."
