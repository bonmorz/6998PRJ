The heart rate is also low at 47/min, indicating the use of an artificial pacemaker. The location of the pacemaker is determined by the morphology of the QRS complex, which in this case is narrow and normal, indicating that the pacemaker is in the AV node. Therefore, the answer is (B) AV node."

Atrial myocardium pacing would typically display a P wave before the QRS complex, while Purkinje fiber pacing would typically display a wide QRS complex."

These findings suggest that the patient may have 2nd degree AV block, particularly Type I, also known as Mobitz I or Wenckebach. This type of AV block is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval until one of the atrial impulses is blocked and does not conduct to the ventricle, resulting in a dropped beat. The pacemaker site for this patient is likely the AV node, as the atrial impulses are being conducted through the AV node before being blocked."
