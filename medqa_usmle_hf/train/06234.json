The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, lower extremity swelling, and weight gain are suggestive of heart failure. Crackles on chest auscultation suggest pulmonary edema. The auscultation findings of a low-pitched early diastolic sound that becomes louder in the left lateral decubitus position at end-expiration are classic for an S3 gallop, which is associated with increased left ventricular end-systolic volume. This suggests that the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is decreased cardiac output due to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Decreased left myocardial compliance, increased ventricular contractility, and decreased left-ventricular filling pressure are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and auscultation findings."

The specific auscultation findings, a dull early diastolic sound that becomes louder in the left lateral decubitus position at end-expiration, are characteristic of a left-sided S3 heart sound, which indicates a high left ventricular end-systolic volume. Thus, the most likely cause of these findings is increased left ventricular end-systolic volume.
