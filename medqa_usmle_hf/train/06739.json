Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies attack the acetylcholine receptors on muscle cells, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. About 15% of patients with myasthenia gravis have thymomas (tumors of the thymus gland), and it is believed that the presence of these tumors triggers an autoimmune response. The thymus gland is involved in the development of T cells, and in myasthenia gravis, it is thought that thymic epithelial cells may be involved in presenting acetylcholine receptor peptides to developing T cells, leading to the production of acetylcholine receptor antibodies. The portion of the thymus designated by the arrow in the image may be the part of the gland where immature T cells undergo negative selection (elimination of self-reactive T cells), and failure of apoptosis (programmed cell death) of negatively selected T cells may result in the production of autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptor. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) failure of apoptosis of negatively selected T cells."
