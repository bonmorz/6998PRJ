The patient presents with progressive cognitive decline, involuntary muscle jerking, and a blunt affect, which are indicative of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare, degenerative, and fatal brain disorder. None of the other options fully match the symptoms presented by the patient. Alzheimer's disease is also a degenerative disease but the patient's muscle jerking suggests something else. Huntington's disease causes involuntary movements but it also includes cognitive decline and the patient's symptoms are too severe too quickly. Normal pressure hydrocephalus includes dementia, gait abnormalities, and urinary incontinence, but not involuntary muscle jerking."

Huntington\u2019s disease typically presents with chorea, which is a writhing, dance-like movement, rather than involuntary jerking.
