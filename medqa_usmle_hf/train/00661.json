The patient's symptoms, including pain in great toe, hips, and knees, worse with activity, and with crepitus of the hip suggest osteoarthritis. The recent travel history and unprotected sex are not relevant to the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. The patient's alcohol consumption and medical history may contribute to the development of osteoarthritis. Infectious arthritis would have a more acute onset with fever and systemic symptoms. Gout and pseudogout are both types of crystal-induced arthritis and commonly present with acute pain and swelling in a single joint, not the multiple joints that this patient is experiencing."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest osteoarthritis, which is common in elderly patients with a history of obesity and prior joint injury. The recent travel history and unprotected sex are risk factors for infections, but there are no systemic symptoms such as fever or chills, which would be seen in infectious arthritis. Gout and pseudogout usually present with sudden onset of joint pain and swelling, which is not consistent with the patient\u2019s history of progressively worsened symptoms. The patient\u2019s alcohol use may increase his risk for gout, but this is not the most likely diagnosis based on his symptoms and physical exam findings."

Gout and pseudogout typically present with acute attacks of joint inflammation, which does not fit with the patient's progressive and chronic symptoms.
