The patient has a history of smoking and presents with hematuria and weight loss, which are common symptoms of bladder cancer. Additionally, the palpable liver edge and splenomegaly suggest possible liver metastases, which can lead to elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer. Calcified cysts in the liver are typically seen in patients with polycystic liver disease, whereas atrophy of the retina with sclerosing keratitis and peripheral nonpitting edema are characteristic of sarcoidosis and heart failure, respectively. None of these conditions are related to bladder cancer."
