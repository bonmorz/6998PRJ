The absence of ketones and normal glucose levels suggest a metabolic rather than diabetic cause. The elevated ALT and AST suggest liver dysfunction, and the hemoglobin and MCV levels suggest mild anemia. These findings all point to a deficiency in acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which would lead to impaired fatty acid oxidation and an inability to maintain glucose levels during periods of fasting, such as during a hike without snacks. \u03b1-glucosidase deficiency can cause glycogen storage disease type II, which presents with cardiomegaly and myopathy. Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency results in von Gierke disease, presenting with hepatomegaly and hypoglycemia. Nicotinic acid is a form of vitamin B3 and not involved in this patient's symptoms."
