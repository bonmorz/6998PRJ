The patient's symptoms suggest a fungal infection, possibly tinea capitis and tinea pedis, and the most accurate test would be a culture in Sabouraud liquid medium to identify the specific type of fungus causing the infection. Wood's lamp can also be used to identify some types of fungal infections but it is not as accurate as culture. KOH preparation of scalp scraping can also be used but it may not identify all types of fungi. CBC and total serum IgE are not specific tests for fungal infections, although they may be useful in helping to rule out other causes of the rash."
