However, given that the patient has sickle cell disease, he is at greatest risk for hearing loss, as this is a common complication of meningitis in patients with sickle cell disease. Adrenal insufficiency is a potential complication of prolonged use of glucocorticoid therapy, but there is no indication of this in the case. Cerebral palsy and communicating hydrocephalus are not associated complications of meningitis."
