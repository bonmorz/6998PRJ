The clinical and laboratory findings suggest acute pancreatitis with pancreatic enlargement and elevated amylase and lipase levels. The history of alcohol consumption and abdominal tenderness also support this diagnosis. Fat necrosis is a common histologic finding in acute pancreatitis, which occurs as a result of release of digestive enzymes from the pancreas that damage the surrounding adipose tissue. Therefore, the answer is (B) fat necrosis."

The sudden onset of severe mid-epigastric pain and profuse vomiting suggests acute pancreatitis, which is confirmed by the laboratory findings showing elevated serum amylase and lipase. The diffuse pancreatic enlargement seen on abdominal CT scan is associated with fat necrosis. Coagulative necrosis usually occurs in ischemic injury, dry gangrene occurs in chronic reduced blood flow and colliquative necrosis occurs in liquefaction of tissue due to autolysis or bacterial infection. None of these are commonly associated with acute pancreatitis."

The elevated serum amylase and lipase levels confirm the diagnosis. The CT scan shows diffuse pancreatic enlargement and peritoneal fluid collection, which is consistent with edema and inflammation. Fat necrosis is the most likely cellular change that occurs in acute pancreatitis due to the release of activated pancreatic lipase that causes autodigestion of adipose tissue leading to the formation of fatty acids and glycerol."
