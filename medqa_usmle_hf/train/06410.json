The positive direct antiglobulin test suggests the presence of antibodies on the surface of the patient's red blood cells, indicating immune-mediated hemolysis.

This is a common complication of systemic lupus erythematosus. Red cell membrane defects and IgM-mediated hemolysis are less likely to cause this presentation.

The patient has symptoms of anemia and jaundice, and laboratory results show a positive direct antiglobulin test and spherocytes on peripheral blood smear, suggesting immune hemolysis. IgG-mediated hemolysis is the most common type of immune hemolysis, which can occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Red cell membrane defects usually cause hereditary spherocytosis, which is unlikely given the patient's medical history. IgM-mediated hemolysis is rare and usually associated with infections or malignancies. Chronic inflammation may cause anemia of chronic disease but would not explain the positive direct antiglobulin test and spherocytes on peripheral blood smear."
