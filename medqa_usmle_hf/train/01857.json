Inhibitors of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) are commonly used to treat erectile dysfunction, and their primary site of action is the corpus cavernosum of the penis, where they enhance the effects of nitric oxide-mediated relaxation of smooth muscle. Option (B) is incorrect because the prostate does not play a direct role in penile erection. Option (C) is incorrect because the corpus spongiosum is primarily involved in maintaining the rigidity of the glans penis during erection. Option (D) is incorrect because the pudendal nerve is a sensory and motor nerve that innervates the external genitalia, but it does not directly affect penile erection."
