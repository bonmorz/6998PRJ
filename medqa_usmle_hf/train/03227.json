The patient's chronic smoking and hypertension are risk factors for atherosclerosis that can lead to cerebrovascular accidents (strokes). This question is asking about a blood lipid component that contributes to atherosclerosis. Among the options, ox-LDL is known to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by inducing endothelial cell dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, and smooth muscle cell proliferation. High levels of ox-LDL have been found in patients with acute ischemic stroke. VLDL is a precursor of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which can also contribute to atherosclerosis. LPL is an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides in lipoproteins, and HDL-cholesterol is known to have protective effects against atherosclerosis. However, neither LPL nor HDL-cholesterol is directly related to the development of atherosclerosis."
