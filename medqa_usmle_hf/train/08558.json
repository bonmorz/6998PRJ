Azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are both prophylactic antibiotics that are recommended for use in HIV-infected patients with low CD4+ counts to prevent infections like Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and toxoplasmosis. Fluconazole is used as prophylaxis for fungal infections, but it is not recommended in this case as the patient's low CD4+ count puts him at higher risk for bacterial and protozoal infections. Dapsone is used in combination with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, but it is not necessary to add it in this scenario as the patient is already receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole."
