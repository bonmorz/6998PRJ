Atrioventricular block can be treated with drugs that dilate the pupil, such as atropine, which can cause acute angle-closure glaucoma. Hypertensive crisis can be treated with drugs that lower blood pressure, which is not related to the patient's symptoms. Mitral regurgitation and viral pleuritis do not involve the use of drugs that can cause acute angle-closure glaucoma."

The symptoms of severe left eye pain, decreased vision of the left eye, fixed mid-dilated pupil, and narrowed anterior chamber suggest that the patient has experienced an acute angle-closure glaucoma. This condition is a known side effect of drugs used to treat atrioventricular block, such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers. Therefore, the patient was most likely treated for atrioventricular block."
