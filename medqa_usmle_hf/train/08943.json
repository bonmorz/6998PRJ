Laser iridotomy is used for angle-closure glaucoma, which presents with a sudden onset of symptoms and signs."

Latanoprost is a prostaglandin analog that increases the outflow of aqueous humor, reducing intraocular pressure and is the most appropriate next step. Pilocarpine is a cholinergic drug that constricts the pupil and opens the trabecular meshwork, increasing the outflow of aqueous humor, but it is not the first-line treatment. Timolol is a beta-blocker that decreases the production of aqueous humor, but it's not the best option for this patient. Laser iridotomy is used for angle-closure glaucoma, which is not the case here as gonioscopy showed no abnormalities."
