The patient's symptoms suggest a bleeding disorder, and his laboratory results indicate prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, which are both indicative of impaired activation of factor VII in the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways. Resistance of factor V inactivation is associated with a hypercoagulable state, not bleeding. Decreased synthesis of thrombopoietin results in thrombocytopenia, not prolonged clotting times. Deficiency of folic acid does not cause bleeding disorders."

The laboratory studies show prolonged prothrombin time, suggesting impaired activation of factor VII in the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. Option A is incorrect because resistance of Factor V inactivation is associated with factor V Leiden mutation which is an inherited clotting disorder. Option C is incorrect because the platelet count is normal, and thrombopoietin is involved in platelet production. Option D is incorrect because folic acid deficiency is not associated with bleeding disorders."

The abnormal prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time support a factor deficiency. Impaired activation of factor VII is the most likely underlying cause, as it is essential for the extrinsic pathway of coagulation, which is responsible for hemostasis in surgical wounds. Resistance of Factor V inactivation is associated with thrombosis (clotting), not bleeding. Decreased synthesis of thrombopoietin would lead to a low platelet count, which is not the case in this patient. Deficiency of folic acid is associated with megaloblastic anemia but would not cause the bleeding and bruising seen in this patient."
