Erosive gastritis and multiple ulcers suggest Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), a condition where gastrin-secreting tumors cause hypersecretion of gastric acid. The best next step in management is a secretin stimulation test to differentiate ZES from other conditions with elevated gastrin levels, such as atrophic gastritis or pernicious anemia. Empiric triple therapy for H. pylori is not appropriate since biopsy was negative for the bacteria. Serum chromogranin A and prolactin levels can help diagnose neuroendocrine tumors and pituitary adenomas respectively, but are not directly related to ZES."
