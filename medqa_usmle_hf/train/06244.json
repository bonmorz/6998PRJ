The symptoms and signs, including the history of sore throat, erythematous ring-shaped macules and patches, audible S3, and joint pain suggest acute rheumatic fever. Viral myocarditis usually presents with chest pain instead of a sore throat and joint pain. Systemic lupus erythematosus usually has a positive antinuclear antibody test as well as other specific criteria. Borrelia burgdorferi infection causes Lyme disease, which usually does not involve the heart."

The patient had a sore throat and erythematous ring-shaped macules and patches are common skin manifestations of rheumatic fever. Jugular venous distension and ankle edema suggest heart failure, which is a complication of rheumatic fever. The S3 heard on cardiac auscultation further supports this diagnosis. Prominent vascular markings on chest x-ray indicate pulmonary hypertension often seen with chronic rheumatic heart disease. Viral myocarditis usually presents with recent viral illness and elevated cardiac enzymes. Systemic lupus erythematosus can cause cardiovascular symptoms but the skin manifestations and recent sore throat point towards rheumatic fever. Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi does not have these symptoms."

The S3 heard on cardiac auscultation is also consistent with acute rheumatic fever. Viral myocarditis and systemic lupus erythematosus can present with similar symptoms, but the presence of erythema marginatum points to acute rheumatic fever.
