The size of the mass is significant and suggests the need for surgical removal. The ureter runs along the pelvic sidewall adjacent to the ovary, so it must be diligently protected during the surgery to avoid injury. Injury to the cardinal ligament of the uterus could result in uterine prolapse in the future, but this ligament is not in close proximity to the ovary. The external iliac artery is located higher and more lateral and would not be in jeopardy during surgery. The ovarian ligament is not a major structure at risk during the removal of an ovarian mass."
