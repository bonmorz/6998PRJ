The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection, including dysuria, chills, and fever, and the physical exam shows pain in the right lower quadrant and flank area. The gynecologist's comment on ovarian cysts is not necessarily related to this current presentation. Ascending infection of the urinary tract is the most likely pathophysiology given these symptoms. The other options (cessation of venous drainage from the ovaries, inflammation of the appendix, vesicoureteral reflex) are less likely based on the patient's presentation."
