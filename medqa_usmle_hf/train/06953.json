The elevated T3 and normal free T4 suggest that the patient may have early stages of thyroid dysfunction, possibly induced by her recent oral contraceptive use. Lithium may also affect thyroid function, but it typically results in decreased thyroid hormone levels. Familial hyperthyroidism and hypocholesterolemia are not supported by the laboratory results or the patient\u2019s history."

The most likely cause of the patient\u2019s abnormal lab values is oral contraception-induced changes in thyroid function. Combined oral contraceptives can increase thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) production, leading to an increase in total T4 and T3 levels, but no change in free T4 and T3 levels. This is known as euthyroid sick syndrome. Familial hyperthyroidism and hypocholesterolemia are not associated with these lab findings. Lithium can lead to hypothyroidism and can cause an increase in TSH levels. However, the patient\u2019s TSH level is within the normal range."
