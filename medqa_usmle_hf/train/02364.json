The other options would have different physical exam findings, such as anterior or posterior drawer tests for ACL or PCL tears, and valgus stress for MCL tear. The bruising and pain suggest a possible contusion or hematoma as well. The patient should be advised to avoid athletics until the injury has healed and he can bear weight on the knee without pain. Depending on the severity of the tear, conservative management such as RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) and physical therapy may be recommended, or surgical repair may be necessary."
