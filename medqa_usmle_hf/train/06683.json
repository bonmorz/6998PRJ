Indomethacin and colchicine are gout treatments and are not indicated for septic arthritis, while ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam are not broad enough for possible causative organisms."

Prompt treatment is necessary to avoid irreversible joint damage. Given the patient\u2019s history of gout, the possibility of crystal-induced arthritis should also be considered. While indomethacin and colchicine may be effective for gout, it is not appropriate for septic arthritis. Ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam are commonly used for empirical treatment of septic arthritis, but they do not cover MRSA which is a common cause of septic arthritis. Vancomycin, which covers MRSA, and ceftazidime, which covers gram-negative organisms, are usually the best choice for empirical coverage until sensitivities are known."

Ceftriaxone is not recommended due to its limited spectrum of activity against gram-negative organisms. Indomethacin and colchicine are used in the treatment of acute gouty arthritis but are not indicated for septic arthritis. Piperacillin-tazobactam does not provide adequate gram-positive coverage."

The patient\u2019s gout and recent onset of symptoms in the left knee suggest he may have septic arthritis, with the high leukocyte count and neutrophil percentage in the synovial fluid supporting this diagnosis.

Choice A is not recommended because it does not cover gram-positive organisms, which are more commonly implicated in septic arthritis. Choice B is not appropriate because it would be contraindicated in a patient with suspected septic arthritis due to its potential to exacerbate infection. Choice C may cover gram-negative organisms, but does not provide coverage for gram-positive organisms."
