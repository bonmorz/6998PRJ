Her family history also suggests a potential genetic predisposition to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Additionally, the presence of tremors and slow gait with mild stooped posture suggests Parkinson\u2019s disease. However, laboratory findings do not support a Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis, with serum creatinine levels 10 times above normal range. Based on these factors, the most appropriate management for this patient would be medication to improve cognitive function, such as rivastigmine, which is used to treat mild to moderate dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and penicillamine is used to treat Wilson\u2019s disease.
