Treatment for PDA depends on the size of the PDA and the clinical presentation of the patient. In this case, as the patient is asymptomatic and the PDA is not causing significant hemodynamic compromise, a trial of indomethacin infusion would be the most appropriate first-line treatment. Prostaglandin E1 infusion would be used to maintain the patency of the ductus arteriosus in cases of ductal-dependent congenital heart defects. Surgical ligation and percutaneous surgery would be indicated if medical therapy fails or if the patient develops significant symptoms."
