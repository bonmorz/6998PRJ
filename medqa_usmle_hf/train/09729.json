The patient\u2019s symptoms and delayed nystagmus suggest peripheral vestibular dysfunction, likely due to Meniere's disease. The first-line treatment is a low-salt diet, which has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms. The Epley maneuver is used to treat positional vertigo, and meclizine can be used for acute symptom relief. Thiamine is not indicated in this case. The patient\u2019s alcoholism and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may be contributing factors to his symptoms and should also be addressed."
