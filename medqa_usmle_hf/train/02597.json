The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and the next best step in management to monitor disease activity is to check anti-dsDNA antibody levels.

Anti-Smith antibody levels are helpful in diagnosing lupus but not in monitoring disease activity. Arthrocentesis and synovial fluid analysis are useful in evaluating joint pain and swelling but are not specific to lupus monitoring."
