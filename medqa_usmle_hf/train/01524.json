The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest renal artery stenosis, which is a common cause of secondary hypertension in older individuals. Renal ultrasound with Doppler can help diagnose this condition and guide treatment. CT abdomen/pelvis can also show the renal arteries, but it is not as sensitive as renal ultrasound with Doppler. Increasing the dose of current blood pressure medications or starting a new medication without addressing the underlying cause would not be a good approach. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, which may have some benefit in this case, but addressing the underlying cause should be the priority."
