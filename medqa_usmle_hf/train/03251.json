The family history of colon cancer also increases the suspicion. Therefore, the next best step in management is colonoscopy to evaluate for any pathology. Anti-endomysial antibody titer is a test for celiac disease, which is less likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms since a gluten-free diet did not improve her symptoms. High fiber diet may help with constipation, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Thyroid ultrasound is not indicated for the evaluation of abdominal pain."
