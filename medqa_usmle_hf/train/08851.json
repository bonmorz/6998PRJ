The study could have been improved with proper randomization to ensure that there is an equal distribution of patient characteristics and potential confounding factors between the two groups, minimizing the risk of bias. The study could also have been improved with larger sample size to increase the power of the study and reduce the risk of type II error. In addition, a retrial of the primary outcome for clinical effectiveness instead of non-inferiority could have provided clearer results. Finally, posthoc analysis of the primary outcome among patients who withdrew from the study may not be effective in improving the study as it can introduce biases and cannot account for the reasons why patients withdrew from the study."

The study could have been improved with randomization to ensure that the comparison groups are as similar as possible at baseline.

Increased sample size may also help improve study power, but it would not address the fundamental issue of non-random selection. Retrial of primary outcome for clinical effectiveness instead of non-inferiority would fundamentally change the research question being asked. Posthoc analysis of primary outcome among patients who withdrew from the study would introduce selection bias and would not address the issues with randomization and blinding."

Randomization ensures that there is no bias in the allocation of treatments, which is crucial to reduce the risk of confounding factors. The sample size is also an important factor, but increasing it may not have addressed the issues with the study design. Retrial for clinical effectiveness and post hoc analysis of patients who withdrew may provide additional information but will not address the bias in treatment allocation. Thus, the study could have been improved by randomization."

The study could have been improved by using proper randomization methods to ensure that the two groups (losartan and salisartan) are comparable in terms of baseline characteristics such as age, gender, ethnicity, weight, and other relevant factors that may affect the outcome. This would help to reduce bias and improve the generalizability of the results. Additionally, a larger sample size may improve the power of the study and increase the precision of the estimates. It may also be beneficial to re-evaluate the primary outcome to assess clinical effectiveness instead of focusing solely on non-inferiority. Hypothesis testing should also be conducted to assess the significance of the results and to determine the likelihood of obtaining similar results in future studies."
