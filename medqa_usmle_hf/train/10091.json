Neglect is defined as \"the failure to provide for a child's basic needs, including inadequate supervision, insufficient food, clothing, and hygiene, as well as medical, dental, and mental health needs.\" This patient's history suggests neglect as a form of child abuse, as he has not received proper medical care, has missed several vaccines, and is often left unattended at home. The fact that his mother was too busy to take him to the emergency department after he was hit by a car reinforces the idea of neglect. Physical abuse and sexual abuse may involve intentional harm while psychological abuse involves emotional harm. Although the patient has been hit by a car, the lack of proper care and supervision suggests neglect as the most appropriate term for this type of child abuse."
