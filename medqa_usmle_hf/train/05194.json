In this case, the patient has experienced an acute worsening of symptoms, which may require more than just topical treatment. Methotrexate is a first-line systemic therapy for psoriasis, which can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms. Skin biopsy may confirm the diagnosis, but treatment can be initiated based on clinical presentation. Phototherapy or biologic agents like infliximab may be considered if methotrexate is not effective or contraindicated."
