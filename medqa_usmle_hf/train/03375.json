The picture of the patient's eye suggests Wilson disease, which is a genetic disorder that causes copper to accumulate in various organs including the brain, liver, and eyes. The best initial management is oral zinc, which decreases the absorption of copper in the gut and increases its excretion in the urine. Penicillamine and deferasirox are also used for Wilson disease, but they have more side effects and should be reserved for patients who do not respond to zinc or who have severe disease. Watchful waiting is not appropriate for a progressive disease like Wilson disease."
