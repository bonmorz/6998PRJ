The patient has signs of Cushing's syndrome, which can be caused by prolonged use of glucocorticoids, and presents with weight gain, excessive facial hair, and purplish striae. Hypokalemia is a common finding in patients with Cushing's syndrome due to the effects of excess cortisol on the body. Hyperkalemia is not a typical finding. Random blood glucose levels may be elevated, but not necessarily consistently. Metabolic acidosis is not a common finding."

The symptoms of weight gain, excess facial hair, and purplish striae on abdomen suggests Cushing's syndrome, often caused by long-term use of steroids for inflammatory bowel disease. Hypokalemia is a common finding in Cushing's syndrome due to increased mineralocorticoid activity. Hyperkalemia is more indicative of adrenal insufficiency. Normal blood glucose levels would not be expected in Cushing's syndrome, as it often causes insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Metabolic acidosis is not a common finding in Cushing's syndrome."

The history of weight gain, excessive facial hair, and purplish striae on the abdomen suggests Cushing\u2019s Syndrome, which often involves an excess of cortisol. Hypokalemia is commonly seen in patients with Cushing\u2019s Syndrome due to the effect of cortisol on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Hyperkalemia is unlikely since cortisol promotes the excretion of potassium. Normal random blood glucose levels and metabolic acidosis are also unlikely in this case."
