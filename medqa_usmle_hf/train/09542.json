The patient\u2019s age and family history suggest that she may benefit from a shingles vaccine, which is recommended for adults aged 50 and older. Colonoscopy is recommended every 10 years starting at age 50, so she may need another one in the near future. Influenza vaccine is recommended yearly for all adults, but she received one 2 years ago. Tetanus vaccine is recommended every 10 years, so she is due for another booster soon."

Although all options may be warranted in the future, the patient\u2019s family history of breast cancer and her age, suggest that the most appropriate recommendation at this time is for her to receive the shingles vaccine. Her recent colonoscopy, Pap smear, and mammogram also show that she is up-to-date on cancer screenings. The patient\u2019s history of regular physical activity and back pain suggest that she is unlikely to have undiagnosed colon cancer, and her recent influenza vaccine and multivitamin use indicate that she is conscientious about her health. A tetanus booster is typically recommended every 10 years, and the patient\u2019s last one was 6 years ago, so it is not an urgent recommendation."
