The patient\u2019s symptoms, including urinary frequency, discomfort during urination, and symmetrically enlarged and smooth prostate, suggest benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Renal ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step to assess the urinary tract and look for any complications related to BPH or possible renal cell carcinoma, given the patient\u2019s family history. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is not necessary at this stage. Transrectal ultrasonography is useful for diagnosing prostate cancer or BPH, but the patient has already been diagnosed with BPH through rectal examination. Ureteral stenting is also unnecessary at this stage as there are no indications of ureteral obstruction."
