The symptoms described are consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to scarring of the fallopian tubes and potentially infertility if left untreated. Definitive treatment for PID may require surgical intervention to remove any abscesses or to drain any collection of fluid that has developed. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Surgery. The other options are incorrect because ceftriaxone and azithromycin are antibiotics used to treat gonorrhea and chlamydia, and increasing the dose of sulfasalazine will not treat the underlying infection. IV ceftriaxone may be used in severe cases of PID, but it is not the definitive treatment."
