Option B suggests celiac disease, which is associated with dermatitis herpetiformis, but this condition shows different skin lesions. Linear deposits of IgG and C3 along the basement membrane is the characteristic finding in bullous pemphigoid, which is an autoimmune disorder that presents with tense blisters and pruritus in elderly patients, especially those with a history of other autoimmune diseases. Due to his past medical history, this patient may have additional autoimmune disorders."
