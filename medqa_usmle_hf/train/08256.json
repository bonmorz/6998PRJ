Two days later, the patient's symptoms have improved but there are changes in laboratory values including a decrease in platelet count and an increase in partial thromboplastin time. These changes suggest heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and switching to enoxaparin or warfarin is contraindicated in HIT. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to continue with unfractionated heparin and monitor for further complications."
