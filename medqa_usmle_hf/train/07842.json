Given the patient's history of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and recent switch to warfarin, his laboratory results suggest he has an elevated INR and a prolonged PT, indicating a risk for bleeding. Since the next operating room is not available for several hours, the best next step for surgical optimization is to administer fresh frozen plasma to correct the anticoagulation and decrease the risk of bleeding during surgery. Phytonadione (vitamin K) would also be useful in reversing warfarin anticoagulation, but it takes longer to work and is not the best option in this time-sensitive scenario. Protamine is used to reverse heparin-induced anticoagulation, which is not relevant in this case. Doing nothing would not address the elevated risk of bleeding during surgery."

Phytonadione (vitamin K) can also be considered, but the effects may not be immediate enough for urgent surgery. Protamine is used to reverse heparin, which is not relevant in this case. Doing nothing is not a safe option as it increases the risk of bleeding during surgery."

The surgical consult team has made a clinical diagnosis and surgical intervention is likely necessary in the near future. However, the patient needs surgical optimization, which includes reversal of the warfarin anticoagulation. Fresh frozen plasma is the best option to rapidly correct warfarin-associated anticoagulation.

Option A is not acceptable since surgical optimization is necessary before surgery."
