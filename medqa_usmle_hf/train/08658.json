The best course of action would be to schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks, during which the patient can be assessed for improvement or worsening of symptoms. Starting on a small dose of fluoxetine could be a treatment option, but it would need to be monitored closely, and the patient should be advised not to breastfeed while taking the medication. Admission or electroconvulsive therapy are not necessary at this stage."
