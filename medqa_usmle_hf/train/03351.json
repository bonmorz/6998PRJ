The ductus venosus is a shunt between the umbilical vein and the inferior vena cava that allows oxygenated blood to bypass the fetal liver and flow directly to the heart. As a result, the blood in the ductus venosus has the highest concentration of oxygen and the lowest concentration of deoxyhemoglobin, leading to a higher T2 signal on MRI. Pulmonary veins and the right atrium carry oxygenated blood while the superior vena cava carries partially deoxygenated blood, making them less likely to have a high T2 signal."

In a normal fetus, the ductus venosus shunts oxygen-rich blood from the umbilical vein directly to the inferior vena cava, bypassing the liver. Since the T2 signal is inversely related to the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin, the ductus venosus will have the highest T2 signal because it contains the most oxygen-rich blood. Pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood but they are not relevant in fetal circulation. The superior vena cava and right atrium contain deoxygenated blood, which will produce a low signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI."

The ductus venosus allows oxygenated blood from the umbilical vein to bypass the liver and enter the inferior vena cava. This blood then flows into the right atrium and ventricle and is pumped to the pulmonary artery to oxygenate the fetal lungs. Therefore, the T2 signal is most likely to be highest in the ductus venosus because it contains the highest concentration of oxygenated blood. Pulmonary veins and the superior vena cava carry oxygenated blood, but they have already gone through gas exchange in the fetal lungs and are not as oxygenated as the blood in the ductus venosus. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body and therefore should have a lower T2 signal."
