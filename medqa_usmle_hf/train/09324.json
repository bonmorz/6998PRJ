The symptoms suggest Pemphigus vulgaris, which is an autoimmune disease that causes blistering and erosions of the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by the formation of IgG autoantibodies against desmoglein 1 and/or 3, which are adhesion molecules in the skin that help maintain the structure of the epidermis. This leads to the breakdown of the skin and mucous membranes, resulting in blisters and erosions. The fact that the top layer of skin can be easily removed is known as the Nikolsky sign, which is characteristic of Pemphigus vulgaris."

The patient's previous treatment for herpes simplex stomatitis suggests that the symptoms were initially mistaken for another condition. Behcet's disease can cause skin eruptions, but it is usually associated with other symptoms such as genital ulcers and eye inflammation. Dermatitis herpetiformis causes itchy blisters on the skin, but it is not usually associated with oral involvement. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a severe but rare disorder that causes widespread skin loss and systemic symptoms, which are not present in this case."
