The blurry vision and double vision symptoms suggest increased intracranial pressure, and the fundoscopic examination shows papilledema. A lumbar puncture should be done to measure the opening pressure and to provide symptomatic relief. Emergent craniotomy and cerebral shunt are not necessary at this stage. Acetazolamide therapy can be used to treat increased intracranial pressure, but a lumbar puncture should be done first to measure the opening pressure."
