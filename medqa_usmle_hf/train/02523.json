The symptoms and the gram-negative non-lactose fermenting rods suggest pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, which secretes exotoxin A that inhibits protein synthesis in host cells.

Options A and B suggest mechanisms commonly used by bacteria to cause infections, but they do not apply to pseudomonas aeruginosa. Option D is not related to any known mechanism of bacterial virulence factor."
