The patient\u2019s recent arrival from Sudan, lack of immunization history, and pre-auricular lymphadenopathy all suggest an infectious etiology. Angular conjunctivitis is caused by Staphylococcus aureus and presents with itching, burning, and redness at the corners of the eye, and is not associated with corneal haziness or neovascularization. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is caused by enterovirus or adenovirus and presents with severe eye pain, purulent discharge, and subconjunctival hemorrhages. Neisserial conjunctivitis is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and presents with purulent discharge and severe eye pain."

Angular conjunctivitis and acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis typically do not cause corneal involvement.

A slit-lamp examination shows follicles in the limbic region and the bulbar conjunctiva, as well as corneal haziness with neovascularization at the 12 o'clock position. These are all indicative of trachoma conjunctivitis. Angular conjunctivitis causes a discharge from the corner of the eye, while acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is characterized by bleeding under the conjunctiva. Neisserial conjunctivitis typically occurs in sexually active young adults and presents with a purulent discharge."
