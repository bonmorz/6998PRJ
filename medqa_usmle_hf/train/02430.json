Pacinian corpuscles are large in size and myelinated, and they use large, myelinated nerve fibers to transmit sensory information. Option A refers to A-delta fibers, which are small and myelinated and used for sharp, localized pain. Option B refers to C fibers, which are small and unmyelinated and used for dull, aching pain. Option D refers to dendritic endings, which are components of sensory neurons but not a type of nerve fiber."

The receptor that is encased in deep skin layers and joints and adapts quickly is most likely a Meissner corpuscle. These corpuscles are encapsulated and have a single large, myelinated afferent fiber that transmits sensory information. Therefore, the answer is (C). Small, myelinated fibers are associated with fast pain and temperature sensation. Large, unmyelinated fibers are associated with slow, dull pain. Dendritic endings are not specific to any particular type of sensation."
