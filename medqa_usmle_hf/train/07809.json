Cancer antigen-125 is often associated with ovarian cancer, which may be a differential diagnosis in this case, but it is not the most likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and findings. Carcinoembryonic antigen is associated with colorectal and other cancers, and testosterone is not typically associated with gynecologic cancers."
