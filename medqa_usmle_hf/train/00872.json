The patient's use of daily ibuprofen for his lower back pain could be causing his abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleeding. The fact that the pain is worse after meals could also be suggestive of a peptic ulcer, which can be caused by long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen. Physiologic stress, alcohol use, and family history of cancer are all potential risk factors for certain health conditions, but they are not the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms based on the information given."
