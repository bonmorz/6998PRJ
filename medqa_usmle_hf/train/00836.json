The presenting symptoms suggest pertussis, which has three stages - the catarrhal stage, the paroxysmal stage, and the convalescent stage. The catarrhal stage lasts for 1-2 weeks and is characterized by upper respiratory symptoms. The paroxysmal stage lasts for 2-4 weeks, during which the patient will have fits of coughing followed by gasping for breath. The patient may vomit after coughing fits. The convalescent stage lasts for several weeks and is marked by gradual resolution of symptoms. The conjunctival hemorrhages are also characteristic of pertussis in the paroxysmal stage. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) paroxysmal stage."
