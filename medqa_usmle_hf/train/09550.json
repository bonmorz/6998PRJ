The patient has back pain and numbness in the lower extremities, decreased sensation to temperature and pinprick below the waist, and 0/5 muscle strength in the lower extremities, which indicate a spinal cord injury. The presence of intact vibration sense and absent deep tendon reflexes suggest that the injury is in the anterior spinal cord. Thus, the most likely diagnosis is anterior spinal artery syndrome. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome affects the peripheral nervous system, Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome is a rare spinal cord injury that affects only one side of the body, and Posterior spinal artery syndrome affects the posterior spinal cord."

The tuning fork test indicates that the nerves are intact, ruling out Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome and Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome. Posterior spinal artery syndrome would present with different neurological deficits, such as loss of proprioception and vibration sense but preserved pain and temperature sensation."
