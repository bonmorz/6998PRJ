The subthalamic nucleus is involved in movement control but is not specifically related to hyperreflexia. The lateral geniculate nucleus is involved in visual processing and the postcentral gyrus is involved in somatosensory processing, but neither of these structures would explain the hyperreflexia."

However, based on the information provided in the question stem, the most likely location of the patient's lesion is the internal capsule. The internal capsule is a band of white matter in the brain that contains many motor and sensory fibers, so damage to this area can cause weakness and hyperreflexia on one side of the body. The subthalamic nucleus is involved in motor control and does not typically cause weakness on one side of the body, while the lateral geniculate nucleus is involved in visual processing and the postcentral gyrus is involved in somatosensory processing, neither of which are likely to cause the symptoms described in the question stem."
