The increased heart rate in normal mice suggests a more efficient calcium release and reuptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum due to greater T-tubule density, which allows for more effective depolarization of the cardiomyocytes. Greater cardiomyocyte size or ratio of heart to body weight would not necessarily result in an increased heart rate. Lower number of gap junctions may impair communication between cardiomyocytes and result in decreased contractility rather than increased heart rate."
