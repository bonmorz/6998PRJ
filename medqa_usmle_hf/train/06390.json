If the mother is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive, there is a risk for Rh incompatibility between the mother and fetus. Administering RhoGAM can prevent the mother from developing antibodies against the Rh factor and potentially causing harm to future pregnancies.

Option (C) is incorrect as RhoGAM should be administered if the mother is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive. Option (D) is incorrect as RhoGAM administration is recommended at 28 weeks gestation and again after delivery if the baby is Rh-positive."

If the mother is Rh-negative and the baby is Rh-positive (which cannot be determined at this time), there is a risk of developing Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn. RhoGAM is given to prevent the mother from developing antibodies against the Rh antigen and thus prevent Rh hemolytic disease.

If the mother is Rh-positive and the father is Rh-negative, RhoGAM administration is not needed.
