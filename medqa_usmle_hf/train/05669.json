Rupture of the placental vessels can indicate placenta previa but the symptoms suggest placental abruption. Premature rupture of the membranes can cause vaginal bleeding but there is no mention of water in the discharge."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest abruptio placentae, which is the premature separation of the placenta from the uterus. The strong uterine contractions, lower abdominal tenderness, and the almost complete effacement and 2 cm dilation of the cervix all support this diagnosis. Option A (thrombosis of the placental vessels) would present with fetal distress and minimal vaginal bleeding. Option C (rupture of the placental vessels) would present with painless vaginal bleeding. Option D (premature rupture of membranes) would present with clear or straw-colored fluid, not bloody discharge."

The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with placental abruption, which is characterized by painful vaginal bleeding, uterine contractions, and fetal distress. Option B, abrupt constriction of maternal and placental vessels, is the most likely cause of placental abruption. Thrombosis of the placental vessels is more commonly associated with fetal distress, and rupture of the placental vessels would result in painless vaginal bleeding with possible fetal distress. Premature rupture of the membranes would result in painless vaginal discharge with possible fetal distress."
