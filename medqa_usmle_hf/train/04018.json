Among the options, (D) is the correct answer as it explains the cause of the condition - the failure of the invagination and rupture of the dorsal portion of the cloacal membrane. Option (A) is incorrect as the sensory innervation of the lower genital tract occurs before week 12 of intrauterine development. Option (B) is incorrect as there is no known association between the presence of an associated perineal or vestibular fistula and trisomy 21. Option (C) is incorrect as it refers to the condition known as persistent cloaca, which is different from vestibular fistula."

According to the article, vestibular fistula is caused by a failure of the dorsal portion of the cloacal membrane to invaginate and rupture, resulting in a communication between the rectum and the vestibule. Option A is incorrect because anorectal malformations form between weeks 4 and 7. Option B is incorrect because trisomy 21 is not associated with an increased risk of anorectal malformations. Option C is incorrect because anorectal malformations are caused by the abnormal partitioning of the cloaca, not the failure of its division."

Option B is also incorrect as there is no known association between the presence of a perineal or vestibular fistula and trisomy 21. Option C is incorrect as failure of the division of the embryonic cloaca results in a persistent cloaca, where the rectum, bladder, and reproductive system share a single opening."

Option A is incorrect because anomalies of this type occur within the first few weeks of development. Option B is incorrect because there is no known association between trisomy 21 and vestibular fistula. Option C is incorrect because there is no failure of urogenital sinus and rectoanal canal division seen in this condition."
