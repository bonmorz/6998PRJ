The presence of a pulmonary nodule that is dense and irregularly calcified raises suspicion for lung cancer, especially with a significant smoking history.

If the nodule is new, then a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest can help further evaluate the size and characteristics of the nodule. Sputum cytology and flexible bronchoscopy with biopsy may also be considered to obtain a tissue diagnosis."

Before performing invasive procedures, the most appropriate step is to try to obtain previous chest radiographs for comparison to assess for any changes in the nodule over time.

Obtaining a contrast-enhanced CT scan, sending sputum for cytology, and performing a flexible bronchoscopy with biopsy may be considered after comparing the prior chest radiographs."
