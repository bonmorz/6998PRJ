The symptoms suggest a tension pneumothorax, which occurs when air enters the pleural space during inspiration but cannot escape during expiration, resulting in increased pressure and compression of the mediastinum. A partially occlusive dressing should be applied rapidly to the wound to prevent air from entering the pleural space on inspiration. Emergency pericardiocentesis is not an appropriate treatment for pneumothorax. Emergency echocardiography may help diagnose a cardiac injury but does not address the tension pneumothorax. Supplemental oxygen may increase the amount of air entering the pleural space and worsen the situation."

To manage this, a partially occlusive dressing should be applied to the wound to allow air to escape without allowing air to re-enter the pleural space. This will relieve the pressure and allow the lung to re-expand. Emergency pericardiocentesis and emergency echocardiography would be more relevant in the case of cardiac tamponade, which is not indicated by the presented symptoms. Supplemental oxygen may be helpful, but treating the tension pneumothorax should be the primary consideration."

The soldier is likely experiencing a tension pneumothorax, which is characterized by decreased breath sounds, hyperresonance to percussion, and tracheal shift.
