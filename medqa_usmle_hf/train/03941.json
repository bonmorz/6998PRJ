The decreased breath sounds over the left base, palpable crepitus, and laboratory findings suggest a possible mediastinal hematoma. CT scan of the chest is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis of aortic pathology, including aortic dissection or mediastinal hematoma. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy may be considered in the evaluation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, but is not appropriate for this patient. Aortography and transthoracic echocardiography are not preferred in the initial evaluation of possible aortic pathology, as they have limitations in visualizing the extent of the aorta affected by the dissection, and may not be able to detect aortic dissection in its initial stages."
