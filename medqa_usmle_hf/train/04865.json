The high concentration of sarcoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and myoglobin, along with the lack of voltage-gated calcium channels, suggest that the myocytes in this sample have a slower contraction time and rely on aerobic metabolism. This is characteristic of type I (slow-twitch) muscle fibers, which are found in muscles that require sustained activity, such as the postural muscles of the back, including the semispinalis muscle. The ventricular myocardium is composed of a mixture of type I and type II (fast-twitch) muscle fibers, while the lateral rectus muscle and glandular myoepithelium are composed mainly of type II fibers. The staining pattern for ATPase is not specific enough to determine the fiber type."

The description of high concentration of sarcoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and myoglobin, poor ATPase staining, and lack of voltage-gated calcium channels points towards slow-twitch muscle fibers.

Sarcoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and myoglobin are highly concentrated in slow-twitch muscle fibers which are designed for aerobic metabolism. Poor staining for ATPase indicates a low rate of glycolytic metabolism, indicating slow muscle fibers. The lack of voltage-gated calcium channels suggests that these fibers do not rely heavily on calcium-mediated signaling for contraction. Therefore, the site with the greatest concentration of these fibers is likely to be a muscle that is used primarily for sustained or postural activity, such as the Semispinalis muscle."
