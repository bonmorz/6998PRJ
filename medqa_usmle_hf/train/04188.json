The symptoms suggest xeroderma pigmentosum, which is caused by a genetic defect in nucleotide excision repair enzymes, including excision endonucleases. This leads to increased sensitivity to UV radiation and a high risk of developing skin cancer, such as the squamous cell carcinoma in this patient. Rb nuclear protein is implicated in the development of retinoblastoma, but this is not the likely diagnosis in this case. Base-specific glycosylase and DNA helicase are not directly linked to xeroderma pigmentosum."

The symptoms and the biopsy result suggest xeroderma pigmentosum, a genetic disorder that impairs the ability to repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation. The correct answer is Excision endonuclease, as it plays a role in repairing the DNA damage. Rb nuclear protein is related to cell cycle control and is implicated in retinoblastoma. Base-specific glycosylase removes damaged or incorrect nucleotides from DNA. DNA helicase plays a role in DNA replication and repair."
