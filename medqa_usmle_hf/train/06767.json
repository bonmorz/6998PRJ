The patient\u2019s head turning and tilting to the left with minor bruising over the sternocleidomastoid suggests torticollis, which can have different causes, including neck trauma. A neck radiograph can help identify any underlying cervical spine abnormalities that could be contributing to the torticollis. Direct laryngoscopy and referral to ophthalmology are not indicated based on the patient\u2019s symptoms, and physical therapy may be necessary but is not the best next step in management."
