The patient presents with symptoms of viral conjunctivitis, which is self-limiting and often resolves on its own in 1-2 weeks without treatment.

Topical prednisolone acetate is indicated for severe inflammation, but since corneal sensation is normal, it is not necessary at this time. Topical natamycin is used for fungal keratitis, which is not supported by the patient\u2019s symptoms. Topical erythromycin is used for bacterial conjunctivitis, but there is no evidence of a bacterial infection."
