The patient\u2019s past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease put him at high risk for stroke. The presence of visible varicose veins, along with the fact that the patient fell down while gardening, may suggest a possible leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as the source of the stroke. However, the best initial step is to perform an ECG to rule out atrial fibrillation as the cause of the patient\u2019s irregular pulse, which is the leading cause of embolic ischemic stroke. A head CT without contrast can be done later to confirm the stroke and evaluate its size and location. Carotid duplex may be helpful in evaluating possible carotid artery stenosis as a cause of the stroke, but it is not the best initial step in this scenario. Duplex ultrasound of the right leg may be considered if the ECG and head CT are negative, and there is still the suspicion of a leg DVT as a source of the stroke."
