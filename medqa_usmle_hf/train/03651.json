S. saprophyticus is a common cause of urinary tract infections in young, sexually active women. The absence of nitrites in the urinalysis can be explained by the fact that S. saprophyticus does not convert nitrates to nitrites. Additionally, the presence of white blood cells and bacteria in the urine microscopy supports the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection. E. coli is also a common cause of urinary tract infections, but nitrites are usually present in the urinalysis. Acute tubular necrosis and renal calculi would not be the most likely cause of her symptoms or the findings on urine microscopy."
