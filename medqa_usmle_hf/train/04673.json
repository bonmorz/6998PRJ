Therefore, the remaining 50% should come from carbohydrates. The patient needs 20 kcal/kg/day which equals 1000 kcal for his weight. Dividing by 4, one can get the total amount of carbohydrates needed for the patient which is 250g of carbohydrates. A 25% dextrose solution contains 25g/100ml of glucose, so 500ml of 25% dextrose solution should be used to provide the needed carbohydrates."

To calculate the patient\u2019s carbohydrate requirement, we multiply the hypocaloric intake by 50% since the physician wants 50% of the total energy requirement provided by carbohydrates. Therefore, the patient\u2019s carbohydrate requirement is (20 kcal/kg/day x 50 kg) x 0.5 = 500 kcal/day. Because 1 g of dextrose contains 4.0 kcal, the patient\u2019s carbohydrate requirement in grams is 500 kcal/day \u00f7 4.0 kcal/g = 125 g/day. Given that 1 mL of 25% dextrose solution contains 0.25 g of dextrose, the patient requires 125 g/day \u00f7 0.25 g/mL = 500 mL of 25% dextrose solution. Therefore, the most appropriate module is (D) 500 mL of 25% dextrose solution to meet the patient\u2019s carbohydrate requirement over the next 24 hours."

In this case, the total energy requirement is 50 kg x 20 kcal/kg/day = 1000 kcal/day. Twenty percent of this is 200 kcal/day, which is equivalent to 200 kcal/day \u00f7 4 kcal/g = 50 g/day of protein. Thirty percent of the total energy requirement is 300 kcal/day, which is equivalent to 300 kcal/day \u00f7 9 kcal/g = 33.3 g/day of fat. The remaining energy requirement is 500 kcal/day. Subtracting the energy provided by protein and fat yields 500 kcal/day - 200 kcal/day (protein) - 300 kcal/day (fat) = 0 kcal/day. Dividing by the conversion factor of 3.4 kcal/g for carbohydrates gives a carbohydrate requirement of 0 g/day. Since the patient still needs glucose to meet basal metabolic needs, the most appropriate module is a 500 mL of 25% dextrose solution, which provides 125 g of glucose. Option A is suboptimal as it would require a larger volume to meet the carbohydrate requirement, which would worsen fluid balance. Options B and C provide excessive amounts of glucose and can lead to hyperglycemia and other complications."
