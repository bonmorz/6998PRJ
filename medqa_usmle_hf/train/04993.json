The patient is currently taking oxycodone, which is an opioid medication, and requesting a refill at the visit. Therefore, Methadone, a longer-acting opioid medication, would be the best next step in management to address his chronic pain and avoid overprescribing opioids. Supportive therapy, such as hydration and rest, should also be recommended for his acute illness."

The symptoms suggest a viral illness, and since the patient has a history of requesting prescription refills and because his coworkers also presented with similar symptoms, it is important to rule out drug-seeking behavior. Supportive therapy is the best next step in management, but it may also be necessary to address any potential underlying drug abuse issues. Methadone is an effective option for managing chronic pain and opioid addiction, and can be continued while monitoring the patient for any signs of abuse or diversion. Antibiotics like Azithromycin or Metronidazole are not indicated for a viral infection and may lead to unnecessary antibiotic use and associated risks."
