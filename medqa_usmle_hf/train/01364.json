Optic neuropathy is a potential adverse effect of ethambutol, another drug used to treat LTBI. Hyperuricemia and nephrotoxicity are not typically associated with isoniazid."

The fact that the patient has a positive PPD skin test, which is indicative of exposure to tuberculosis, suggests that he is being treated for tuberculosis with a drug that inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acid, such as isoniazid. Liver injury is a potential adverse effect of isoniazid treatment, as it can cause hepatotoxicity. Optic neuropathy is a potential adverse effect of ethambutol, another drug used to treat tuberculosis. Hyperuricemia is a potential adverse effect of pyrazinamide, another drug used to treat tuberculosis. Nephrotoxicity is a potential adverse effect of aminoglycosides, which are not typically used in the treatment of tuberculosis. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) liver injury."
