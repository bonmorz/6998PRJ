They also increase skeletal glycogenolysis and gastrointestinal peristalsis. However, the medication in question is described as a new intravenous medication, which suggests that it is unlikely to affect gastrointestinal peristalsis as it would not be delivered directly to the gastrointestinal tract. Peripheral vasoconstriction is not a common effect of \u03b2-2 receptor agonists. Therefore, the correct answer is bladder detrusor relaxation."
