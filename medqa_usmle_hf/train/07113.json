The symptoms of dizziness, sensation of room spinning, and intermittent ringing and fullness in the ear suggest a disorder of the inner ear, most likely caused by reduced resorption of endolymph, which can result in M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. The horizontal nystagmus to the right suggests a peripheral vestibular disorder. The Weber test lateralization to the left ear and positive Rinne test bilaterally support the diagnosis of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. Occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery or obstruction of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery can cause vestibular symptoms, but these would be sudden and severe, often accompanied by other neurological deficits. A cerebellopontine angle tumor would present with more gradual onset of hearing loss and tinnitus, and would have presented with positive Weber test on the affected side and negative Rinne test on the affected side."

The horizontal nystagmus, lateralization to the left ear on the Weber test, and positive Rinne test are all consistent with this diagnosis. Meniere\u2019s disease is caused by a buildup of endolymph in the inner ear, which results in sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, and tinnitus."

The symptoms, such as dizziness, sensation of room spinning, and intermittent ringing and fullness in her right ear, suggest a condition related to the inner ear. Weber test shows lateralization to the left ear, which indicates that the patient may have hearing loss in the right ear. The positive Rinne test indicates that air conduction is greater than bone conduction, which suggests that there is no conductive hearing loss. Reduced resorption of endolymph can cause Meniere's disease, which is characterized by episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and a feeling of fullness in the ear."

The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is reduced resorption of endolymph, which can lead to a condition called Meniere's disease. This condition can cause episodes of dizziness and vertigo, as well as hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and fullness in the ear. The horizontal nystagmus to the right suggests an inner ear problem, and the Weber test results suggest that the left ear is hearing better than the right, consistent with the patient's report of hearing better on the left, which can be associated with Meniere's disease. The positive Rinne test bilaterally suggests that the patient's hearing loss is conductive rather than sensorineural, which can also be consistent with Meniere's disease. Occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, cerebellopontine angle tumor, and obstruction of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery can all cause similar symptoms to Meniere's disease, but are less likely given the specific findings on examination."

The symptoms of dizziness, sensation of room spinning, and hearing issues on one side suggest a peripheral vestibular disorder, and the horizontal nystagmus to the right and Weber test lateralization to the left ear support this. Among the options, reduced resorption of endolymph is a common cause of peripheral vestibular disorder, also known as Meniere\u2019s disease. Obstruction of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery can lead to vertigo, but there is no indication of this based on the other symptoms and tests. Cerebellopontine angle tumors can also cause hearing loss and vertigo, but the positive Rinne test suggests that the inner ear is not affected."

The symptoms suggest the most likely cause is a disorder of the vestibular system, which controls balance and spatial orientation. The nystagmus and Weber test suggest a peripheral, rather than central, vestibular disorder. The fact that the patient hears better on the left side and has intermittent tinnitus and fullness in the right ear suggest that the disorder is probably in the right inner ear. Reduced resorption of endolymph is a common cause of peripheral vestibular disorders and can lead to conditions such as Meniere's disease. Occlusion or obstruction of cerebellar arteries or cerebellopontine angle tumors are less likely causes."
