In phase 1, lifting a 2.3 kg weight will result in recruitment of motor units with low thresholds, leading to an increase in tension in the biceps muscle. In phase 2, doing 20 burpees will lead to an increase in heart rate and an increase in tension in the myocardium, without recruitment of motor units. In phase 3, electrical stimulation of the gastrocnemius at a frequency of 50 Hz will lead to recruitment of motor units, leading to an increase in tension. Therefore, the answer is (D) Increase of tension in all phases."

In phase 1 of the experiment, the biceps muscle will experience an increase in tension as the weight is lifted off the table, resulting in an increase in electrical activity. In phase 2, the heart muscles will be contracting rapidly, resulting in an increase in tension and electrical activity. In phase 3, electrical stimulation of the gastrocnemius muscle will cause an increase in tension without any change in electrical activity. Therefore, it can be concluded that there will be an increase in tension in all three phases, but the recruitment of motor units and the presence of a fused tetanic contraction will depend on the specific muscle being tested. Option (D) is the correct answer."

In the first phase, when the participant lifts the weight, the biceps muscle will produce tension due to muscle contraction. In the second phase, during the burpees, the heart rate will increase and the cardiac muscle will produce tension to pump blood to meet the metabolic demands. In the third phase, the electrical stimulation will cause the gastrocnemius muscle to produce tension. Therefore, tension will increase in all three phases due to muscle contraction. Option D is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because small motor units are recruited at the start of low-intensity activities and large motor units are recruited in high-intensity activities. Option B is incorrect because small motor units are recruited first, followed by larger units. Option C is incorrect because fused tetanic contraction occurs when the muscle is stimulated with a high frequency, which is not mentioned in the question."

                "content": "We refer to Wikipedia articles on muscle contraction for help. In phase 1, lifting a weight, the biceps muscle will undergo isotonic contraction, with an increase of tension. In phase 2, during the burpees, the heart muscle will undergo rhythmic, coordinated contractions, with an increase of tension. In phase 3, electrical stimulation of the gastrocnemius will result in tetanic contraction, with an increase of tension. Since all three experiments involve muscle contraction, we would expect an increase of tension in all phases. Option A is incorrect because small motor units are typically recruited first followed by larger motor units. Option B is incorrect because once a large motor unit is recruited, smaller units are not typically recruited afterwards. Option C is incorrect because tetanic contraction is a sustained maximal contraction and is not likely to occur in all three phases."

Overall, there will be an increase of tension in all phases, as each phase involves some form of muscular contraction or activity. Option A and B are incorrect as they refer to motor unit recruitment, which may not always be relevant to each specific phase or muscle. Option C is incorrect as it refers specifically to a tetanic contraction, which may not apply to all phases or muscles."

Option (A) is incorrect because recruitment of small motor units occurs during fine movements or low force exertions. Option (B) is incorrect because recruitment of large motor units followed by small motor units occurs during high force exertions. Option (C) is incorrect because only the gastrocnemius muscle in phase 3 will experience tetanic contraction. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Increase of tension in all phases."

In phase 1, the biceps muscle will undergo an isotonic contraction where the tension will remain constant while the muscle shortens. In phase 2, the cardiac muscle will undergo isotonic contraction in synchrony to pump blood out of the heart with no change in tension. In phase 3, the gastrocnemius muscle will undergo an isometric contraction where the tension will increase but the length of the muscle will not change. Overall, there will be an increase in tension in all three phases because all experiments involve muscle activation. Recruitment of motor units refers to the process of activating more muscle fibers as needed and is not the best answer for this question. Fused tetanic contraction is a sustained contraction that occurs when the frequency of muscle stimulation is high and does not apply to these experiments."

The question asks for the expected changes in tension and electrical activity in specific muscles during each phase of the experiment. The answer is (D) Increase of tension in all phases, as all three phases involve muscle contractions that will lead to an increase in tension. The other options given are not supported by the information provided in the question. Option (A) suggests the use of small motor units, but there is no information provided about motor unit recruitment in any of the phases. Option (B) suggests the use of both large and small motor units but again, there is no information provided on motor unit recruitment in any of the phases. Option (C) suggests that fused tetanic contraction occurs at the end of all three phases, but this is not necessarily the case, as not enough information is provided in the question to make this conclusion."
