The pursed-lip breathing, increased anteroposterior diameter, and distant breath sounds suggest emphysema, which is caused by the destruction of lung tissue and a decrease in lung elastic recoil. Work of breathing may be increased in COPD, as well as thickness of small airways, but these are not the most likely parameter to be decreased. Pulmonary vascular pressure may be increased in pulmonary hypertension, which can develop in advanced COPD, but this is not the focus of the patient's symptoms."
