The patient has an A (-) negative blood group and her husband has an O (+) positive blood group, which means their child may have a positive blood type. This puts the patient at risk for developing Rh incompatibility during delivery, which can affect future pregnancies. Anti-RhO(D) immunoglobulin should be administered as soon as possible to prevent this complication. Folic acid is important for prenatal care, but it does not relate to this particular scenario. Vitamin K and Vitamin D are also important for general health, but they do not prevent this potential complication."

The patient has an A (-) negative blood group, while her husband has an O (+) positive blood group, which means that the baby may inherit the Rh-positive blood type from the father. This puts the mother at risk for developing Rh isoimmunization, a condition where the mother develops antibodies against the Rh factor in the baby's blood. This can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn in future pregnancies. Anti-RhO(D) immunoglobulin should be administered immediately to prevent the development of Rh isoimmunization during delivery. Folic acid and vitamin D are important during pregnancy for the development of the fetus, while vitamin K is given to the newborn to prevent bleeding disorders, but none of these options address the specific concern of the patient's blood type and potential for Rh isoimmunization."
