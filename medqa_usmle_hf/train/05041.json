Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate combination works by reducing the volume and work placed on the left ventricle, which could decrease the symptoms of heart failure in the patient. Option A is incorrect as this medication combination has no anti-inflammatory properties. Option B is also incorrect as it does not increase the volume of blood that enters the heart but rather decreases the volume of blood returning to the heart. Option D is partially correct as this medication combination can be beneficial in reducing cardiac remodeling in patients with heart failure, but this is not its primary mechanism of action."
