The patient has symptoms consistent with traveler's diarrhea, which is commonly caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC).

Cereulide is produced by Bacillus cereus and causes vomiting, while Enterotoxin B is produced by Staphylococcus aureus and can cause food poisoning. Shiga toxin is produced by Shigella sp. and can cause bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome."
