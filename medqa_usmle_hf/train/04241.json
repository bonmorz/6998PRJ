Washing the blood products can remove plasma and other substances that may trigger an allergic reaction. Pre-transfusion acetaminophen and diphenhydramine may help reduce fever and prevent allergic reactions, but they are not specific to preventing an allergic reaction to blood transfusions. Administering type-specific blood would be ideal, but it may not always be readily available especially in emergency situations."
