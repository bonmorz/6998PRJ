The impaction of the fetal shoulder caused Erb's palsy, which is a brachial plexus injury commonly involving the upper nerve roots of C5 and C6 spinal nerves. This injury may cause decreased movement of the arm, drooping of the eyelid, and a constricted pupil on the affected side. Therefore, absent unilateral grasp reflex is the most likely finding. Generalized hypotonia, lower back mass, and decreased movement of unilateral rib cage are not associated with Erb's palsy or gestational diabetes mellitus."

The reduced active movement of the left upper extremity might be due to Erb's palsy or brachial plexus injury, caused by the impaction of the fetal shoulder during labor. Therefore, the most likely finding would be an absent unilateral grasp reflex. Generalized hypotonia suggests neuromuscular disorders. A lower back mass suggests spinal cord or neural tube defects.
