The most likely complication from this condition is uveitis, as it is a common extra-intestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease, which can also cause aphthous stomatitis. Deforming arthritis and gastrointestinal ulceration are other potential complications of inflammatory bowel disease, but are less specific to this patient\u2019s current condition. Pulmonary embolism is not associated with aphthous stomatitis."
