The patient\u2019s fear of having colon cancer despite no evidence or symptoms of it suggests Illness anxiety disorder. This disorder was previously known as hypochondriasis and is characterized by excessive fear or preoccupation with having a serious illness despite medical reassurance. The patient\u2019s past history of OCD may contribute to this, as individuals with OCD often have intrusive thoughts related to their health. Malingering would suggest that the patient is intentionally presenting falsified symptoms, which is not the case. Somatic symptoms disorder is characterized by physical symptoms without a clear medical explanation, but fear or preoccupation with having a serious illness is not a defining feature. Generalized anxiety disorder could be a possibility, but the patient\u2019s anxiety appears to be primarily related to health concerns."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, fear of having colon cancer, normal physical examination and laboratory results suggest that the most likely diagnosis is illness anxiety disorder, which is characterized by excessive preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness. The patient\u2019s history of OCD also supports this diagnosis. Malingering is a deliberate fabrication or exaggeration of symptoms for secondary gain, which is not supported by the patient\u2019s history. Somatic symptoms disorder involves persistent physical symptoms that are not fully explained by a medical condition, which is also not supported by the patient\u2019s normal laboratory results. Generalized anxiety disorder involves excessive anxiety and worry about various events and activities, which may contribute to the patient\u2019s presentation but is not the main diagnosis."
