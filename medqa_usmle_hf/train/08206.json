A lump that is firm, painless, and without skin changes, nipple discharge, or axillary adenopathy is less likely to be cancerous. An ultrasound is the most appropriate next step in this case as it is less expensive, less invasive, and less likely to involve radiation exposure compared to a mammogram or magnetic resonance imaging. If the ultrasound shows a suspicious finding, then a biopsy is necessary to confirm or rule out cancer."
