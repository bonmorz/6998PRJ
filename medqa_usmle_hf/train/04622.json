The increased tension in phase 2 is due to the addition of an external weight, which increases the passive tension in the muscle. The shortening of the muscle in phase 1 does use up ATP stores, but this is not the mechanism underlying the higher tension in phase 2. The tension in phase 1 is indeed only active, while in phase 2 it is both active (from the muscle fibers contracting) and passive (from the weight pulling down on the muscle). Shortening the muscle in phase 1 does involve the actin and myosin filaments sliding past each other, but this is not the mechanism underlying the higher tension in phase 2."

However, this tension is only active as there is no external weight or load on the muscle. In phase 2, a weight is attached to the muscle, causing it to lengthen, which increases the passive tension in the muscle. This, combined with the active tension, leads to a higher total tension in phase 2 compared to phase 1. Option A suggests that shortening of the muscle in phase 1 uses up ATP stores, but this is not relevant to the difference in tension between phases 1 and 2. Option C suggests that the tension in phase 1 is only active, while in phase 2 it is both active and passive, which is not entirely accurate as active tension is still present in phase 2. Option D suggests that shortening the muscle in phase 1 pulls the actin and myosin filaments apart, which is a correct statement, but does not explain the difference in tension between the two phases."

The increase in tension seen in phase 2 can be attributed to the increase in passive tension due to the weight added to the muscle tissue. In phase 1, the muscle tissue is being actively shortened, which would utilize ATP stores, but this does not fully explain the difference in tension seen between the phases. Phase 3 serves as a control, and without any manipulation of muscle length, there is no change in tension. Option C is partially correct, as both active and passive tension are present in phase 2, but this alone does not explain the increase in tension. Option D is incorrect, as it describes the mechanism of muscle contraction rather than the difference in tension between the phases."

The increase in tension in phase 2 is due to the increase in passive tension caused by the weight attached to the lower end of the muscle tissue. In phase 1, the tension is only active because the muscle is being shortened, but in phase 2 the tension is both active (created by the muscle contracting) and passive (created by the weight pulling down on the muscle). Option (A) is incorrect because shortening a muscle actually requires energy (ATP) whereas lengthening (option B) is passive. Option (C) is partially correct but doesn't explain the increase in tension seen in phase 2, while option (D) is incorrect because actin and myosin filaments do not get pulled apart during muscle contractions."

This is because the weight stretches the muscle fibers, resulting in increased tension without actively shortening the muscle. In contrast, phase 1 involved actively shortening the muscle, which requires ATP to power muscle contraction. Phase 3 did not involve any manipulation of muscle length and showed no change in tension. Option D is incorrect because pulling the actin and myosin filaments apart would actually decrease tension as they become less engaged with each other. Option C is not entirely accurate as tension in phase 1 is also passive, but it is primarily active due to the muscle actively shortening."

In the second phase, a weight is added, and the muscle is lengthened, which increases the passive tension generated. This is because the additional weight pulls on the muscle fibers, creating more tension even in a relaxed state. Therefore, the mechanism underlying the higher tension in the second phase than in the first phase is the increased passive tension due to the added weight."
