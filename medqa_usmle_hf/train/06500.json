Option (A) might be necessary in severe or complicated cases of mastitis, but it is not indicated in this instance. Option (B) is not recommended as it can cause unnecessary stress on the mother and decrease milk production. Option (D) is not appropriate as untreated mastitis can lead to complications such as abscess formation."
