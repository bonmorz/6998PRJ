The premature newborn has a history of premature birth and presents with respiratory distress, decreased breath sounds bilaterally, and low oxygen saturation. These are all indicative of respiratory distress syndrome, which is common in premature newborns due to lack of surfactant production. Tracheomalacia usually presents with wheezing and inspiratory stridor, which are not present in this case. Neonatal pneumonia may present with respiratory distress, but there is no history or risk factors mentioned for this condition. Tracheoesophageal fistula usually presents with symptoms of feeding difficulty and regurgitation, which are not present in this case."

The newborn\u2019s gestational age and symptoms suggest respiratory distress syndrome, which is caused by a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant in premature infants. The pale extremities and decreased breath sounds bilaterally indicate poor perfusion and ventilation, respectively. The use of supplemental oxygen and the lack of response to increasing oxygen levels also support this diagnosis. Tracheomalacia, neonatal pneumonia, and tracheoesophageal fistula may cause respiratory distress in newborns, but they are less likely based on the clinical presentation."

The symptoms of respiratory distress, such as grunting, subcostal retractions, and decreased breath sounds, are consistent with RDS. The inability to improve oxygen saturation with supplemental oxygen also suggests RDS. Tracheomalacia typically presents later in life and with symptoms such as wheezing and noisy breathing.
