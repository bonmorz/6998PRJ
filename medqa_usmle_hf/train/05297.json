The patient's symptoms, including headache, myalgias, and nausea, along with the high carboxyhemoglobin level, suggest carbon monoxide poisoning. The biochemical results also support this, showing low HCO3- levels and high carboxyhemoglobin levels. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. Essential hypertension is not the cause of the patient's symptoms, and chronic cyanide exposure is not the main cause either, as the patient's serum level is below the reference range. Finally, there is no evidence of viral infection in the patient from the given information."

The elevated blood pressure may be a contributing factor, but essential hypertension is not the main cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms."

The carboxyhemoglobin level confirms this diagnosis. The blood tests show metabolic acidosis due to CO-induced inactivation of cytochrome oxidase, leading to reduced production of ATP and increased anaerobic metabolism. Chronic cyanide exposure can also cause similar symptoms, but the serum cyanide level is low, ruling out this possibility. The patient's hypertension is not the cause of his symptoms. There is no mention of viral infection in the history or examination."

The symptoms described, including headache, myalgias, nausea, irritability, and forgetfulness, are consistent with CO poisoning. The elevated carboxyhemoglobin level supports this diagnosis. The patient's blood tests also show a left shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, which is characteristic of CO poisoning. Chronic cyanide exposure is unlikely as the serum cyanide level is below the normal range. Essential hypertension is also an unlikely cause given the patient's recent onset of symptoms. Viral infection is not a likely cause of this patient's symptoms."
