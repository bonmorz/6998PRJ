An abdominal bruit on the left side and blood pressure of 168/96 mmHg indicate possible renal artery stenosis, and elevated renin levels can be seen in renovascular hypertension. Increased 24-hour urine cortisol is indicative of Cushing's syndrome, which is not supported by other symptoms. Abnormal breathing patterns at night are seen in sleep apnea and are unlikely to be the cause of severe headaches and lightheadedness. Parathyroid adenoma can cause hypercalcemia, but it is not a likely diagnosis given the symptoms and findings described."
