The presence of loose tissue on the floor of the ulcer and deep plantar space involvement suggests the need for sharp surgical debridement of the ulcer. Total contact casting may be used to offload the ulcer and promote healing after debridement, but it is not the initial step in management. Intravenous antibiotic therapy may be added if there is evidence of infection, but it is not the initial step either. Surgical revascularization would only be done if there is evidence of severe peripheral arterial disease, which is not suggested by the intact pedal pulses."

The patient's history of poorly controlled diabetes and the appearance of the ulcer suggest that it may be a diabetic foot ulcer. A possible differential diagnosis is a neuropathic ulcer. The presence of calloused margins and decreased sensation over both feet supports this diagnosis. The initial step in management for a diabetic foot ulcer is sharp surgical debridement of the ulcer to remove any dead tissue and promote healing. Total contact casting, antibiotic therapy, and surgical revascularization may be appropriate interventions, but these can be considered later depending on the patient's response to the initial management."

Based on the history and examination, the most likely diagnosis is diabetic foot ulcer, which is a common complication of poorly controlled diabetes.

Total contact casting may be used later in management to offload pressure on the ulcer, but it is not the initial step. Intravenous antibiotic therapy is not indicated unless there is evidence of infection. Surgical revascularization is not indicated in this case as there is no evidence of arterial insufficiency."

Since the ulcer has been present for 3 months, is on the sole of the foot, and the patient has a history of poorly-controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus, it is most likely a neuropathic foot ulcer. The whitish, loose tissue on the floor of the ulcer also suggests the presence of necrotic tissue that needs to be debrided. Therefore, sharp surgical debridement of the ulcer is the most appropriate initial step in management to remove necrotic tissue and promote healing. Total contact casting may be used later to offload pressure from the foot. Intravenous antibiotics are not indicated at this time, as there is no evidence of infection. Surgical revascularization is not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of peripheral arterial disease."
