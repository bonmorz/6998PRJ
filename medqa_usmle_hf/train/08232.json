Ciguatoxin blocks voltage-gated Na+ channels, which prevents depolarization and alters nerve and muscle function, explaining the patient's tingling sensation and decreased reflexes. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Prevents depolarization of Na+ channels."

This is seen in some types of fish that contain toxins such as tetrodotoxin or saxitoxin."

The symptoms, including tingling sensation in extremities, suggest the most likely cause is ciguatoxin, a toxin found in large reef fish commonly consumed in tropical regions. Ciguatoxin binds to and prevents depolarization of Na+ channels in nerve cells, leading to neurological symptoms. Option A is incorrect as it promotes depolarization, not prevents it. Option C is incorrect as it refers to a different mechanism of action for a different type of toxin. Option D is incorrect as permanent Gs activation is not associated with the symptoms described."

The symptoms in this patient are consistent with paralytic shellfish poisoning, caused by consumption of fish containing saxitoxin. The mechanism of action of saxitoxin is to prevent depolarization of sodium channels, leading to paralysis and respiratory failure. Option A is incorrect as it describes the mechanism of action of tetrodotoxin, which is another toxin commonly found in fish. Option C describes the mechanism of action of superantigens, which are typically associated with bacterial infections. Option D describes a signaling pathway not relevant to this case."
