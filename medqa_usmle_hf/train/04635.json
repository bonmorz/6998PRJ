The patient presents with third-trimester bleeding, which is a concerning symptom that requires careful monitoring of the mother and fetus. The fetal heart rate is reassuring, but the retroplacental hematoma is a risk factor for placental abruption, a potentially life-threatening condition for both mother and fetus. Therefore, the patient should be admitted for maternal and fetal monitoring and observation. Urgent cesarean delivery is reserved for cases where the fetus is in distress or the mother is unstable. Corticosteroid administration is typically used to accelerate fetal lung maturation in cases where preterm delivery is anticipated, but it is not indicated in this scenario. Outpatient management is not appropriate for a patient with such significant symptoms and risk factors."
