The patient's history of swimming in the ocean and the presentation of hemorrhagic blisters and surrounding redness suggest Vibrio vulnificus as the most likely causal organism. The gram-negative bacilli that ferment lactose, seen in blood cultures, also support this diagnosis. Shigella flexneri and Clostridium perfringens can cause infections, but they are not commonly associated with the described presentation after a foot wound. Streptococcus pyogenes is associated with cellulitis and erysipelas, but it is not commonly associated with leg swelling or hemorrhagic blisters."
