The elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level indicates hypothyroidism. Lymphocytic infiltration on fine needle aspiration is most likely to be found in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the most common cause of hypothyroidism in children in the United States. Positive serum thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibody is associated with Graves' disease. Increased uptake on I-131 scan in a discrete 1-cm nodule is associated with thyroid adenoma or hyperfunctioning adenomatous nodules. Low urine iodine levels are associated with iodine-deficiency hypothyroidism."

Slowed growth and fatigue with a nontender mass on anterior cervical examination suggests hypothyroidism, specifically Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Elevation of TSH levels confirms this diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration can confirm the lymphocytic infiltration. Positive serum thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibody is related to Graves' disease, not Hashimoto's. Increased uptake on I-131 scan in a discrete 1-cm nodule is indicative of a functioning thyroid nodule, which is not relevant in this case. Low urine iodine levels are seen in cases of iodine-deficiency hypothyroidism, which is not relevant in this case as the patient does not have a history of decreased iodine intake."

The combination of slowed growth, fatigue, concentration problems, and a nontender mass in the anterior cervical examination suggests an underlying thyroid condition. The elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level indicates hypothyroidism. Fine needle aspiration (option A) would likely show lymphocytic infiltration, a characteristic finding in autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease), the most common cause of hypothyroidism in children. Positive serum thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibody (option B) is a finding in Graves' disease, which is a cause of hyperthyroidism, not hypothyroidism. Increased uptake on I-131 scan in a discrete 1-cm nodule (option C) is suggestive of a hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule or thyroid cancer, also not consistent with the patient's presentation of hypothyroidism. Low urine iodine levels (option D) may suggest iodine deficiency as a cause of hypothyroidism, but the nontender mass already present suggests autoimmune thyroiditis as a more likely explanation."

The girl presents with slowed growth, fatigue, a nontender mass on the anterior cervical exam, and an elevated TSH level, which suggest an underactive thyroid gland or hypothyroidism. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) can be used to obtain cells from the thyroid gland to evaluate for lymphocytic infiltration, which is a common finding in autoimmune hypothyroidism. Positive serum thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies are seen in Grave's disease, which is a cause of hyperthyroidism. Increased uptake on I-131 scan in a discrete 1-cm nodule suggests a thyroid adenoma or hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule, which is not typical in hypothyroidism. Low urine iodine levels can be seen in iodine deficiency, but this is less likely in a patient who has not had any change in appetite or diet."
