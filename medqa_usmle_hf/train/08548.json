The patient had a surgical resection of the terminal ileum, which can lead to malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin E. Vitamin E deficiency can cause neurological symptoms including weakness and ataxia, so option (A) is the correct answer. Hyperreflexia with tetany would be seen in hypocalcemia, pallor with koilonychia would be seen in iron deficiency anemia, and dry skin with keratomalacia would be seen in vitamin A deficiency. None of these are directly related to the patient's history of Crohn's disease and surgical resection."
