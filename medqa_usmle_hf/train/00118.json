The patient suffered from abdominal trauma, and the abdominal exam reveals rigidity and tenderness, which suggest that internal organs may have been affected. An ultrasound is the best initial test for evaluating this patient as it is non-invasive and can quickly identify any fluid accumulation or damage to organs. Peritoneal lavage and CT scan are also options, but they require more time and resources. Diagnostic laparotomy is an invasive option and should only be considered if other tests are inconclusive."
