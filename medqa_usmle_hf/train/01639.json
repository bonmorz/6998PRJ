The antibiotic given targets the 50S ribosome, which is consistent with Gram-positive bacteria. The onset of abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea suggests the superinfection of Clostridium difficile, which is a Gram-positive bacillus known to cause antibiotic-associated diarrhea."

The symptoms of abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea suggest that the patient is experiencing Clostridium difficile infection due to the use of antibiotics. The clue to the correct answer lies in the fact that the patient was treated with an antibiotic that targets the 50S ribosome, which could be macrolides, lincosamides, and ketolides. Clostridium difficile is known to cause antibiotic-related diarrhea and is a Gram-positive bacillus, making option (D) the correct answer."

The patient presents with symptoms of an infected injection site and is started on an antibiotic that targets the 50S ribosome, which suggests that the antibiotic is a macrolide such as azithromycin or clarithromycin. Five days later, he develops abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea, which are symptoms of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, a common complication of antibiotic use. Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive bacillus, making option (D) the correct answer. The other options are unlikely to cause these symptoms in this patient."

The patient's recent travel and the antibiotic that targets the 50S ribosome suggest that the patient has developed Clostridium difficile infection, which is most commonly associated with antibiotic use. Among the options, only Gram-positive bacillus includes Clostridium difficile. Gram-negative curved bacillus is Vibrio cholerae, which causes watery diarrhea but is typically associated with contaminated food or water, not healthcare-associated infections. Gram-negative bacillus includes various bacteria, such as E. coli and Salmonella, but they do not cause abdominal cramps and diarrhea immediately after drainage of the abscess. Gram-positive coccus includes Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, but Clostridium difficile is not classified as either."
