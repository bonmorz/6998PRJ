A respiratory quotient of 0.8 suggests that the patient is burning more carbohydrates than fat.

Option (B) satisfies this condition."

An RQ of 0.8 indicates that the patient is metabolizing a higher amount of carbohydrates and a lower amount of fats. To decrease the patient's respiratory quotient, there should be a decrease in carbohydrate intake and an increase in fat intake, as seen in option (B). This will promote fat metabolism, which produces less CO2 than carbohydrate metabolism. The other options will not help decrease the patient's respiratory quotient."
