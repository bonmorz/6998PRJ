Autoimmune attack on the thyroid gland, known as Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, is a common cause of hypothyroidism. Chronic blood loss may lead to iron deficiency anemia but does not account for the entire constellation of symptoms. Iatrogenesis refers to illness caused by medical treatment, which is not applicable in this scenario. Nutritional deficiencies may cause specific symptoms, but do not explain the combination of fatigue, weight gain, and constipation seen in this patient."

The lack of other significant findings and normal CBC suggest that the problem may be autoimmune in nature, with an attack on the thyroid tissue leading to decreased thyroid hormone production. Autoimmune thyroiditis (also known as Hashimoto's thyroiditis) can cause hypothyroidism, and is the most likely cause in this case. Chronic blood loss or nutritional deficiency may lead to anemia, which would present with different symptoms. Iatrogenesis refers to harm caused by medical treatment or procedures, and is not relevant to this patient's presentation."

The patient's symptoms suggest hypothyroidism, which is often caused by autoimmune thyroiditis involving an autoimmune attack on endocrine tissue. In addition to fatigue, constipation, and weight gain, hypothyroidism can cause dry skin and bradycardia, which are consistent with the patient's symptoms and vital signs. Chronic blood loss can lead to iron deficiency anemia, which can cause fatigue, but the CBC is normal in this patient. Iatrogenesis suggests that the condition was caused by medical treatment, which is not applicable in this case based on the information provided. Nutritional deficiency is a possible cause of fatigue, but the patient does not report any dietary changes, and there is no evidence of malnutrition in the question stem."
