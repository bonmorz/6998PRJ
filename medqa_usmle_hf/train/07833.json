The patient presents with pain and limited range of motion in his right shoulder, with tenderness to palpation on the anterolateral aspect of the shoulder. The MRI reveals increased signals in the rotator cuff tendon, which is indicative of rotator cuff tendinopathy. Conservative measures (rest and ice) alone may not be enough to alleviate the symptoms. NSAIDs are effective in reducing pain and inflammation, and can be used in conjunction with conservative measures to improve the patient\u2019s symptoms. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection can also be considered, but is typically reserved for cases that do not respond to NSAIDs and conservative measures. Acromioplasty is a surgical procedure that is only considered in cases of severe or chronic rotator cuff tendinopathy that do not respond to non-surgical measures."
