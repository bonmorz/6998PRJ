Among the options, only colchicine decreases microtubule polymerization, which helps reduce the inflammatory response in gout. Option (A) is the mechanism of action of allopurinol, which inhibits uric acid production, and option (B) is the mechanism of action of probenecid, which increases uric acid excretion by inhibiting its reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule. Option (C) is the mechanism of action of glucocorticoids, which have anti-inflammatory effects but are not the treatment of choice for acute gout attacks."

Colchicine is used to treat the inflammation associated with gout by inhibiting microtubule polymerization, which prevents the migration of leukocytes to the affected site. A is incorrect because xanthine oxidase inhibitors are used to prevent gout attacks by reducing uric acid production. B is incorrect because drugs like probenecid are used to increase the excretion of uric acid by inhibiting its reabsorption. C is incorrect because colchicine does not affect glucocorticoid receptors."

The figure provided in the question shows classic symptoms of gout, and colchicine is a medication used to treat acute gout attacks. Its mechanism of action is to decrease microtubule polymerization, thereby reducing inflammatory responses. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase (option A) is the mechanism of action for medications such as allopurinol and febuxostat used for chronic management of gout. Option B (inhibition of uric acid reabsorption) is the mechanism of action for medications such as probenecid also used for chronic management of gout. Option C (binding to glucocorticoid receptor) is the mechanism of action for glucocorticoids used for anti-inflammatory purposes, but not specifically for gout."
