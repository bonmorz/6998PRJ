The patient's history and physical examination suggest pericarditis, which is characterized by chest pain that worsens with inspiration and is relieved by leaning forward. This condition is also associated with a scratching sound (pericardial friction rub) that can be heard on physical examination. The ECG finding most commonly associated with pericarditis is diffuse, concave ST-segment elevations. Therefore, the correct answer is (B). S waves in lead I, Q waves in lead III, and inverted T waves in lead III (option A) are seen in acute posterior myocardial infarction. The sawtooth appearance of P waves (option C) is consistent with atrial flutter. Peaked T waves and ST-segment elevations in leads V1-V6 (option D) are consistent with hyperkalemia."

The patient is a 64-year-old female with chest pain described as sharp, worse with deep breaths, and a scratching sound heard over the left sternal border. The patient also has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and is taking methotrexate. These findings are suggestive of pericarditis. Diffuse, concave ST-segment elevations are a common finding in pericarditis, and therefore option (B) is the correct answer. Option (A) describes findings seen in inferior wall myocardial infarction, which is not suggested in the patient's history or physical exam. Option (C) describes findings seen in atrial flutter, which is not likely to cause chest pain in this patient. Option (D) describes findings seen in hyperkalemia, which is also not suggested by the patient's history or physical exam."
