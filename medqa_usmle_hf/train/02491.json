Tricyclic antidepressants can cause serotonin syndrome if used in combination with other serotonergic drugs, or if the dose is too high. Therefore, it would be important to advise the patient to inform her healthcare provider of all medications she is taking and to watch out for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome such as confusion, fever, seizures, and muscle stiffness. Option B (agranulocytosis) and option C (lowering of seizure threshold) are potential side effects of tricyclic antidepressants but are less relevant to this patient and her presenting symptoms. Option D (rare lethality at high doses) is not a relevant safety concern for this patient as long as she is taking the medication as prescribed."
