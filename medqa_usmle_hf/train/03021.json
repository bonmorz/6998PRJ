The patient\u2019s elevated blood pressure, lack of significant findings on physical examination, and normal laboratory results suggest the need for further evaluation of potential underlying cardiac causes. The most appropriate first step in this evaluation is an electrocardiogram. Polysomnography is used to evaluate sleep disorders, echocardiography is used to evaluate cardiac function, and renal ultrasonography is used to evaluate renal causes of hypertension. None of these tests are the initial recommended step in the patient\u2019s management."

The patient has hypertension without any other symptoms, and there are no abnormalities in the physical examination or laboratory tests.

Echocardiography and renal ultrasonography may be appropriate eventually, but an ECG should be done first."
