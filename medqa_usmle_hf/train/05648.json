The description of the episode suggests a focal seizure, as there was a sudden onset of violent jerky movements of the right arm, sweating, and weakness afterward. Sydenham chorea is more gradual and has a longer duration. Sporadic transient tic disorder is not associated with the sweating or weakness, and hemiplegic migraine usually has a headache component. The history of a previous episode with fever also supports the diagnosis of an epileptic seizure."

The symptoms suggest a focal seizure, as the patient experienced weakness in the right arm and was not able to lift it above his head for 2 hours after the episode. Sydenham chorea is associated with rheumatic fever and would show abnormal movements on examination. Sporadic transient tic disorder does not typically present with sweating or weakness. Hemiplegic migraine would show abnormal neurologic findings on examination."

The symptoms suggest a focal seizure, which is characterized by sudden, abnormal, involuntary motor activity or behavior that is localized to a specific area of the body. The history of a previous episode of jerky movements with a high-grade fever in childhood suggests a possible febrile seizure. Sydenham chorea would have more generalized and continuous movements, and sporadic transient tic disorder and hemiplegic migraine don't fully match the presented symptoms."

The symptoms, including the sudden onset of violent, jerky movements and weakness in the right arm, suggest that the most likely diagnosis is focal seizure.

Sydenham chorea is associated with rheumatic fever and typically presents with motor tics and emotional lability. Sporadic transient tic disorder is characterized by sudden, brief, and repetitive movements or vocalizations, without loss of consciousness. Hemiplegic migraine typically presents with severe headaches, often accompanied by sensory or motor disturbances on one side of the body."
