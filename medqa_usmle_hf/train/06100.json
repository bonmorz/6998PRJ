The patient\u2019s BMI in the morbid obesity range, enlarged uvula and the lack of septal deviation or polyps suggest obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome. However, the PCO2 of 51 mm Hg during REM sleep and arterial blood gas analysis showing elevated PCO2 and HCO3\u2212 without hypoxemia suggest obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Central hypoventilation syndrome would show decreased PCO2 due to compensation. Therefore, (B) Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is the best explanation for these findings."

The arterial blood gas analysis also shows an elevated PCO2 and normal or low PO2, which are characteristic of this syndrome. Option A is incorrect because the apnea-hypopnea index is very low. Option C is unlikely given the absence of neurologic symptoms. Option D is incorrect as it suggests a combination of two different conditions."

Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome would show a higher apnea-hypopnea index, while central hypoventilation syndrome would show hypoventilation during both REM and non-REM sleep.
