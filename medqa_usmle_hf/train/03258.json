The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest a possible peptic ulcer, which can be exacerbated by ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Switching to acetaminophen, which is not an NSAID, would be a more appropriate pain reliever for this patient. Omeprazole and ranitidine can help treat peptic ulcers but switching to a proton pump inhibitor or H2 blocker alone may not be sufficient, especially if the patient continues to use ibuprofen. Aspirin also belongs to the NSAID class and can also exacerbate peptic ulcers."
