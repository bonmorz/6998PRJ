According to the American Cancer Society guidelines, individuals with a family history of CRC should begin screening either at age 40 or 10 years earlier than the age at which the youngest affected relative was diagnosed. However, in this case, the patient's family history is particularly concerning and warrants more aggressive screening starting at age 25 with colonoscopy every 1-2 years.
