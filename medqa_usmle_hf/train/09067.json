The patient's recent travel to South Asia and symptoms of jaundice, nausea, and vomiting suggest that the most likely cause of her condition is Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection. Anti-HEV IgM would be the appropriate serum study to test for acute HEV infection. HBsAg is associated with Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Anti-HCV IgG with Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Anti-HAV IgM with Hepatitis A virus (HAV). Though jaundice can be caused by any of these viruses, the patient's recent travel to South Asia and clinical presentation make HEV the most likely cause."

HBsAg will be positive in chronic hepatitis B, but the patient's immunizations are up-to-date, so it's less likely. Anti-HCV IgG will be positive in chronic hepatitis C, which is less common than HEV in South Asia. Anti-HAV IgM will be increased in acute hepatitis A, but it is less common in South Asia than HEV."
