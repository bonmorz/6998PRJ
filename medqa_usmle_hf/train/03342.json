The presence of pleural effusions with the low glucose level and lymphocytic leukocytosis suggests tuberculosis. Rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol are the recommended treatment for tuberculosis. Azithromycin and ceftriaxone are recommended for community-acquired pneumonia, but the fluid analysis does not support this diagnosis. Azithromycin and vancomycin may be used for hospital-acquired pneumonia, but again, the fluid analysis does not support this diagnosis. Furosemide is a diuretic and would not be indicated in this scenario."

The findings of bilateral pleural effusions, low glucose, and lymphocytic leukocytosis in pleural fluid further support this suspicion. The next best step in management would be to start treatment with a four-drug regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for tuberculosis. The other options are not appropriate for the management of tuberculosis. Azithromycin and ceftriaxone are the preferred antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia, while vancomycin is used for suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Furosemide may be used to manage pleural effusions, but it is not appropriate in this case given the suspected diagnosis of tuberculosis."
