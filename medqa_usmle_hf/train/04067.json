A complete blood count with differential is the most important diagnostic study at this time to check for leukocytosis, neutrophilia, or lymphopenia, which could indicate an infection. Thyroid-stimulating hormone is not necessary at this time, as the patient was recently diagnosed with Graves\u2019 disease and is being treated with PTU. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is not specific enough for this presentation. No further testing is not indicated as the patient has symptoms and a new ulcer that need further evaluation."
