Smoking and alcohol consumption have both been linked to an increased risk of birth defects, so decreasing alcohol consumption would be helpful. However, the most effective option for decreasing congenital malformations is folic acid supplementation, as multiple studies have shown its effectiveness in reducing the risk."

Folic acid supplementation is recommended for all women of reproductive age, and especially for those with risk factors such as a history of seizures and medication use, as it can decrease the risk of neural tube defects and other congenital abnormalities in the developing fetus. Alcohol consumption should also be avoided during pregnancy, but it is not the best answer in this case as there is no indication that the patient is currently drinking heavily or planning to continue drinking during pregnancy. Switching to another antiepileptic medication may be necessary in some cases to minimize the risk of harm to the developing fetus, but this is a complex decision that should be made in consultation with a neurologist or other specialist. Switching to cephalexin is not indicated in this case as it is an antibiotic and has no known impact on congenital malformations in the developing fetus."
