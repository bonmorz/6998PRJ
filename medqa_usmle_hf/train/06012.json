The chronic shoulder pain may be a trigger for the headache. Indomethacin is used to treat cluster headaches but the patient is still experiencing pain. Migraine headaches usually do not present with drooping eyelid or tearing eye. Giant cell arteritis typically presents with headache and scalp tenderness, and it is rare in a patient this young. Medication overuse headache is unlikely as the patient has been using indomethacin as prescribed."

Drooping of the right eyelid, tearing of the right eye, and rhinorrhea are additional symptoms of cluster headache. Chronic shoulder pain and smoking history may be contributing factors. Indomethacin is ineffective for cluster headaches. Migraine headache usually involves nausea or vomiting, and vision disturbance, while giant cell arteritis typically affects older adults and causes scalp pain and jaw claudication. Medication overuse headache usually occurs in patients with a history of frequent use of pain medications or caffeine."

Indomethacin is not effective in treating cluster headaches, and the patient's history, including chronic shoulder pain and smoking, are also consistent with the diagnosis. Migraine headache typically presents with unilateral throbbing pain, visual changes or photophobia, and is relieved by lying down in a dark and quiet room. Giant cell arteritis affects elderly patients, and can present as headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, and visual disturbances. Medication overuse headache typically presents with daily or near-daily headaches that develop or worsen during or after the overuse of medication."
