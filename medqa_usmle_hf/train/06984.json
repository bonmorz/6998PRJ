Given the patient's age, breastfeeding, and adequate urine and stool output, physiological jaundice is the likely cause of the jaundice.

Reassurance and advice to continue breastfeeding are appropriate at this time. Phenobarbitol and exchange transfusions are used for more severe cases of jaundice."

The patient has physiological jaundice, which is common in newborns and is caused by the immature liver's inability to breakdown bilirubin efficiently. The bilirubin levels are not high enough to warrant any intervention, and the most appropriate action is to reassure the mother that jaundice is a common condition in newborns that will resolve on its own as the liver matures. Continuing breastfeeding is also important as it can help increase the rate of bilirubin excretion. Option (B) phototherapy is used if the bilirubin levels are significantly high, usually >15 mg/dL, and are causing significant clinical symptoms. Option (C) exchange transfusion is used in severe cases of hyperbilirubinemia and carries a risk of complications, so it is not appropriate in this case. Option (A) phenobarbital can help increase the rate of bilirubin metabolism but is not indicated in this scenario as the bilirubin levels are not high enough to warrant intervention."

Reassuring the mother and encouraging her to continue breastfeeding can help promote bowel movements and decrease bilirubin levels.
