Ovarian cyst and PID may present with similar symptoms, but the physical findings in this case suggest Endometriosis as the most likely diagnosis. Diverticulitis typically presents with lower abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits."

The left adnexal mass is also suggestive of endometriosis. Ovarian cysts usually do not cause the patient's constellation of symptoms, and diverticulitis is a condition of the large intestine. PID could cause lower pelvic pain, but it is rare to have nodules during rectovaginal examination with PID."

The left adnexal mass and nodules found during the rectovaginal exam also support this diagnosis. Ovarian cysts may cause similar symptoms, but they usually do not cause nodules during a rectovaginal exam, and tenderness is usually prominent on one side of the abdomen rather than generalized. Diverticulitis is unlikely as the tenderness is not localized to the left lower abdomen only, and there are no symptoms of diarrhea or fever. PID is also unlikely given the absence of specific signs such as cervical motion tenderness or fever."
