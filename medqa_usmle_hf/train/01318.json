The symptoms of a sandpaper rash, red tongue, and elevated antistreptolysin O levels suggest a streptococcal infection, which can trigger acute rheumatic fever. Acute rheumatic fever is mediated by antibodies against streptococcal M protein, which can cross-react with cardiac and joint antigens and lead to inflammation. The involvement of complement and the presence of proteinuria suggest a systemic immune reaction, which can also be seen in polyarteritis nodosa and rheumatoid arthritis. However, Arthus reaction is a localized immune reaction and myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction, so they are not triggered by a similar mechanism as acute rheumatic fever. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) I, IV, V."
