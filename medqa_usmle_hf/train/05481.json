The finding of mild swelling around the left eye and limited extraocular movement indicates involvement of the oculomotor nerve. The corneal reflex also involves the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, which can be affected if the infection spreads, leading to an absent corneal reflex. Jaw deviation and hypoesthesia of the earlobe are not related to this condition, and hemifacial anhidrosis is associated with damage to the sympathetic ganglia, which is not likely in this case."
