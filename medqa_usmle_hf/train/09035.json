The symptoms of tiredness, weakness, and numbness of lower limbs indicate a possible vitamin B12 deficiency, which is common in strict vegans who do not take any supplements. A smooth, red beefy tongue along with neurological impairment, such as lower extremity sensory and motor deficits, suggests pernicious anemia, which is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. Ataxia is a common neurological symptom associated with pernicious anemia."
