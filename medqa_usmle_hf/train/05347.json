The symptoms, including the pain around the eye, pupillary dilation, optic disk swelling, and decreased color vision, suggest optic neuritis which is a common early symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is confirmed by the MRI findings. Methylprednisolone is the standard treatment for acute optic neuritis in MS. Carbamazepine is used in epilepsy and trigeminal neuralgia. IVIG and plasma exchange are used in the treatment of certain autoimmune disorders but not for MS-related optic neuritis."
