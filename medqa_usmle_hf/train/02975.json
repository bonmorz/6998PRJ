The patient presents with symptoms of postpartum preeclampsia and underwent a C-section, suggesting a high risk for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Blurry vision and inability to lactate suggest pituitary involvement, and a low prolactin level is consistent with hypopituitarism. Brain MRI is the most appropriate next step to evaluate for PRES and pituitary involvement."

Given the patient's history of hypertension and symptoms of headache and blurry vision, as well as the large-volume blood loss during the Caesarian section, it is likely that the patient suffered from postpartum eclampsia. The subsequent development of a low prolactin level suggests damage to the pituitary gland, which can occur in severe cases of eclampsia. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be a brain MRI to assess for pituitary damage. Observation of maternal-child interactions or breast ultrasound would not be relevant in this case, and a head CT is less sensitive than an MRI for detecting pituitary damage."
