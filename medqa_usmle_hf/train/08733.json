Radiograph B shows a pattern of diffuse abdominal haziness, which is consistent with intra-abdominal bleeding. Radiograph C shows free air under the diaphragm, which is suggestive of a perforated viscous, but this is less likely given the patient's presentation. Radiograph D shows a distended bowel loop, which could be present in cases of bowel obstruction, but is less likely given the patient's history. Radiograph E shows a large pneumothorax, which is not consistent with the patient's primary complaints and is unrelated to intra-abdominal bleeding."
