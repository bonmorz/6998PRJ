The activation of M2-cholinergic receptors can lead to bradycardia and AV block, which are seen in this patient. Inhibition of beta-adrenergic receptors can lead to tachycardia, while activation of M1-cholinergic receptors and inhibition of M2-cholinergic receptors can cause other symptoms but not the cardiac manifestations seen in this patient."
