The patient presents with fever, abdominal pain, and cervical motion tenderness, which are all symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Urinary tract infection can cause fever but usually does not cause lower abdominal pain and cervical motion tenderness. Vaginitis and cervicitis do not typically cause severe lower abdominal pain and adnexal tenderness, and the purulent discharge suggests a deeper infection such as PID. The negative urine pregnancy test also rules out ectopic pregnancy as a cause of the symptoms."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) which is characterized by inflammation of the upper genital tract. The positive cervical motion tenderness and inflamed cervix support this diagnosis. Vaginitis and cervicitis are less likely to cause diffuse lower abdominal pain and adnexal tenderness. A negative urine pregnancy test excludes ectopic pregnancy, but a more specific test for pregnancy (such as serum beta-hCG) should be considered as well. Urinary tract infections typically do not cause cervical motion tenderness or uterine tenderness."
