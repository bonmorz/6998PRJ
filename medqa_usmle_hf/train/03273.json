This disorder is characterized by a preoccupation with physical symptoms and excessive worry about their significance. There is no evidence that the patient is intentionally deceiving or faking her symptoms, which would suggest malingering or factitious disorder. Conversion disorder involves neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by medical pathology, and illness anxiety disorder (previously known as hypochondriasis) involves excessive worry about having a serious illness despite little or no evidence of it. Somatic symptom disorder is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient."
