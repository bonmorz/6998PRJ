The sudden onset of chest pain, cough, and shortness of breath, along with decreased breath sounds and translucency on chest radiography, suggest a pneumothorax. The fact that it is sudden and not related to a known medical condition rules out COPD and asthma as causes. Tension pneumothorax would also cause a more obvious mediastinal shift visible on imaging, making spontaneous pneumothorax the most likely option. The elevated pCO2 and decreased pO2 are likely due to the decreased lung function caused by the pneumothorax."
