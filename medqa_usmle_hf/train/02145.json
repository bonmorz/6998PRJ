The patient's symptoms are suggestive of a bowel obstruction, as evidenced by the distention and high-pitched bowel sounds. The x-ray confirms the presence of gas-filled loops of bowel consistent with obstruction. The most appropriate next step in management is nasogastric tube placement for decompression and bowel rest. Antibiotics and surgical intervention may be necessary if there is evidence of perforation or ischemia, but those are not indicated at this time. Colonoscopy may be performed later for evaluation of the patient's history of constipation and family history of colorectal cancer, but it is not indicated in the acute management of his current symptoms."
