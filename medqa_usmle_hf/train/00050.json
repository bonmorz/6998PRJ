The symptoms of a fussy baby who is not feeding well, gaining weight, and having a distended abdomen suggest Hirschsprung disease. This disease is caused by the failure of specialized cells to migrate, leading to a lack of ganglion cells in the rectum and colon, resulting in constipation and abdominal distension. Meckel diverticulum is a congenital abnormality where a portion of the intestine protrudes into the umbilicus. DiGeorge syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the thymus and parathyroid glands. Duodenal atresia is a blockage in the first part of the small intestine, leading to vomiting and abdominal distension."
