The bilateral papilledema and suprasellar calcifications on CT scan indicate craniopharyngioma, a rare type of brain tumor that can affect hormone production and cause weight gain. Primary hypothyroidism could also cause weight gain, but the low TSH levels and free T4 levels suggest otherwise. Optic nerve atrophy would not explain the other symptoms, and pituitary adenoma would not cause suprasellar calcifications."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including headaches, visual changes, weight gain, and bilateral papilledema, suggest increased intracranial pressure. The presence of suprasellar calcifications on CT scan points to a craniopharyngioma, which can cause hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction, leading to weight gain and endocrine abnormalities. Primary hypothyroidism can cause weight gain and fatigue, but it is unlikely to cause papilledema and visual changes. Optic nerve atrophy may cause visual changes, but it does not explain the patient\u2019s other symptoms. Pituitary adenoma can cause endocrine abnormalities, but it does not explain the elevated intracranial pressure and papilledema."

The patient presents with symptoms of headache, diplopia, and progressively diminishing peripheral vision, which suggests increased intracranial pressure due to a mass lesion. The presence of bilateral papilledema and slow deep tendon reflexes further supports this diagnosis. The suprasellar calcifications on CT scan are suggestive of craniopharyngioma. The laboratory values are also consistent with this diagnosis, as it is known to cause hypothyroidism and hyponatremia.

The patient has symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (persistent headaches, diplopia, and papilledema), weight gain despite trying to control diet and exercise, and laboratory findings of low TSH and Free T4 levels, suggesting hypopituitarism. The suprasellar calcification seen on CT scan is typical of craniopharyngioma, a slow-growing benign tumor located near the pituitary gland. Primary hypothyroidism can cause low TSH and Free T4 levels, but it does not explain the other symptoms. Optic nerve atrophy would not cause the other symptoms. Pituitary adenoma is a possible differential diagnosis, but the presence of suprasellar calcifications is more typical of craniopharyngioma."

The patient's symptoms, including headache, diplopia, and diminishing peripheral vision, are consistent with a craniopharyngioma, which is a tumor that occurs near the pituitary gland. The pedal edema and slow deep tendon reflexes may be related to the hypersecretion of antidiuretic hormone caused by the tumor. The suprasellar calcifications seen on CT scan are also consistent with a craniopharyngioma. The low TSH and free T4 suggest some degree of secondary hypothyroidism, which can occur with pituitary tumors. However, given the other symptoms and imaging findings, craniopharyngioma is the more likely diagnosis."

The patient presents with a headache, diplopia, peripheral vision loss, difficulty losing weight, and bilateral papilledema, which are all signs of increased intracranial pressure. The suprasellar calcifications and laboratory studies indicating low thyroid hormone levels and normal TSH levels suggest the most probable diagnosis of craniopharyngioma. Pituitary adenomas can also cause similar symptoms, but the suprasellar calcifications differentiate them from craniopharyngiomas. Optic nerve atrophy would not cause the complete set of symptoms presented by the patient. Primary hypothyroidism does not explain the other symptoms such as headache and peripheral vision loss."
