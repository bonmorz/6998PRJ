The patient is overweight, has a family history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and has abnormal lipid and glucose levels. The most appropriate next step in management would be to start with a reduced-calorie diet to promote weight loss before considering medication therapy.

Metformin therapy is typically used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, which the patient has not been diagnosed with."
