It is appropriate to reassure the patient and potentially monitor the mass with follow-up mammography. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and modified radical mastectomy are not indicated without a definitive diagnosis of cancer. Wide excision of the lump may be considered if the mass grows or changes over time, but reassurance and monitoring are the most appropriate next steps."

The irregular mass with microcalcifications and oil cysts, along with the patient\u2019s risk factors, suggest the possibility of a cancer diagnosis. However, the foam cells and multinucleated giant cells on core biopsy, along with the fact that it has only been 10 days since the patient noticed the mass, suggest a benign cause. Therefore, reassurance and monitoring with clinical and imaging evaluations over time are the most appropriate next steps in management. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, modified radical mastectomy, and wide excision of the lump are all too invasive or aggressive for this stage of diagnosis."
