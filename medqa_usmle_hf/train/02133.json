The photograph of the face shows multiple facial angiofibromas, which are a characteristic finding in patients with tuberous sclerosis. Tuberous sclerosis increases the risk of developing renal angiomyolipoma, but the patient's weight is within normal limits which lowers the likelihood of renal angiomyolipoma. Optic glioma is associated with neurofibromatosis but is not typically associated with tuberous sclerosis. Squamous cell carcinoma is not commonly associated with tuberous sclerosis. However, tuberous sclerosis is associated with cardiac rhabdomyoma and renal cystic disease, both of which increase the risk of developing coronary artery disease."
