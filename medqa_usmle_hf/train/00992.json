The absence of uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries despite normal external sexual organs suggest Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), where the patient has a 46, XY karyotype with partial or complete insensitivity to androgens. This results in male internal sex organs but female external sex organs. The increased serum testosterone with normal conversion to DHT and increased LH levels support this diagnosis. The other karyotypes listed do not explain the absence of internal sex organs."
