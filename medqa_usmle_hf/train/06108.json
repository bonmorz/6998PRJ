Option (C) is the correct answer as an RCT cannot be designed to test a treatment with a known adverse outcome as it violates ethical standards. Options (A), (B), and (D) do not make an RCT unacceptable in terms of study design. In fact, RCTs are often designed to test new treatments that are not yet widespread in use, may not represent the best-known option, and can be expensive."
