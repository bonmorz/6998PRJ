The image shows characteristic facial features of DiGeorge syndrome, which is a congenital anomaly that often involves the thymus and the heart. The flow cytometry result of CD19+ and CD3- suggests a deficiency of T cells, which are developed in the thymus. Aplasia implies complete absence, while agenesis implies failure of an organ to develop fully. Malformation implies a defect in the development of a structure or organ. Of the options, aplasia is the most appropriate as it suggests a complete absence of the thymus in DiGeorge syndrome."

The image suggests a characteristic facial appearance seen in DiGeorge syndrome, which is caused by a deletion on chromosome 22q11.2. This syndrome often involves aplasia or hypoplasia of the thymus, resulting in T-cell deficiency, and can also involve cardiac defects. CD19+ and CD3- result on flow cytometry analysis indicates a lack of T cells, further supporting the diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome. Aplasia refers to the failure of an organ or tissue to develop, making it the correct answer choice."

One of the primary features of this syndrome is thymic aplasia or hypoplasia, which impairs the development of immune system T-cells. Therefore, the answer is (C) aplasia.

The common facial features shown in the image are characteristic of DiGeorge syndrome, which is caused by a deletion in chromosome 22q11.2. DiGeorge syndrome is associated with thymic aplasia or hypoplasia, and the immunophenotype of CD19+ and CD3- is consistent with T-cell deficiency. Aplasia refers to the complete absence of organ development, while hypoplasia refers to the underdevelopment of an organ. In the case of DiGeorge syndrome, the thymus may be absent (aplasia) or underdeveloped (hypoplasia). Therefore, the answer is (C) aplasia."
