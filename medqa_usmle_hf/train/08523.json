The best screening approach, in this case, is to do twice-yearly clinical breast exams, annual mammography, annual breast MRI, and breast self-exams. This approach allows for early detection and improved outcomes. Option A does not include breast MRI, which is recommended for women with BRCA mutations. Option C only includes ultrasound, which is not as sensitive as MRI. Option D only suggests MRI, but other screening methods should also be used."
