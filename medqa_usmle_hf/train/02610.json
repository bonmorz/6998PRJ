The most likely diagnosis is fibroadenoma, which is a common benign breast tumor. Phyllodes tumor is a rare tumor that presents with rapidly growing mass and has distinct histological features. Fibrocystic changes of the breast can present with multiple lumps, tenderness, and a vague feeling of fullness. Fat necrosis usually occurs after breast surgery, radiation therapy, or injury to the breast, and presents as a firm, rounded, and mobile mass."
