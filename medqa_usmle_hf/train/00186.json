Epstein-Barr virus is associated with the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, making option (C) the correct answer. HIV, human papillomavirus, and human T lymphotropic virus type I are not typically associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The abnormal blood counts (high leukocyte count with a neutrophilic predominance) may indicate an inflammatory response to the cancer, but they are not indicative of a particular viral infection."
