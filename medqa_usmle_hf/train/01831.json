Degarelix is also a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist but it is used for advanced prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland. Docetaxel is a chemotherapy agent that can be used in combination with androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer, but it is not the initial treatment for symptoms or bone pain."
