Since the embolic event in this case involves the left atrium, the organs that are supplied by the systemic circulation are at risk, which includes the kidney, spleen, colon, and liver. However, the liver may continue to function despite embolism due to redundancy of its blood supply from the hepatic artery and portal vein. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Liver."
