The best next step in management is to begin an inhibitor of dopamine reuptake, which can improve symptoms of narcolepsy. Options A, C, and D are not appropriate management for narcolepsy."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest narcolepsy, which is a sleep disorder that affects the brain\u2019s ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles. Inhibitors of dopamine reuptake such as modafinil and armodafinil are the preferred medications for treating narcolepsy. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is recommended for patients with sleep apnea, but the patient\u2019s symptoms do not suggest sleep apnea. Scheduling regular naps and more time for sleep at night may not be feasible for the patient due to their job as a waiter. Abstaining from activities at night that expose the patient to blue light may not be effective in treating narcolepsy."

The best next step in management is to begin an inhibitor of dopamine reuptake, such as methylphenidate or modafinil, as these have been shown to improve excessive sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy. Continuous positive airway pressure is used to treat obstructive sleep apnea, which is not the likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Scheduling naps and more time for sleep at night may not be feasible for the patient's job and lifestyle. Recommending abstinence from activities at night that expose the patient to blue light may help improve sleep hygiene, but it will not address the underlying issue of narcolepsy."
