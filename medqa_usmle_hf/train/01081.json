Vitiligo is caused by autoimmune destruction of melanocytes, and among the options, only (D) is related to autoimmunity. Absence of tyrosinase activity will cause albinism, which is not the case here. Infection with Mycobacterium leprae causes leprosy, which usually presents with hypo or hyperpigmentation, but not patchy depigmentation. Malassezia globosa is related to skin fungal infections and is not relevant to this case."

Autoimmune destruction of melanocytes, also known as vitiligo, is the most likely cause of the patient's skin findings. Absence of tyrosinase activity can cause albinism but it would result in a complete lack of pigment rather than lighter patches. Infection with Mycobacterium leprae causes leprosy, which presents with skin lesions and nerve damage, but the skin lesions are different from those seen in vitiligo. Infection with Malassezia globosa is associated with dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis, but not with the skin findings seen in this patient."
