The symptoms and nystagmus in both eyes suggest that the patient is experiencing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), likely caused by debris in the posterior semicircular canal. The particle repositioning maneuver (also known as the Epley maneuver) is the best treatment for BPPV, as it involves physically repositioning the patient\u2019s head to dislodge the debris, allowing it to be reabsorbed by the body. Triptan therapy is typically used for migraines and would not be effective for BPPV. Meclizine can help reduce nausea and vomiting but does not treat the underlying cause of BPPV.
