The patient has a family history of colon cancer, and she also presents with endometrial adenocarcinoma and polyps located in the ascending colon. This suggests Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder that increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and other cancers. Lynch syndrome is caused by mutations in genes involved in DNA mismatch repair, so the correct answer is (C)."

Lynch syndrome is caused by a defect in DNA mismatch repair genes, so option (C), mismatch repair, is the correct answer. Nucleotide-excision repair and base-excision repair usually repair damage caused by environmental factors, and non-homologous end joining is involved in double-strand break repair."
