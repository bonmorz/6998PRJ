The mention of kidney failure and scleral icterus suggest a toxin affecting the liver and kidneys, which can be caused by ingestion of Amanita phalloides or other poisonous mushrooms. These mushrooms contain amatoxins, which inhibit RNA polymerase II, leading to decreased RNA synthesis, especially of small nucleolar RNA. Therefore, the answer is (B)."
