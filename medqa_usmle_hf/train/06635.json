The patient presents with severe abdominal pain, radiation to the back, vomiting, and elevated lipase levels, which are all symptoms of pancreatitis. The increased liver enzyme levels and alkaline phosphatase suggest that there may be underlying liver dysfunction as well. Cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis can cause similar symptoms, but elevated lipase levels are specific to pancreatitis. Duodenal peptic ulcer would not likely cause such an elevated level of lipase."
