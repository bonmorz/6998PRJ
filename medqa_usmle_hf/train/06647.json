Option B is incorrect because it may worsen the patient's volume overload, which is often present in end-stage renal disease patients. Option C is incorrect because there is no indication of hypocalcemia, which is a rare complication of hemodialysis. Option D is incorrect because there is no indication of anemia or active bleeding."
