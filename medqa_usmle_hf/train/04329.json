The progressive loss of vision in one eye and gradual blurring in the other, along with headaches and decreased sense of smell, suggests a tumor affecting the olfactory groove area. The presence of papilledema in the right optic disc and a pale left optic disc also supports the diagnosis of a tumor pushing on the optic nerve. Among the options, the most likely diagnosis is meningioma. Pseudotumor cerebri may cause papilledema but is unlikely to cause different degrees of optic disc pallor. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy usually presents with sudden vision loss and is unlikely to cause papilledema. Multiple sclerosis presents with vision loss in one eye, but it is usually temporary and reversible."
