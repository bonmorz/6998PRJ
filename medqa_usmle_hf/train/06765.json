The elevated nocturnal blood pressure may be due to secondary hypertension from hypercalcemia. Increased serum parathyroid hormone is a hallmark of primary hyperparathyroidism. Increased serum aldosterone-to-renin ratio is seen in secondary hypertension from other causes such as renal artery stenosis. Decreased renal blood flow can cause renal failure but is not typically associated with primary hyperparathyroidism. Decreased nocturnal oxygen saturation is unlikely to be related to this patient's presentation."
