The best initial test for this patient is the overnight dexamethasone suppression test to determine if there is excess cortisol production from the adrenal gland. ACTH stimulation test and inferior petrosal sampling are more helpful if Cushing\u2019s syndrome is suspected to be caused by pituitary gland dysfunction. CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis is less useful since the adrenal nodule has already been identified on prior imaging."
