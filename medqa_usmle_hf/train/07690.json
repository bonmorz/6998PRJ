The symptoms and laboratory findings suggest systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is a type III hypersensitivity reaction. Type I reactions involve IgE antibodies and immediate hypersensitivity reactions, while type II reactions involve IgG or IgM antibodies and cytotoxic reactions against specific cells or tissues. Type IV reactions are delayed hypersensitivity reactions mediated by T cells. SLE is characterized by the formation of immune complexes that deposit systemically which activate complement and induce inflammation."
