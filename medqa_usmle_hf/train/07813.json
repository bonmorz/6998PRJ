The acute onset of pain and limp suggest transient synovitis, and the ultrasound finding of increased joint fluid supports the diagnosis. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis usually occurs in adolescents and is characterized by gradual onset of hip pain with a limited range of motion. Legg-Calve-Perthes disease is also a gradual onset and is more common in boys aged 4-10. Developmental dysplasia of the hip is typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood and is associated with an abnormal hip joint."

Legg-Calve-Perthes disease typically presents with a slowly progressive limp and restricted hip abduction and internal rotation. Developmental dysplasia of the hip usually presents in infancy or early childhood and causes hip instability and limited hip abduction."
