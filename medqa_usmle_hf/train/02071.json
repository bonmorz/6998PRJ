The most common underlying cause of MVP is myxomatous degeneration, which is associated with abnormal Dermatan sulfate deposition. Thus, option A is the correct answer. Congenital valvular fusion (option B) is not associated with MVP, and congenital interventricular communication (option C) would present with a holosystolic murmur. Dystrophic valvular calcification (option D) would present with a systolic ejection murmur."
