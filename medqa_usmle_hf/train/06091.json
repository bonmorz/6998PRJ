The presence of a malformed sacrum also suggests a possible congenital abnormality. Hypoglycemia is a common complication in infants who experience oxygen deprivation, as the stress of birth can lead to high levels of cortisol and catecholamines that can deplete glucose levels. Hypoinsulinemia is unlikely, as insulin secretion is usually increased in response to stress. Hypercalcemia and hypermagnesemia are also unlikely, as they are not commonly associated with birth complications or oxygen deprivation."
