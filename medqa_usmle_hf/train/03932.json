The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest acute stress disorder, which is characterized by symptoms lasting between 3 days and 1 month after exposure to a traumatic event. Adjustment disorder typically has a shorter duration, while PTSD symptoms last for more than 1 month. Persistent complex bereavement disorder is not applicable as the patient\u2019s symptoms are not related to grief or loss. The patient\u2019s history of sexual assault and avoidance behavior are consistent with acute stress disorder."
