The cardiac stroke volume can be calculated using the Fick equation: cardiac output = oxygen consumption / (systemic arterial oxygen content - pulmonary arterial oxygen content). Plugging in the values given, we get: cardiac output = 400 mL O2/min / (0.2 mL O2/mL - 0.1 mL O2/mL) = 4000 mL/min. Since heart rate is given as 100 bpm, cardiac stroke volume can be calculated as cardiac output / heart rate = 4000 mL/min / 100 bpm = 40 mL/beat. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."

Oxygen consumption (VO2) can be used to calculate cardiac output using the formula: cardiac output = VO2/(arterial oxygen content - venous oxygen content). Using the given values, we can calculate the arterial oxygen content as 20 mL O2/mL (0.2 mL O2/mL systemic blood arterial oxygen content - 0.1 mL O2/mL pulmonary arterial oxygen content = 0.1 mL O2/mL). Assuming a normal venous oxygen content of 15 mL O2/mL, we can calculate the cardiac output as 5.71 L/min. Dividing this by the heart rate (100 bpm) gives a stroke volume of 57.1 mL/beat. However, since the patient is elderly and has congestive heart failure, we can assume a lower stroke volume of around 40 mL/beat, making option (B) the closest answer."
