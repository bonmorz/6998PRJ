The history of recent surgery and sudden shortness of breath followed by cardiac arrest suggests the most likely cause of death was a pulmonary embolism, which is consistent with the presence of fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery observed in the lung tissue. This finding can be seen in cases of thromboembolism. Pulmonary ischemia, hypertension, and passive congestion can also cause lung tissue changes, but thromboembolism is the most likely cause in this case given the clinical presentation."
