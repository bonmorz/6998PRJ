Option D, the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone, is a key step in the pentose phosphate pathway, which occurs in the cytoplasm of cells and is therefore accessible to the introduced radioactive isotope. The other options involve reactions that occur in organelles such as mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum, which are usually separated from the cytoplasmic fraction during cell fractionation."
