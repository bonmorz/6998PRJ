The question is asking about the genetics of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is usually not caused by a single genetic mutation. Instead, it is thought to be caused by multiple genetic factors interacting with environmental factors. This fits the definition of polygenic inheritance, which is the inheritance of a trait that is controlled by multiple genes, with each gene having only a small effect on the trait. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. Genomic imprinting refers to the expression of genes depending on whether they are inherited from the mother or the father, and is more relevant to rare genetic disorders. Natural selection and synergistic epistasis are not related to the inheritance of type 2 diabetes mellitus."

Among the options, only polygenic inheritance is relevant in this context. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex, multifactorial disease with contributions from multiple genes and environmental factors. There is no single gene responsible for type 2 diabetes, and it is not inherited in a simple Mendelian fashion like neonatal diabetes or MODY. Instead, it is influenced by a combination of genetic variants, each with a small effect on disease risk, as well as lifestyle and environmental factors. This pattern of inheritance is known as polygenic inheritance."
