Extrinsic asthma is usually caused by an allergic reaction to environmental triggers such as pollen, dust mites, and animal dander. The immune response in extrinsic asthma involves the production of IgE antibodies, which activate Th2 lymphocytes to release inflammation-causing substances. Therefore, the increased quantities of Th2 lymphocytes would predispose the child to extrinsic asthma. Treg lymphocytes and Th1 lymphocytes are not involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, and Kupffer cells are liver macrophages and not relevant to asthma."
