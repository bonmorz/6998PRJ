The cloudy fluid with elevated PMN leukocyte count indicates bacterial infection. Among the options, only inhibition of bacterial peptidoglycan crosslinking (option D) is a mechanism of action for antibiotics that target Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria that can cause peritonitis. Options A, B, and C target different mechanisms and are not appropriate for this patient's condition."

The most appropriate drug mechanism in this case is inhibition of bacterial peptidoglycan crosslinking, which is achieved by antibiotics such as third-generation cephalosporins or amoxicillin/clavulanate. Option (A) is incorrect because it refers to drugs that inhibit bacterial transcription, not peptidoglycan crosslinking. Option (B) is incorrect because it refers to drugs that create free radicals within bacterial cells, which is not a common mechanism of action for antibiotics. Option (C) is incorrect because it refers to drugs that inhibit bacterial ribosomes, specifically the 50S subunit, which is not the most appropriate mechanism for treating bacterial peritonitis."
