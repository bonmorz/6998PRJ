The initial rash was likely an allergic reaction to amoxicillin, and now the patient has developed symptoms consistent with acute interstitial nephritis. Elevated urea and creatinine levels, leukocyturia, and presence of eosinophilic granular cytoplasm in urine cytospin are all indicative of acute interstitial nephritis. Acute glomerulonephritis would be indicated by hematuria and proteinuria. Acute tubular necrosis would be characterized by elevated BUN and creatinine without leukocyturia. IgA nephropathy would have hematuria and proteinuria but not eosinophilic cytoplasm in urine cytospin."

The presence of binucleated cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm supports this diagnosis. Acute glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy would present with different urinary findings.
