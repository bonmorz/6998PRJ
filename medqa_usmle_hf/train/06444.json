The patient has a persistent and worsening deep venous thrombosis, as well as a low platelet count, which suggests thrombocytopenia, a potential complication of heparin use. As a result, a direct thrombin inhibitor, such as argatroban or dabigatran, may be more appropriate for this patient than heparin. Anti-thrombin III activators, such as heparin, are contraindicated in patients with thrombocytopenia. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors, such as aspirin, may help prevent arterial thrombosis but are not indicated for the treatment of venous thrombosis. Vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibitors, such as warfarin, are not recommended for initial treatment of acute venous thrombosis."

The patient has evidence of a recurrent DVT and a low platelet count, suggesting heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Therefore, an alternative anticoagulation therapy should be initiated. Among the options, a direct thrombin inhibitor, such as argatroban or dabigatran, is a suitable alternative for HIT. Anti-thrombin III activators, such as heparin, should be avoided in this situation. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors do not have significant anticoagulation effects, and vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibitors are used for anticoagulation in the context of atrial fibrillation, rather than acute thrombosis."

The patient has a persistent deep venous thrombosis despite being on low-molecular weight heparin, and the platelet count of 74,000/mm^3 suggests heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Thus, a direct thrombin inhibitor, such as argatroban or bivalirudin, is the most appropriate medication to initiate after stopping the heparin drip. Anti-thrombin III activators, such as fondaparinux, are also an option, but direct thrombin inhibitors should be preferred in the case of HIT. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors, such as aspirin, are used for prophylaxis of arterial thromboembolic events, not for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis. Vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibitors, such as warfarin, have a delayed onset and require bridging therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant, making them a less appropriate choice for this acute situation."
