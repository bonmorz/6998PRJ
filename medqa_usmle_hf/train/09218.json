The symptoms, including a non-productive cough, pain during swallowing, and congested tympanic membrane, suggest an upper respiratory infection. The blood test results show a mild leukocytosis with a left shift, and low titers of cold agglutinins suggest Mycoplasma pneumonia. The chest radiograph shows nodular opacities consistent with this diagnosis. Staphylococcus aureus can cause pneumonia, but it typically presents with a more acute onset and more severe symptoms. Haemophilus influenzae is a common cause of pneumonia but typically in older patients or those with underlying lung disease. Chlamydia psittaci is associated with pneumonia only in patients with exposure to infected birds or contaminated material."
