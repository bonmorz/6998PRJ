The fact that she takes escitalopram for generalized anxiety disorder suggests that her psychological state could be a contributing factor to her symptoms. Polymyalgia rheumatica may present with similar symptoms, but typically affects older adults and has an associated elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Polymyositis would present with muscle weakness, which is not seen in this patient. Major depressive disorder could cause somatic symptoms such as pain, but would not explain the widespread pain and tenderness seen in fibromyalgia."

The family history of ankylosing spondylitis may suggest a rheumatologic disorder, but X-rays showed no abnormalities. Polymyalgia rheumatica and polymyositis are less likely because muscle strength is normal. Major depressive disorder may cause physical symptoms, but it is unlikely to cause widespread pain and tenderness."
