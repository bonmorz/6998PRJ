Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiotherapy, enucleation, and a combination of these treatments depending on the size and location of the tumor. In this case, since the tumor has already spread along the optic nerve and vitreous seeding, enucleation (the surgical removal of the entire eyeball) is the most appropriate treatment option to prevent further spread of the tumor and to minimize the risk of cancer recurrence."
