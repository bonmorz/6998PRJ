The symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and vomiting after eating, as well as the low glucose level, support this diagnosis. Insulin overdose would produce hypoglycemia, but there are no symptoms of overdose, and the C-peptide level is normal. Malnutrition may cause confusion, but there is no evidence of malnutrition in the laboratory values. Propranolol overdose would not cause hypoglycemia or confusion, and there is no evidence of an overdose in the patient's history."

The patient\u2019s past medical history of sleeve gastrectomy and the symptoms suggest dumping syndrome, which can occur after bariatric surgery. In dumping syndrome, food moves too quickly through the stomach and into the small intestine, causing an exaggerated insulin response and hypoglycemia. The normal C-peptide level rules out insulin overdose. Malnutrition would not cause hypoglycemia and confusion, and there is no indication of propranolol overdose."
