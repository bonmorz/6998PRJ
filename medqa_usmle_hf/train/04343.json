The fact that more of drug B is required to produce the same response as drug A suggests that drug B has lower potency than drug A. Potency is defined as the amount of drug required to produce a specific effect, whereas efficacy is the ability of a drug to produce a desired effect. Affinity is the degree to which a drug binds to a receptor site. There is no information in the question provided to determine whether there is a difference in affinity between the two drugs."

The graph shows a typical dose-response curve with increasing doses of the drugs produce an increasing response until reaching a plateau.
