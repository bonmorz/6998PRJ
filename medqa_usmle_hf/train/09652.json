The process of thymus-dependent B cell activation involves the selection and maturation of B cells in germinal centers, which undergo affinity maturation to produce higher quality antibodies. This process occurs during the course of an infection, as the body's immune system works to fight off the pathogen. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Affinity maturation. Options (A) and (B) refer to earlier stages of B cell development that occur in the bone marrow, while (C) refers to a process of T cell selection that occurs in the thymus."

The question is asking about the process of thymus-dependent B cell activation, which involves the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs. During an infection, B cells undergo affinity maturation within the germinal centers, which is the process by which B cells with higher affinity for the pathogen are selected and undergo further proliferation and differentiation into plasma cells that can produce immunoglobulins at a faster pace. Development of early pro-B cells and immature B cells do not specifically relate to thymus-dependent B cell activation, and T cell negative selection occurs in the thymus, not in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs."
