Elevated immunoglobulin levels may also be seen in primary immune deficiencies, but this is not specific to B cell deficiency. Elevated T cell numbers may be seen in viral infections or lymphoproliferative disorders, but this is not likely the cause of the patient\u2019s recurrent bacterial infections."
