The question is asking for additional features of the causative organism of community acquired pneumonia. The answer choices provide information about whether the organism is catalase positive or negative, hemolytic (alpha or beta) and optochin sensitive or resistant. This suggests that the organism is a type of Streptococcus, as these are the types of tests commonly used to identify different species of Streptococcus. Based on the information provided, the most likely answer is (C) Catalase negative, alpha hemolytic, optochin sensitive, which would correspond to Streptococcus pneumoniae, one of the most common causes of community acquired pneumonia."
