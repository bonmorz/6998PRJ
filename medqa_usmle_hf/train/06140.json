The patient's BMI of 16.4 also indicates severe weight loss. Inpatient nutritional rehabilitation is the most appropriate next step in management to address the patient's malnourishment and restore her to a healthy weight. Outpatient follow-up or psychotherapy alone may not be sufficient for a patient with such severe malnourishment. Fluoxetine therapy, an SSRI antidepressant, may be helpful in some cases but is not the first-line treatment for anorexia nervosa."

Fluoxetine therapy, while commonly used to treat other eating disorders, should not be used alone in the treatment of anorexia nervosa."
