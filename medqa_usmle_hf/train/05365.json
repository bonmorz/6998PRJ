Incidence represents the number of new cases of the disease over a period of time. Since the incidence of PBC has remained stable, it is more likely that the increased prevalence is due to improved quality of care, which has led to better management and longer survival of patients with PBC. Increased awareness and availability of diagnostic testing may also contribute to earlier diagnosis and treatment, but these are less likely to account for the significant increase in prevalence. Increased exposure to environmental risk factors is another possibility, but this would likely lead to an increase in incidence, rather than prevalence, over time."

Prevalence refers to the total number of cases of a disease in a population at a specific time, while incidence refers to the number of new cases of a disease in a population over a specific time period. Since the incidence of PBC has remained stable over the past 20 years, it is unlikely that increased exposure to environmental risk factors is the explanation for the increased prevalence. Increased awareness of PBC among clinicians and increased availability of diagnostic testing may lead to earlier detection of cases, but these factors alone would not explain the increased prevalence. The most plausible explanation is that there has been improved quality of care for PBC, leading to increased survival rates and longer disease duration, resulting in a higher prevalence of cases over time. Therefore, the answer is (B)."

Incidence refers to the number of new cases diagnosed within a given time period. The question asks about the increased prevalence of PBC, which refers to the total number of cases present in the population at any given time. This suggests that there are more people living with PBC now than there were 20 years ago. Therefore, the most plausible explanation for this increase in prevalence is improved quality of care for PBC. This means that people with PBC are living longer and better-quality lives with the condition, leading to more cases present in the population at any given time.
