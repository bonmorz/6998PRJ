The symptoms of pain in the lower back and thighs, along with the progressive lower limb weakness, suggest lumbar spinal stenosis. The fact that the pain is relieved by standing still also supports this diagnosis. Decreased bilateral femoral pulses could be found on physical examination due to the vascular compression from lumbar spinal stenosis. The other options are not associated with this diagnosis."
