                "content": "We use the formula: CO = SV x HR, where CO is cardiac output, SV is stroke volume, and HR is heart rate. Rearranging the formula gives us: SV = CO/HR. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: SV = 6000 mL/60 beats/min = 100 mL/beat. End-systolic volume (ESV) is the volume of blood remaining in the ventricle at the end of systole. The ejection fraction is calculated as follows: EF = (EDV - ESV)/EDV, where EDV is end-diastolic volume. Rearranging the formula gives us: ESV = EDV - (EF x EDV). EF is given in the question as 60%, which means EF = 0.6. EDV is not given, but we can assume it to be the average value of 120 mL for a healthy individual. Substituting these values, we get: ESV = 120 mL - (0.6 x 120 mL) = 48 mL. However, this is for a healthy individual, and the question does not provide any information on the patient's EDV. Therefore, we cannot calculate ESV using the ejection fraction formula. Instead, we can use the formula: ESV = EDV - SV. Substituting the values calculated earlier, we get: ESV = 100 mL - 60 mL = 40 mL. Therefore, the answer is (C)."

However, the question is asking for the end-systolic volume, which is typically about 40% of the stroke volume. Therefore, the end-systolic volume would be 0.4 x 60 = 24 mL or approximately 40 mL, which is closest to option (C)."

Therefore, the end-diastolic volume must be 60% higher than the end-systolic volume. To calculate the end-systolic volume, we first need to find the end-diastolic volume, which is the volume of blood in the heart at the end of diastole (when the heart is relaxed and filling with blood). We can calculate the end-diastolic volume using cardiac output and heart rate: End-diastolic volume = Cardiac output / Heart rate. In this case, the cardiac output is given as 6 L/min and the heart rate as 100/min, so the end-diastolic volume is 60 mL. Since the ejection fraction is 60%, the end-systolic volume is 40 mL (60% of 100 mL). Therefore, the answer is (C) 40 mL."

The ejection fraction is the percentage of blood pumped out of the heart with each heartbeat, and it is calculated by dividing the stroke volume by the end-diastolic volume.

We can rearrange the formula for cardiac output (CO = SV x HR) to solve for the end-diastolic volume: EDV = CO / HR x 60. Plugging in the values, we get EDV = 6 L/min / 100/min x 60 = 360 mL. To calculate the end-systolic volume, we need to subtract the stroke volume (3.6 L or 3600 mL) from the end-diastolic volume (360 mL).
