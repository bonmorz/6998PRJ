The findings described constitute a triad characteristic of Trisomy 18 (Edward Syndrome): micrognathia, prominent occiput with flattened nasal bridge, and pointy low-set ears. Other clues include upward slanting eyes with small palpebral fissures, clenched fists, overlapping digits, widely spaced nipples, prominent heels and rounded soles. Maternal alcohol intake would cause fetal alcohol syndrome, which may present with microcephaly and a smooth philtrum. Trisomy of chromosome 21 (Down Syndrome) would present with intellectual disability and characteristic facial features, such as a flattened face and upward slanting eyes, but not the other physical findings described. FMR1 gene silencing would suggest Fragile X Syndrome, which may cause intellectual disability and autistic-like behavior, but does not present with the same physical findings."

The combination of micrognathia, prominent occiput with flattened nasal bridge, low-set ears, upward slanting eyes, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, widely spaced nipples, and prominent heels with convex soles is a classic presentation of Trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome. Maternal alcohol intake can cause fetal alcohol syndrome, which has a different presentation. Trisomy 21, also known as Down syndrome, presents with a different set of physical features. FMR1 gene silencing is associated with Fragile X syndrome, which also has a distinct presentation."

Trisomy of chromosome 21, also known as Down syndrome, can present with similar features but typically has a different combination of abnormalities. Maternal alcohol intake can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, which can cause abnormalities but does not typically present with this specific combination of features.

The physical findings suggest the baby has multiple abnormalities, including micrognathia, pointy low-set ears, upward slanting eyes, clenched fists, overlapping fingers, widely spaced nipples, and prominent heels and rounded soles of the feet.
