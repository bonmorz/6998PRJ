The patient's signs and symptoms suggest acanthosis nigricans, which is associated with insulin resistance and obesity. The irregular and heavy menses also suggest possible polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is commonly associated with insulin resistance. Therefore, further evaluation is likely to show polycystic ovaries on ultrasonography of the pelvis. A diffusely enlarged thyroid gland is not associated with acanthosis nigricans or PCOS. Elevated serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels are associated with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which usually presents with ambiguous genitalia in females and is unlikely in this patient. Malignant glandular cells on gastric biopsy are not related to the patient's signs and symptoms."
