The patient has symptoms of heart failure with crackles and edema, along with T wave inversions suggesting underlying coronary artery disease. Among the options, metoprolol is a beta-blocker that has been shown to improve long-term survival in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease. Gemfibrozil is used to treat hyperlipidemia but would not address the patient's current symptoms. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that can be used in hypertension management but does not improve long-term survival in heart failure patients. Dobutamine is a positive inotrope but is reserved for patients with severe systolic dysfunction or critically ill patients in the hospital setting."
