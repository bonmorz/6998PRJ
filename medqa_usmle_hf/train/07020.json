Based on the question, the drug inhibits the glucose transporter, so we can expect a decrease in Vmax (maximum transport velocity). However, the drug was designed to act upon the transporter similarly to cyanide upon cytochrome proteins, which suggests that there will be irreversible inhibition of the transporter. This would result in an unchanged Km (substrate concentration at which transport velocity is half of Vmax) but a decreased Vmax. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) unchanged Km and decreased Vmax."

Inhibition of a transporter that moves glucose into the cell would result in decreased uptake of glucose, which would lead to decreased Vmax (the maximal rate of transport). The Km (the concentration of glucose that results in half-maximal transport) would not change, as this is a measure of the affinity of the transporter for glucose and is unaffected by inhibition of the transporter.

The drug inhibits the glucose transporter used by intestinal enterocytes to absorb glucose into the body, which means that the drug will decrease the Vmax (maximum velocity) of the transporter. The drug acts similarly to how cyanide acts upon cytochrome proteins, which means that the drug will likely irreversibly alter the glucose transporter, leading to a decrease in the number of transporters and thus a decrease in Vmax. However, the drug is not affecting the substrate (glucose) directly, so Km (Michaelis constant) should remain unchanged. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Unchanged Km and decreased Vmax."
