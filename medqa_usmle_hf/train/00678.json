The patient has only been on paroxetine therapy for 6 weeks and is showing positive improvements in his mood, energy levels, sleep, and ability to function in daily activities. Therefore, it is appropriate to continue the medication for longer than 6 months. Option D is not appropriate as lithium therapy is not typically used for major depressive episodes. Option B would not be appropriate as the patient has shown improvement on paroxetine therapy. Option C may be appropriate in some cases, but in this case, the patient's history of previous episodes and positive response to therapy suggest that longer-term maintenance therapy may be needed. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to continue paroxetine therapy for 2 years."
