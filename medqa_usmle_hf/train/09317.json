Hyperprolactinemia can cause irregular periods and infertility but is usually associated with elevated prolactin levels.

The patient\u2019s FSH level indicates primary ovarian insufficiency, which means the ovaries are not functioning properly and may not ovulate regularly or at all. This can lead to infertility. The other options, such as hyperprolactinemia or polycystic ovary syndrome, can cause irregular periods but usually have other symptoms as well. Secondary ovarian insufficiency is a rare condition caused by a defect in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, which results in decreased production of FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH). The patient\u2019s FSH level is high, indicating primary ovarian insufficiency rather than secondary."
