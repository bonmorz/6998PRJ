The location of the aneurysm compresses the ocular nerve, which normally controls movement of the eye upward, inward, and downward. The unopposed superior oblique muscle rotates the eye downward, causing the patient's symptoms. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. The parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve fibers control pupillary constriction and dilation respectively and are not directly related to the oculomotor findings in this case."

The location of the aneurysm suggests compression of the oculomotor nerve, specifically the superior division that innervates the levator palpebrae superioris muscle and the medial rectus muscle. This results in unopposed action of the superior oblique muscle, which rotates the eye downward. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.

The patient\u2019s dilated left pupil and downward deviation of the eye suggest a lesion affecting the oculomotor nerve. Specifically, an aneurysm at the junction of the posterior communicating artery and the posterior cerebral artery is compressing the ocular nerve. This would result in unopposed superior oblique muscle rotation of the eye downward. Option A is incorrect because activation of the parasympathetic nerve fibers of the eye would cause constriction of the pupil, which contradicts the patient\u2019s findings. Option C is incorrect because unopposed inferior oblique muscle would cause upward deviation of the eye. Option D is incorrect because inhibition of the sympathetic nerve fibers of the eye would cause constriction of the pupil and drooping of the eyelid, which are not seen in this patient."
