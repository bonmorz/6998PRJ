The mechanism of injury (landing on the anterior aspect of the knee) and the finding of posterior displacement of the left tibia when force is applied to the proximal tibia after flexing the knee suggest a Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury. An avulsion fracture of the tibial condyle supports this diagnosis as avulsion fractures are typically caused by the PCL being pulled off its attachment site on the condyle. The other options would have different mechanisms of injury and findings on physical examination."
