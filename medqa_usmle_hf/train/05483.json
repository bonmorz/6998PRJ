Elevated serum iron levels can occur due to increased absorption from Vitamin C supplementation, but the negative guaiac test rules out occult bleeding as a cause for the elevated iron levels."

The patient's lab findings suggest iron overload, which can be caused by excessive intake of iron-rich substances or iron supplements. However, since the stool guaiac test is negative for occult blood, it is unlikely that the bleeding ulcer is causing the iron overload. Among the options, only ascorbic acid (vitamin C) can increase iron absorption and cause iron overload when taken in excess. The patient's history of taking dietary supplements \"to cope\" raises suspicion for excessive intake of vitamin C supplements."
