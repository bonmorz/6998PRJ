Developmental dysplasia of the hip presents as a limp and decreased hip abduction, while slipped capital femoral epiphysis presents with hip, groin or thigh pain with limited range of motion. Stress fracture presents with focal pain that increases with activity, and there is no mention of trauma."

The tenderness over the lateral aspect of the hip and pain with passive internal rotation also support this diagnosis. Developmental dysplasia of the hip usually presents in early infancy or childhood, while slipped capital femoral epiphysis usually presents in adolescents and is characterized by acute onset of hip pain after a minor trauma or with no identifiable event. Stress fractures typically present with acute onset pain with activity and resolve with rest."
