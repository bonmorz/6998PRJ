The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest tension pneumothorax, which occurs when air enters the pleural cavity and is not able to escape, causing the lung to collapse and putting pressure on the mediastinum. Tracheal deviation to the opposite side of the injury is an important clinical sign of tension pneumothorax. Consolidation of the left lower lobe (A) and collection of fluid in the left lung base (B) are findings associated with other conditions such as pneumonia or pleural effusion. Tracheal deviation to the left (C) is not associated with tension pneumothorax."
