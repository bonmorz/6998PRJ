Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to administer heparin to prevent further clot formation and improve blood flow to the affected area. Oxygen can be helpful in stroke treatment, but heparin is a more immediate and critical intervention. Mannitol is used to reduce brain swelling, which is not present in this case. Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent that can dissolve blood clots, but it must be used within a certain time frame and in carefully selected patients. In this case, initial management should focus on preventing further clot formation and stabilizing the patient's condition before considering alteplase."
