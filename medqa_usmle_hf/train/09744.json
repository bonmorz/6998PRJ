This is because it involves the cingulate gyrus being pushed under the falx cerebri, which is located between the left and right cerebral hemispheres, resulting in compression of the anterior cerebral artery leading to motor deficits. Upward brainstem herniation and central transtentorial herniation involve more severe symptoms and usually result in coma. Extracranial herniation is not a recognized type of herniation."

The patient had a fall and hit his head, and now presents with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, headache, and leg weakness. The bruise on the right side of his skull suggests that the most likely cause is subfalcine herniation, in which the brain shifts under the falx cerebri, causing compression and damage to the opposite hemisphere. Upward brainstem herniation causes compression of the midbrain, resulting in decerebrate posturing, abnormalities in breathing, and pupillary dilation. Central transtentorial herniation causes a decrease in level of consciousness, pupillary abnormalities, and hemiplegia. Extracranial herniation is not a recognized type of herniation."

The patient's symptoms suggest a subfalcine herniation, which occurs when the brain herniates beneath the falx cerebri and presses against one hemisphere of the brain. This can cause motor weakness on the opposite side of the body. Upward brainstem herniation and central transtentorial herniation can also cause neurological symptoms, but they typically involve changes in consciousness or vital signs. Extracranial herniation is not a recognized type of brain herniation."
