The presenting symptoms, including shortness of breath, abdominal distension, and leg swelling, suggest congestive heart failure (CHF). The laboratory findings show elevated AST and ALT, which can indicate liver damage from alcohol abuse. Therefore, the best next step in management is alcohol cessation to prevent further liver damage and improve overall heart function in CHF. Antiviral therapy is not indicated as there is no evidence of viral infection. Hormone replacement and vitamin repletion are also not indicated in this case."
