It also creates an opportunity for further discussion about the patient's concerns and needs. Option A can come across as lecture-like and may make the patient defensive. Option C may come across as dismissive of the patient's experiences and may further erode trust in the medical system. Option D may be premature and stigmatizing, as the patient's feelings may be a natural response to a difficult illness."

Response (B) acknowledges the patient\u2019s feelings and shows empathy, which can be helpful in building rapport and trust with the patient. Response (A) comes across as confrontational and may cause the patient to become defensive. Response (C) implies that the previous doctors were incompetent, which may make the patient feel judged or misunderstood. Response (D) suggests that the patient\u2019s feelings are abnormal or irrational and may stigmatize mental health issues. It is not indicated to jump to a referral to psychiatry without further exploration of the patient\u2019s concerns and needs."
