The costovertebral angle tenderness on the right side also supports this diagnosis. The negative urine findings for protein, RBC casts, and WBC casts, but presence of RBCs and WBCs, suggest an obstructive process rather than infection, ruling out pyelonephritis. Cholecystitis and pelvic inflammatory disease are less likely given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings."
