The severe ataxia and inability to form new memories suggest Korsakoff amnesia, which is caused by thiamine deficiency often seen in chronic alcoholics. Delirium is a more acute disturbance of consciousness, and delirium tremens is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that includes features of delirium but does not typically cause permanent memory impairment. Dementia is a chronic and progressive decline in cognitive function."
