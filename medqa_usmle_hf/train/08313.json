The fact that they occur after soccer practice and improve with sleep also supports this diagnosis. The recent diagnosis of myopic vision could also be a contributing factor to the headaches. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to initiate acetaminophen therapy for pain relief. Neuro-optometric assessment would be more appropriate if the symptoms were related to vision problems, which is not the case here. MRI of the brain and acyclovir therapy are not indicated based on the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation."

Neuro-optometric assessment is not necessary given the patient\u2019s history and symptoms. There is no indication for an MRI of the brain, as there are no focal neurological symptoms or signs.
