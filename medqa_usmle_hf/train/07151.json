In this study design, the investigator follows two groups of patients (with and without osteoporosis) over a 10-year period to look for the occurrence of distal radius fractures. This matches the definition of a cohort study. A case-control study would involve identifying patients with and without distal radius fractures and comparing their previous exposure to osteoporosis. A case series would involve presenting a group of patients with distal radius fractures and documenting their characteristics. An ecological study would involve analyzing and comparing data at a population level."

This is a cohort study design. Matching patients on age, sex, and body mass index is a technique used to control for known confounding variables. A case-control study would involve identifying patients with the outcome of interest (distal radius fracture) and comparing them to a group without the outcome to determine potential risk factors, but it does not involve the same follow-up period as a cohort study. A case series is a descriptive study that reports on a series of patients with a certain condition or outcome, but there is no control group. An ecological study is a type of observational study that examines associations between exposures or risk factors and outcomes at the population level, rather than at the individual level."
