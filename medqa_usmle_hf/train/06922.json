The patient's pattern of going to bed and waking up late on the weekends suggest that the most likely diagnosis is delayed sleep-wake disorder, which results from a shift in the timing of the sleep-wake cycle. Psychophysiologic insomnia is characterized by worry and anxiety about sleep that exacerbate the insomnia. Advanced sleep-wake disorder is a shift of the circadian rhythm that causes an earlier sleep onset and wake time. Irregular sleep-wake disorder is characterized by fragmented sleep patterns throughout the day and night. None of the other options fit this patient's presentation as well as delayed sleep-wake disorder."

The patient\u2019s symptoms of difficulty falling asleep until 2 a.m. and feeling rested after sleeping in until 10 a.m. on the weekends suggest delayed sleep-wake disorder, which is characterized by a delay in the timing of the major sleep episode compared with the desired sleep-wake schedule. This is the most likely explanation given the patient\u2019s history. Psychophysiologic insomnia is associated with increased muscular and cognitive activity, which is not described in the patient\u2019s history. Advanced sleep-wake disorder and irregular sleep-wake disorder both involve a disrupted sleep-wake cycle, but do not match the patient\u2019s symptoms."

The patient's symptoms, including difficulty falling asleep at a regular time on school nights, difficulty waking up on weekdays, and sleeping in on weekends, suggest delayed sleep-wake disorder, which is typically seen in adolescents and young adults. Psychophysiologic insomnia is characterized by anxiety and tension around sleep, but the patient does not report this. Advanced sleep-wake disorder occurs when the sleep-wake cycle is shifted earlier, which is not the case for this patient. Irregular sleep-wake disorder is characterized by fragmented sleep patterns with multiple naps, which does not fit this patient's schedule."

The patient\u2019s sleep pattern suggests that he has a delayed sleep-wake disorder which is characterized by a delayed timing of the sleep episode relative to the desired clock time. This is often seen in adolescents and young adults who have a natural inclination to stay up later and sleep later. Psychophysiologic insomnia is usually associated with a physical or psychological condition and is not supported by the patient\u2019s history. Advanced sleep-wake disorder is when there is an earlier onset and offset of the sleep period and irregular sleep-wake disorder is when sleep is fragmented into multiple episodes throughout the day and night."
