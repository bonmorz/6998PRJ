The symptoms, including tearing and burning quality pain radiating to the back, suggest a possible esophageal rupture or perforation due to the presence of a large hiatal hernia.

Coronary angiography and contrast-enhanced CT of the aorta are not indicated based on the patient's symptoms and history. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed the day before and diagnosed gastritis, which is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms."

The mediastinal lucency on chest x-ray may suggest a diagnosis of Boerhaave syndrome, which is characterized by a perforation of the esophagus due to vomiting or retching. Thus, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be a contrast esophagography with gastrografin to evaluate for esophageal perforation. Coronary angiography would not be indicated in this case, as the patient's troponin I level is only mildly elevated and his EKG findings are more consistent with a left bundle branch block than acute coronary syndrome. Contrast-enhanced CT of the aorta would not be indicated in this case, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings are not consistent with aortic dissection. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy may be diagnostic, but is not appropriate in the acute setting when esophageal perforation is suspected."

The symptoms and history suggest a possible aortic dissection, and the physical exam shows crackling with every heartbeat, which further supports this. A contrast esophagography with gastrografin can help diagnose a hiatal hernia and rule out an aortic dissection involving the esophagus. Coronary angiography is not necessary at this point since the EKG does not show acute ischemia. A CT of the aorta can be helpful for diagnosing an aortic dissection, but it does not directly assess the hiatal hernia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is not needed as it was performed recently and has already shown gastritis and hiatal hernia."

Coronary angiography is not indicated as the patient\u2019s troponin I level is not elevated, and there are no significant EKG changes to suggest an acute myocardial infarction.

Contrast-enhanced CT of the aorta may be useful to rule out aortic dissection, given the patient's family history and hypertension, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario.
