The presentation of painful and swollen leg with tenderness in the popliteal fossa suggests a possible deep vein thrombosis. The best initial step in the management is to use Wells\u2019 clinical probability tool to assess the likelihood of DVT. This will guide the decision for further testing or treatment. CT with contrast is not the initial step and is usually reserved for cases where the DVT diagnosis is uncertain or if there is suspicion of pulmonary embolism. INR and aPTT are tests used to evaluate coagulation, but they are not useful in the initial management of DVT."
