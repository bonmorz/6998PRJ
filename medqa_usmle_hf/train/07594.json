The patient\u2019s past history and lack of recent vaccinations put her at risk for tetanus, an infection caused by Clostridium tetani. Tetanus vaccination is recommended for pregnant women, and a two-dose schedule should be administered within a 4-week interval to ensure adequate immunity and to protect both the mother and the baby. Even if the mother is vaccinated, it will still be necessary to administer toxoid to the newborn. Option A is incorrect because the patient\u2019s natural immunity is not sufficient, and it is not clear whether she will pass immunity to the baby. Option B is incorrect because the patient is still at risk for tetanus and not fully protected."

The patient's history of tetanus infection does not confer immunity for life and vaccination is still recommended to ensure optimal protection. Option C would provide the patient with enough time to develop immunity before delivery. The baby would also require vaccination after delivery. Option A is incorrect because natural immunity against tetanus requires a natural infection, not just a previous vaccination. Option B is incorrect because the patient is still at risk for tetanus, especially during an out-of-hospital delivery. Option D is incorrect because the newborn would require vaccination, not just toxoid administration."

The patient should receive at least 2 doses of tetanus toxoid within a 4-week interval during pregnancy to ensure that she and her baby will have immunity against tetanus. Additionally, the newborn should also receive a dose of tetanus toxoid within 24 hours of birth. Option (A) is incorrect because natural immunity is not always protective, and it cannot be relied upon for protection against tetanus. Option (B) is also incorrect because the mother is still at risk of developing tetanus after an out-of-hospital delivery. Option (D) is only partially correct because the newborn should receive tetanus toxoid, but it is not dependent on the mother receiving the vaccine."
