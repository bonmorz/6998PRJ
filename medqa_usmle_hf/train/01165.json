Among the options, only potassium channel blockers can cause this reaction. This is because potassium channels regulate pulmonary vascular tone and blockade of these channels can cause pulmonary edema. Calcium channel blockers can cause pulmonary edema as well, but not ground glass changes on CT. Sodium channel blockers can cause respiratory depression or bronchospasm, but not the symptoms described in the patient. Among the sodium channel blockers, only those with a prolonged refractory period are used as antiarrhythmic agents, but they do not cause the symptoms associated with this patient."
