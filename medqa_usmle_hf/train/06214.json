The patient\u2019s symptoms including horizontal gaze palsy, vestibulo-ocular reflex impairment, and truncal ataxia are suggestive of Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy caused by Vitamin B1 deficiency. Delirium Tremens would have more severe symptoms like agitation, hallucination, and autonomic hyperactivity. Miller-Fisher syndrome causes areflexia, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia, but the symptoms are not severe enough to explain this patient\u2019s condition. Ethylene glycol intoxication is unlikely given the normal vital signs and lack of sensory deficits."
