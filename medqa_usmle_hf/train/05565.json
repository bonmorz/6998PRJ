It is important to note that the child's behaviors are occurring in specific situations (getting dressed/dropped off, mealtime/bedtime) and that he is well-behaved during the day at daycare. Additionally, his behavior is consistent with typical development for a 3-year-old experiencing some separation anxiety in response to his mother returning to work. Therefore, the most likely cause of his behavior is normal development. The other options, such as autism spectrum disorder, conduct disorder, and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, would have different symptoms and would not be consistent with the child's behavior as described."

It's normal for young children to have tantrums when they are upset or frustrated, especially during times of change or transition. While it is always important to monitor a child's behavior and seek medical advice if concerned, at this point it seems unlikely that the boy has a behavioral disorder such as autism spectrum disorder or conduct disorder. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is typically diagnosed in older children and adolescents who exhibit severe and recurrent temper outbursts."

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is typically characterized by severe temper outbursts that are out of proportion to the situation, occurring at least 3 times per week.
