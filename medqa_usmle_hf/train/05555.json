The symptoms suggest that the boy has a syrinx, which is a cyst-like cavity filled with cerebrospinal fluid in the spinal cord, causing swelling and redness on the skin. Among the options, Arnold-Chiari malformation is the most likely cause of syrinx formation. Leprosy and spina bifida occulta do not cause syrinx formation. Transverse myelitis can cause sensory, motor, and autonomic dysfunction, but the symptoms are typically more focal and not cape-like."

Leprosy may also cause loss of sensation but is highly unlikely in this case because of the patient's recent injury. Spina bifida occulta is a bony defect and would not cause a cape-like distribution of sensory loss. Transverse myelitis would likely cause motor and sensory deficits below the spinal cord level, rather than in a cape-like distribution."
