Celecoxib or sulindac therapy is not recommended for Lynch syndrome. Measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19-9 yearly is not recommended in patients with Lynch syndrome.

The patient has a family history of multiple types of cancer and has mutations in DNA repair genes MLH1 and MSH2, which increase her risk for developing hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Thus, she will require annual colonoscopy beginning at 20-25 years of age to screen for HNPCC. Celecoxib or sulindac therapy is used for colon cancer prevention in individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis, but this patient's colonoscopy was unremarkable. Carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19-9 are markers for certain types of cancer but are not recommended for routine screening in individuals without a personal history of cancer. Surgical removal of a desmoid tumor is not applicable in this patient's case."

The patient\u2019s family history and genetic test results suggest Lynch syndrome, which predisposes her to colorectal and other cancers. Thus, annual colonoscopy beginning at 20-25 years of age is recommended for patients with Lynch syndrome to detect cancerous growth as soon as it occurs. Celecoxib or sulindac therapy can reduce polyp formation in some patients with Lynch syndrome, but it is not the most likely recommended course of action for this patient. Measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19-9 yearly is not recommended as a screening test for individuals with Lynch syndrome.
