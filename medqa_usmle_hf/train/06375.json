The given lab values show hyponatremia and low serum osmolality, indicating water retention (increased hydrostatic pressure). The low urine sodium is consistent with inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion. Inappropriate ADH secretion can cause decreased serum uric acid levels. Increased serum bicarbonate and increased urinary frequency are not commonly associated with this condition. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."
