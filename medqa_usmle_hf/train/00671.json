Option (A) is incorrect as increased calcium levels are not typically seen in vitamin D deficiency. Option (B) is incorrect as both calcium and phosphate levels are decreased in vitamin D deficiency, not increased. Option (D) is incorrect as calcium levels are typically decreased in vitamin D deficiency."
