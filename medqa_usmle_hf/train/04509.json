Phenotypic mixing is the most likely explanation, where the virus co-infects the same cell with another virus that has neuraminidase on its surface, resulting in the appearance of neuraminidase on the surface of the new virus even though its genome does not contain the neuraminidase gene. Transduction involves transfer of genetic material by a bacteriophage, reassortment involves exchange of genome segments between different strains of a virus, and complementation involves the use of products from different genes to make a functional protein or enzyme. None of these mechanisms are likely to result in the observed phenotype."

Phenotypic mixing occurs when two strains of a virus infect the same cell, and the viral proteins become mixed on the surface of the virus particles that are released. This can result in a virus particle with a different genotype than the original infecting virus. So in this case, it is possible that the strain without the neuraminidase gene has acquired it from another strain through phenotypic mixing. This is in contrast to reassortment, which involves the exchange of entire genome segments between two different strains of the virus."

Phenotypic mixing or viral interference occurs when parts of two different viruses infect a host cell at the same time.
