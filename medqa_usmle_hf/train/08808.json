The patient has sudden onset hypertension and symptoms suggestive of anxiety or panic attack, which makes a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma likely. Increased urine metanephrines are a hallmark of pheochromocytoma. Decreased hemoglobin and decreased TSH levels suggest anemia and hypothyroidism respectively, neither of which is likely to cause sudden onset hypertension. Increased serum serotonin is associated with carcinoid tumors, which is not likely given the patient's symptoms and family history."
