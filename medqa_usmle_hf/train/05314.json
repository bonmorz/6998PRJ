The patient presents with symptoms of a kidney stone, as evidenced by the severe abdominal pain and blood in the urine. The CT scan confirms the presence of a calcium-containing kidney stone. The urine test reveals high urinary calcium levels, which suggest hypercalciuria. The most common type of kidney stone is a calcium stone, and medications used to prevent recurrent calcium stones target the distal convoluted tubule, which is responsible for calcium reabsorption. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) distal convoluted tubule."
