The symptoms, including cyanosis and high COHb levels, suggest that the most likely cause of the patient's condition is carbon monoxide poisoning. Anemic hypoxia is caused by a loss of functional hemoglobin or erythrocytes, but the patient has a normal hemoglobin level. Diffusion-limited hypoxia occurs when there is a decreased diffusion capacity of the lungs, but the patient has normal oxygen saturation levels. Methemoglobinemia is characterized by a shift in the oxygen dissociation curve, resulting in inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues, but the patient's COHb levels are elevated, not methemoglobin levels."

The normal pulse oximeter reading is because carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin and displaces oxygen, leading to hypoxia despite normal pulse oximetry readings. The arterial blood gas results show elevated levels of COHb, confirming the diagnosis. Anemic hypoxia is caused by decreased hemoglobin levels, while diffusion-limited hypoxia is caused by impaired gas exchange within the lungs. Methemoglobinemia is an uncommon condition caused by abnormal hemoglobin that is unable to bind to oxygen."

The normal pulse oximetry saturation can be explained by the fact that COHb interferes with pulse oximetry readings. The ABG results for the teenager include an elevated COHb level, confirming the diagnosis. Anemic hypoxia is caused by a reduction in the total amount of oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Diffusion-limited hypoxia occurs when there is a problem with the diffusion of oxygen from the alveoli to the blood. Methemoglobinemia is a condition where hemoglobin is unable to bind and release oxygen properly, but it is not associated with cyanosis."
