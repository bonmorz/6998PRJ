REM rebound (option B) refers to an increase in REM sleep after a period of sleep deprivation, which is not applicable in this scenario."

It can also increase the frequency of awakenings during the night. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because alcohol use can cause an initial increase in stage N1 sleep, but it eventually decreases overall sleep quality. Option (B) is incorrect because alcohol withdrawal can cause REM rebound, but alcohol use itself inhibits REM sleep. Option (D) is incorrect because alcohol use reduces the amount of total REM sleep."
