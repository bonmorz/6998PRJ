An inotropic agent increases the force and velocity of myocardial contraction, leading to a decrease in the interval between S1 and S2 heart sounds (option A).

Option C is incorrect because a decrease in the interval between S2 and S1 heart sounds would indicate a shorter diastolic phase, which is also not the desired outcome. Option D is incorrect because an inotropic agent would typically increase left ventricular end-diastolic pressure due to increased filling."

Inotropic agents are used to increase cardiac output and contractility, which would result in a decrease in the interval between heart sounds S1 and S2 as the heart contracts more efficiently. An increase in left ventricular end-systolic volume (option B) would be a negative response as it would indicate worsening heart function. A decrease in the interval between heart sounds S2 and S1 (option C) is not a likely response to inotropic agents.

Inotropic agents, such as dobutamine, increase the contractility of the heart muscle, leading to an increase in stroke volume and cardiac output.
