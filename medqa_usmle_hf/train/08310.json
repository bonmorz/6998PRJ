Test C has both the highest sensitivity and specificity, making it the best initial screening test. Test A has the highest specificity but a lower sensitivity than Test C. Test B has a higher sensitivity than Test A but a lower specificity, making it less desirable as an initial screening test. Therefore, the best testing scheme would be to use Test C on the entire student body and then follow up with Test A on those who test positive with Test C. This testing scheme would minimize the number of false positives while capturing the highest number of correct HIV diagnoses. Answer choice (C) is the correct answer."

Sensitivity refers to the proportion of true positive results among those who actually have the condition, while specificity refers to the proportion of true negative results among those who do not have the condition. The goal of the screening program is to capture as many correct HIV diagnoses as possible with the fewest false positives. In other words, the program should have high sensitivity to correctly identify those who have HIV, and high specificity to minimize false positives. \n\nAfter comparing the sensitivity and specificity of the available tests, the best testing scheme for the program would be to use Test C on the entire student body, followed by Test A on those who test positive on the first test. This is because Test C has the highest sensitivity (0.98) of the three tests, meaning it is more likely to detect HIV in those who have it. However, it has a slightly lower specificity (0.93) compared to the other tests, which means that there may be some false positives. To address this, those who test positive on Test C should be further screened with Test A, which has a higher specificity (0.99) and is less likely to produce false positive results. This testing scheme is the best balance between sensitivity and specificity, and will help capture the most correct diagnoses while minimizing false positives."

This combination takes advantage of Test C's high sensitivity to capture as many true HIV positive cases as possible in the initial screening, while minimizing false positives with its high specificity. Then, Test A is used for confirmation since it has the highest sensitivity among all tests, ensuring that the confirmed cases are true positives. Therefore, the answer is (C)."
