Colonoscopy is the most appropriate next step in management, as it can diagnose and potentially treat any colonic lesions. Flexible sigmoidoscopy may be useful in patients with symptoms restricted to the sigmoid colon, but due to the patient\u2019s symptoms involving the whole colon, colonoscopy is the preferred test. D-xylose absorption test and CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast have no role in the diagnosis or management of this patient\u2019s symptoms."
