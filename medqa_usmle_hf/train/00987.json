The high indirect bilirubin levels indicate an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is commonly seen in physiologic neonatal jaundice. The next step in management would be phototherapy which helps break down the bilirubin under the skin to a water-soluble form that can be excreted through urine and stools. Intravenous immunoglobulin is used for hemolytic disease of the newborn, not in physiologic jaundice. Increasing breastfeeding frequency is a good option, but it's not the most appropriate management because the baby needs to be under intense phototherapy to lower the bilirubin levels as soon as possible. MRI of the brain can be considered if the baby has excessive jaundice and/or elevated bilirubin levels, but it's not necessary for managing physiologic jaundice."
