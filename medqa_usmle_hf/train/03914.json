It is important to provide tetanus prophylaxis if the patient has not received one in the last 5-10 years. The most appropriate next step is to apply a moist sterile dressing and administer tetanus vaccine. Antibiotics may be necessary based on the severity of the wound, but there is no indication for prophylactic use in this case. Surgical treatment may be necessary in certain cases, but it is not the first-line option for this patient."
