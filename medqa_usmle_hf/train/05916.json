Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione medication that works on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) to increase insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake. PPAR-\u03b3 is mainly expressed in adipose tissue, and its activation leads to increased transcription of adipokines, which can improve insulin sensitivity. Thus, the most likely cellular change is increased transcription of adipokines. The other options are not related to PPAR-\u03b3 or the mechanisms of pioglitazone."
