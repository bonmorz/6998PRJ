The patient is presenting with lower back pain and fatigue, which increases with activity, along with anemia, elevated serum calcium, and bone lesions on imaging, which are all consistent with multiple myeloma. Metastatic prostatic cancer can also cause bone lesions, but typically presents with urinary symptoms as well. Secondary hyperparathyroidism may also cause elevated serum calcium, but does not typically present with bone lesions.

The low hemoglobin, normal leukocyte count, and high calcium level suggest a hematologic malignancy. The presence of multiple low-density lesions in the bones indicated bone involvement. Among the options, only Multiple myeloma fits both criteria. Metastatic prostatic cancer could also cause bone lesions but typically presents with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Secondary hyperparathyroidism typically presents with elevations in PTH and alkaline phosphatase levels. Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia presents with elevated serum viscosity and immunoglobulin M levels."
