The scenario describes the patient having an accessory atrioventricular conduction pathway, which can cause atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The administration of verapamil can worsen this condition and lead to cardiac arrest, a condition known as ventricular fibrillation. Prior to onset of symptoms, electrocardiography would most likely have shown a slurred upstroke of the QRS complex (delta wave) in the presence of a shortened PR interval, indicating Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a common cause of accessory pathways. This finding is not listed as an option, but it is the most likely finding to be seen on electrocardiography."

The slurred upstroke of the QRS complex is characteristic of delta waves, which are caused by the accessory pathway. Epsilon waves following the QRS complex are seen in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. Prolongation of the QT interval is seen in long QT syndrome. Positive Sokolow-Lyon index measures the combined amplitude of the S wave in V1 and the R wave in V5 or V6 on electrocardiography and is indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy."
