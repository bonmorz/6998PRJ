The high levels of N-terminal parathyroid hormone suggest primary hyperparathyroidism, which can lead to an increase in 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol synthesis. Option (B) is incorrect because ergocalciferol is not produced in humans. Option (C) is incorrect as 7-dehydrocholesterol is not involved in the active form of vitamin D synthesis. Option (D) is incorrect as 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol is not the active form of vitamin D."

The patient has hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism, suggesting an increase in 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, the active form of vitamin D. This is converted from 25-hydroxycholecalciferol through the action of 1\u03b1-hydroxylase in the kidneys, which is stimulated by parathyroid hormone. Options B and C involve the conversion of precursor forms of vitamin D to 25-hydroxyvitamin D, while option D involves the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to an inactive metabolite."
