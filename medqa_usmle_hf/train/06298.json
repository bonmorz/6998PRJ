The non-blanching skin lesions are suggestive of purpura, which is caused by bleeding into the skin due to a variety of causes, including viral infections like chronic hepatitis C. Hemangiomas are typically red or blue and are caused by an overgrowth of blood vessels, while petechiae are smaller than purpura and measure less than 3 mm in size. Spider angiomas are characterized by a central red spot with radiating spiderlike legs and are typically associated with liver disease."
