The patient\u2019s symptoms and lab results suggest that he has obstructive jaundice, and the CT scan shows strictures in the bile ducts leading to atypical bile duct cells. The biopsy confirms idiopathic inflammatory scarring of the bile duct, which is also known as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). PSC is a chronic, progressive disease of the bile ducts and is considered an autoimmune disorder. Liver fluke infection can also cause strictures in the bile ducts, leading to cholangiocarcinoma, but the patient\u2019s travel history suggests that this is not the case here. Long-term effects of contrast agents and abnormal cystic dilation of the biliary tree are not the known predisposing factors for PSC."
