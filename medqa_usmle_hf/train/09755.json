One of the key features of nephrotic syndrome is decreased oncotic pressure in the glomerulus, leading to increased filtration of plasma proteins. This increase in filtration results in proteinuria and edema. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) decreased glomerular oncotic pressure."

The symptoms and findings are consistent with nephrotic syndrome, which is marked by proteinuria, edema, and a foamy appearance of urine. Glomerular podocyte foot effacement, seen on electron microscopy, is indicative of minimal change disease, a type of nephrotic syndrome commonly seen in children. One of the hallmarks of nephrotic syndrome is a decrease in glomerular oncotic pressure, leading to an increase in glomerular filtration rate. Therefore, the correct answer is (A), decreased glomerular oncotic pressure. None of the other options are associated with an increase in glomerular filtration rate."

Therefore, the correct answer is (A), decreased glomerular oncotic pressure.

The patient\u2019s symptoms and test results suggest nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by proteinuria, edema, and hypoalbuminemia. In nephrotic syndrome, there is a decrease in glomerular oncotic pressure due to loss of albumin in the urine, leading to an increase in glomerular filtration rate. This can explain the foamy urine and puffy face seen in the patient. Increased hydrostatic pressure in the Bowman's capsule, decreased hydrostatic pressure in the Bowman's capsule, and decreased oncotic pressure in the Bowman's capsule may lead to decreased glomerular filtration rate."

The presented symptoms suggest nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by proteinuria, edema, and increase in glomerular filtration rate. Option (A) is correct as decreased glomerular oncotic pressure (caused by loss of albumin in the urine) allows for more filtration to occur, leading to an increased glomerular filtration rate. Option (B) and (C) are incorrect as they relate to changes in pressure in Bowman's capsule, which is not relevant to the increased filtration rate. Option (D) is incorrect as decreased oncotic pressure in the Bowman's capsule would actually decrease the filtration rate by reducing the reabsorption of filtered fluid."
