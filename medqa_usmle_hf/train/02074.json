However, the patient is also experiencing dyspareunia and post-coital spotting, indicating vaginal atrophy. While vaginal estradiol gel may be helpful for vaginal atrophy, the patient may also benefit from hormone replacement therapy to treat her overall hormonal imbalance. Since the patient has Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, it would be appropriate to monitor her thyroid levels, but increasing levothyroxine dose is unlikely to correct her menstrual irregularities. The patient\u2019s testosterone level is within the normal range, so prescribing combined oral contraceptives, which contain androgenic progestins, would not be helpful. Therefore, the best next step in management would be estradiol patch with oral medroxyprogesterone to both treat her vaginal atrophy and overall hormonal imbalance."

The elevated FSH level and low estradiol levels suggest ovarian failure. The best next step in management would be hormone replacement therapy, which can be achieved with an estradiol patch combined with oral medroxyprogesterone. Vaginal estradiol gel and combined oral contraceptive are also possible options, but the estradiol patch combined with oral medroxyprogesterone is most appropriate for the patient\u2019s symptoms and lab values. Increasing levothyroxine would not address the underlying issue."
