The lesions on the patient\u2019s penis and scrotum, as well as his recent unprotected sexual encounter, suggest a sexually transmitted infection. Among the options, Klebsiella granulomatis causes characteristic lesions that are painless nodules. Herpes simplex virus causes painful blisters, Haemophilus ducreyi causes painful ulcers, and Chlamydia trachomatis rarely causes visible lesions. Therefore, the answer is (A) Klebsiella granulomatis."
