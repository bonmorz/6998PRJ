Cow milk protein allergy may present with vomiting and diarrhea but it is less likely to cause abdominal rigidity, distention, and absent bowel sounds."

The symptoms suggest Necrotizing enterocolitis, which is most common in premature infants and those with low birth weight, like this patient. The fact that she has fed less, has decreased urine output, and has positive occult blood in the stool, along with the abdominal rigidity, distention, absent bowel sounds, and gas within the intestinal wall and peritoneal cavity seen on the x-ray all support this diagnosis. Meckel diverticulum usually presents with painless rectal bleeding. Cow milk protein allergy presents with gastroesophageal reflux, colic, and diarrhea.

The infant has symptoms consistent with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), including fever, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as abdominal rigidity, distention, and absent bowel sounds. The positive test for occult blood and the x-ray findings of gas within the intestinal wall and peritoneal cavity also support the diagnosis of NEC. Meckel diverticulum is a congenital abnormality that can cause intestinal obstruction, but it usually presents with lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Cow milk protein allergy can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, but it is not typically associated with abdominal rigidity and absent bowel sounds. Hirschsprung disease is a congenital disorder characterized by a absence of ganglion cells in the colon, but it usually presents with constipation rather than diarrhea."
