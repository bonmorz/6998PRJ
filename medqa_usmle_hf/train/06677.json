The symptoms and history suggest germinal matrix hemorrhage, which is a common cause of seizures and lethargy in premature infants. The bulging anterior fontanelle and decreased muscle tone are also consistent with this diagnosis. Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase deficiency causes galactosemia, which presents with vomiting, poor feeding, and jaundice. Congenital hydrocephalus causes an enlarged head, irritability, and poor feeding. Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency causes intellectual disability and seizures, but symptoms typically do not appear until after the newborn period."
