Among the options, fibrin formation in Bowman space is the most likely to cause acute tubular necrosis. Segmental collapse of glomerular capillaries can cause glomerular sclerosis, while effacement of podocyte foot processes is associated with minimal change disease and some types of glomerulonephritis. Deposition of immunoglobulin light chains is associated with light chain deposition disease."
