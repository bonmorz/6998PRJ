The symptoms and laboratory findings suggest an aplastic crisis, which is a complication of sickle cell anemia characterized by a sudden fall in red blood cell count. The attempted bone marrow biopsy which came back  a dry, empty tap is also consistent with aplastic crisis. Anemia of chronic disease typically has a normal or elevated reticulocyte count. Reaction to blood transfusions is unlikely as the patient regularly receives them without issue. Sequestration crisis is characterized by a sudden pooling of blood in the spleen and liver, leading to anemia, but is more common in younger children."

The patient's symptoms are consistent with aplastic crisis, which is a temporary reduction in red blood cell production that can occur in patients with sickle cell anemia. The low hemoglobin and dry, empty bone marrow biopsy indicate decreased erythropoiesis. Hydroxyurea and blood transfusions can also increase the risk of aplastic crisis. Anemia of chronic disease typically presents with normocytic anemia and elevated inflammatory markers, and sequestration crisis usually presents with rapid enlargement of the spleen and drop in hemoglobin. A reaction to blood transfusions would not explain the bone marrow findings."
