Option B is the most appropriate next step in management, as the patient is stable and the subcapsular splenic hematoma is small and not actively bleeding.

Laparoscopic splenectomy or splenectomy via laparotomy would be indicated if the patient deteriorates or if there is evidence of active bleeding. Coil embolization of short gastric vessels may be considered in certain cases, but is not typically used as a first-line intervention."
