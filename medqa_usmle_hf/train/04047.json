The stone is located in a duct that runs anterior to the masseter muscle and passes through the buccinator muscle, which suggests that it is in the parotid gland duct. Sialoendoscopy is used to remove a stone from the salivary gland duct, and it is typically inserted laterally to the second upper molar tooth to access the parotid gland duct. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."
