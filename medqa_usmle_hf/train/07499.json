The weakness of left foot dorsiflexion and reduced sensation over the dorsum of the left foot suggest a problem with the common fibular nerve, which innervates the muscles that dorsiflex the ankle and extend the toes. Normal foot eversion and weak hip flexion would be unrelated to this nerve. Decreased ankle jerk reflex is associated with the Achilles tendon which is innervated by the tibial nerve, not the common fibular nerve. The common fibular nerve also innervates the muscles that allow for foot inversion, so a normal foot inversion result is most likely."

The symptoms, including weakness of left foot dorsiflexion and reduced sensation over the web space between the 1st and 2nd digit, suggest a neuropathy involving the superficial peroneal nerve. Normal foot eversion and weak hip flexion are not characteristic of this condition. Decreased ankle jerk reflex may be seen in some neuropathies, but it is not specific for this condition. Normal foot inversion is the most likely finding as the deep peroneal nerve, which innervates the muscles for foot inversion, is not affected in this condition."

The symptoms suggest a left-sided common peroneal nerve injury, which innervates the muscles for foot dorsiflexion and foot eversion. Since foot eversion is normal, it rules out option (B). Decreased ankle jerk reflex and weak hip flexion are not expected in common peroneal nerve injury. However, since the nerve also innervates the muscles for foot inversion, a possible finding is normal foot inversion. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer."

The patient's weakness when lifting the left leg suggests a problem with the muscles or nerves responsible for dorsiflexion. Reduced sensation over the dorsum of the left foot suggests a nerve problem rather than a muscle problem. Normal foot eversion and weak hip flexion are not related to the symptoms, but normal foot inversion is necessary for dorsiflexion, so it is likely that further evaluation will show a problem with foot inversion. Decreased ankle jerk reflex may be present but is not specific to this condition."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest that there is a problem with the common fibular nerve, which supplies the muscles that dorsiflex and evert the foot, as well as the skin on the anterior lower leg and dorsum of the foot. Therefore, option (A) decreased ankle jerk reflex can be ruled out as it tests the function of the tibial nerve. The everters are also supplied by the fibular nerve, so option (B) normal foot eversion can also be ruled out. The inverters are supplied by the tibial nerve, so option (D) weak hip flexion can also be ruled out. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) normal foot inversion, which is also supplied by the tibial nerve."
