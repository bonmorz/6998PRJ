The most likely adaptation is a decreased oxygen binding ability of hemoglobin, which allows for better oxygen uptake at high altitudes where the air pressure is lower. Decreased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and decreased red blood cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate are not adaptations to high altitude. Decreased pulmonary vascular resistance is an adaptation seen in people with chronic hypoxia due to pulmonary disease, not in people at high altitudes."

The question is asking about the adaptation of the mountain-dwelling brother, which implies that he has undergone changes to adapt to high altitudes. At high altitudes, the air pressure is lower and there is less oxygen available. The body adapts by increasing levels of erythropoietin, which leads to higher red blood cell counts and hemoglobin levels. However, this increases the oxygen binding ability of hemoglobin, making it harder to release oxygen to tissues. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) decreased oxygen binding ability of hemoglobin."
