The presence of jaundice and hepatomegaly suggest cholestasis. PAS-positive, diastase-resistant cytoplasmic granules are characteristic of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which can present with liver disease and pulmonary emphysema in children. Feathery degeneration is seen in alcoholic liver disease. Widespread positive staining with Prussian blue is seen in hemochromatosis. Extensive Congo-red positive cytoplasmic drops are seen in amyloidosis, which is not associated with liver disease or pulmonary emphysema. Therefore, the correct answer is (A)."
