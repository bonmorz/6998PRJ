Despite this deficiency, B lymphocytes can still produce normal amounts of \u03bc and \u03b4 heavy chains, which form the antigen-binding site of immunoglobulins.

A deficiency in CD40L leads to X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome, where B cells cannot undergo class switching and therefore produce mainly IgM. IgM is made up of \u03bc and \u03b4 heavy chains, which means that these chains would still be expressed normally in this patient\u2019s B lymphocytes despite the CD40L deficiency.

CD40L is a protein involved in T-cell activation of B cells, and its deficiency can lead to X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome, a primary immunodeficiency. In this syndrome, B cells cannot class switch and produce IgM instead of other immunoglobulins. However, B cells still express normal levels of \u03bc and \u03b4 heavy chains, which are crucial for IgM production. Option (B) is incorrect because B cells do not express an \u03b5 heavy chain.

CD40L deficiency affects class switching and somatic hypermutation in B cells, but does not affect the initial formation of the B cell receptor complex. The B cell receptor complex consists of a membrane-bound immunoglobulin molecule, which is composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. The heavy chains can be either \u03bc, \u03b4, \u03b3, \u03b1, or \u03b5. The missing CD40L affects class switching, which allows a B cell to switch from producing IgM to producing other isotypes (e.g. IgG or IgA). However, this does not affect the formation of the B cell receptor, so the \u03bc and \u03b4 heavy chains would still be expressed normally."
