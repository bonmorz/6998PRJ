Based on the clinical presentation and chest x-ray findings, the most likely diagnosis is a left-sided pleural effusion. A decreased glucose concentration in the pleural fluid is a characteristic finding in exudative pleural effusions, which are commonly caused by pneumonia. Increased lymphocyte concentration is typical of lymphocytic pleural effusions, often seen in tuberculosis or viral infections, but is not the most likely finding in this case. Increased pH and increased triglyceride concentration are characteristic of chylous and pseudochylous effusions, respectively, but are not likely to be present in this case of pneumonia-associated pleural effusion."
