The child\u2019s medical history and laboratory evaluation indicate autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1), which is characterized by the failure of self-tolerance. Negative selection is the process by which developing T cells and B cells with high-affinity receptors for self-antigens are eliminated before they can mature and leave the thymus or bone marrow. Therefore, the most likely mechanism that failed in the child is negative selection."

Positive selection refers to the process of selecting T cells with receptors that can recognize self-MHC molecules. Inhibition of the inactivation of harmful lymphocytes by regulatory T cells and deletion of mature lymphocytes are not specifically related to the failure of immunological tolerance in APS-1."

The child's condition suggests an autoimmune disorder and his history of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, autoimmune hypoparathyroidism, and the presence of antibodies to 21-hydroxylase and a mutation in the AIRE (autoimmune regulator) gene all suggest that he has a failure of immunological tolerance. Negative selection is the elimination of self-reactive T cells during development in the thymus, and failure of negative selection could lead to autoimmune disorders. Positive selection is the survival of T cells that recognize self-antigens presented in the thymus with low affinity, and is not likely to be the mechanism that has failed in this patient. Inhibition of the inactivation of harmful lymphocytes by regulatory T cells and the deletion of mature lymphocytes may also play a role in maintaining immune tolerance, but negative selection failure is the most likely cause in this case."
