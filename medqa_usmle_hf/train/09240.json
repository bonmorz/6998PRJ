The equation is [Na+] \u2013 ([Cl-] + [HCO3-]) = 26, which is within the normal range (12-16), indicating no anion gap metabolic acidosis.

The high respiratory rate may be due to the altered mental status or a compensatory response to acidosis. The anion gap metabolic acidosis may be caused by lactic acidosis due to shock or sepsis, or toxic ingestion. It is important to identify and treat the underlying cause of the acid-base disorder."
