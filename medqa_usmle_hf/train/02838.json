The patient\u2019s statement that he wants to use his father\u2019s licensed firearm to \u201cend his misery\u201d is a clear indication of suicidal ideation and warrants immediate intervention. Involuntary hospitalization is necessary to ensure the patient\u2019s safety and treatment. Reassuring the patient that he will feel better is not appropriate in this situation as he has expressed suicidal ideation. Starting medication or outpatient psychotherapy is not safe or sufficient for the patient\u2019s level of acuity."

Reassuring the patient that he will feel better is not appropriate in this situation, as it does not address the underlying mental health issues.

In this case, the priority is to prevent harm to the patient (in this case, self-harm). Therefore, involuntary hospitalization is the most appropriate next step in management. The patient needs to be evaluated and treated in a safe and controlled environment, and the parents must be informed of the situation. Other treatment options, such as medication and psychotherapy, can be considered once the patient is stabilized and safe. Reassuring the patient that he will feel better is not an appropriate response, as it does not address the severity of his symptoms and suicidal ideation."
