The premature birth and maternal poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus are risk factors for IRDS. Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is possible but not as likely given the severity of presentation and ABG results.

The newborn\u2019s gestational age of 33 weeks, maternal poorly controlled diabetes, and decreased breath sounds suggest Infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), which is caused by inadequate surfactant production due to immature lung development. This is further supported by the arterial blood gas results, which indicate respiratory acidosis due to inadequate gas exchange. Transient tachypnea of the newborn and meconium aspiration syndrome may present with similar symptoms and signs, but do not typically have decreased breath sounds. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a constellation of physical and developmental abnormalities due to alcohol exposure in utero and would not be the cause of the newborn\u2019s respiratory distress."

The newborn presents with clinical features consistent with Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome (IRDS), including tachypnea, nasal flaring, subcostal retractions, and decreased breath sounds. The arterial blood gas results show severe respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia. This condition is commonly seen in premature infants born at less than 34 weeks of gestation and is caused by a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant. Transient tachypnea of the newborn is another cause of respiratory distress in newborns, but it is typically seen in term and late-preterm infants and is self-limiting. Meconium aspiration syndrome is characterized by respiratory distress in the neonate due to the inhalation of meconium during delivery. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a constellation of physical, behavioral, and cognitive abnormalities caused by exposure to alcohol in utero and is not the most likely diagnosis in this case."

Transient tachypnea of the newborn is caused by delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid and typically resolves within a few hours to a few days after birth. Meconium aspiration syndrome is caused by aspiration of meconium-stained amniotic fluid during fetal distress and presents with respiratory distress, tachypnea, and cyanosis. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a constellation of physical and neurocognitive symptoms caused by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and typically does not present with respiratory distress."
