Plasmids are small DNA molecules that are separate from the chromosome and can carry genes for antibiotic resistance. If a bacterium loses its antibiotic resistance plasmid, it can become sensitive to that antibiotic again. The other options (point mutation, loss of function mutation, viral infection) are less likely to result in the loss of antibiotic resistance."

Plasmids are small, circular DNA molecules that can be transferred between bacteria and often carry antibiotic resistance genes. It is possible that some of the bacteria in the liquid culture lost the plasmid containing the vancomycin resistance gene, leading to their sensitivity to the antibiotic. Point mutations and loss of function mutations can also lead to antibiotic resistance, but they are less likely to revert back to sensitivity after only 15 generations. Viral infection is not a likely mechanism for this scenario."
