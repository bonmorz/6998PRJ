The sudden, bilateral, painful loss of vision, along with the patient's history of peripheral neuropathy, suggests multiple sclerosis (MS). The decreased sensation in her fingers bilaterally and urinary incontinence support this diagnosis. An MRI may not initially show any lesions in cases of MS, and a CT scan is not useful in diagnosing MS. A urine toxicology panel is also not useful in diagnosing MS. A lumbar puncture to test for oligoclonal bands, which are present in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with MS, is the next best step in management for this patient."
