The patient's concern about her inability to get pregnant for the past year and regular menstrual cycles suggests infertility. Her husband's sperm count is normal, so performing a hysterosalpingogram is the most appropriate next step to assess if there are any structural issues with the fallopian tubes or uterus that may be hindering conception. Option A is not appropriate as the patient has not yet undergone infertility testing. Option B may be used to determine ovulation, but it does not address potential structural issues. Option C may be appropriate if infertility testing has not been performed, but if testing has already been done, further management is necessary."

The patient has been actively trying to conceive for a year, and the husband\u2019s sperm count is within normal range, indicating that there might be an issue with the patient\u2019s fallopian tubes or uterus. Therefore, performing a hysterosalpingogram is necessary to assess if the patient\u2019s fallopian tubes are blocked or if there are any issues with her uterus. Advise against pregnancy given the patient's age is not appropriate as age alone does not preclude pregnancy. Assessing ovulation with an ovulation calendar and continuing regular intercourse for 1 year are interventions for patients who are actively trying to conceive, but in this case, further diagnostic testing is necessary."
