The patient is presenting with symptoms of bronchiolitis, and most cases can be diagnosed based on clinical presentation. No further testing is needed unless there is concern for a coexisting bacterial infection. Polymerase chain reaction and viral culture may be ordered in severe cases or if there is suspicion for a specific viral etiology. A sputum culture is not appropriate in this case as the patient is too young to produce a reliable sputum sample."

Testing may be considered if there is concern for a different diagnosis, such as bacterial pneumonia or pertussis, but this question does not provide any indication of such concerns."
