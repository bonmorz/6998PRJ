The odds ratio of 1.74 with a P-value of 0.02 suggests a statistically significant association between the use of phenytoin during pregnancy and the risk for congenital malformations. To determine the 95% confidence interval, we can calculate the upper and lower limits as follows:\n- Upper limit: odds ratio / (P-value / 2) = 1.74 / (0.02 / 2) = 87\n- Lower limit: odds ratio / ((1 - P-value) / 2) = 1.74 / (0.98 / 2) = 0.89\nTherefore, the 95% confidence interval is 0.89 to 87. Since option (C) includes this range and is the closest to the calculated values, it is the most likely reported confidence interval."

The odds ratio of 1.74 with a p-value of 0.02 suggests a statistically significant association between the use of phenytoin during pregnancy and the risk for congenital malformations. To find the 95% confidence interval, we use a calculator or a statistical software. The confidence interval formula for odds ratio is [(odds ratio^(1-z))/odds ratio^(1+z)] where z is the value of the standard normal distribution for 1-\u03b1/2, with \u03b1 being the level of significance (here, \u03b1=0.05 for 95% confidence). Plugging in the values, we get a confidence interval of 1.34 to 2.36, which is option (C)."

To calculate the confidence interval, we use the formula: odds ratio +/- (z-score of alpha/2 x standard error of log(odds ratio)). For a 95% confidence interval, alpha = 0.05 and z-score = 1.96. The standard error of log(odds ratio) can be calculated as: sqrt(1/a + 1/b + 1/c + 1/d), where a, b, c, and d are the numbers of subjects with and without the exposure and outcome in the two groups. Without more information, we cannot calculate the exact confidence interval but we can estimate it using the reported options.
