The patient has chronic renal failure which results in decreased 1,25(OH)-vitamin D, causing secondary hyperparathyroidism. The serum calcium level should be low due to decreased activation of vitamin D, leading to decreased calcium absorption in the gut and increased calcium loss in the urine. Options A and D are incorrect because they suggest elevated serum calcium levels, which do not occur in secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Option B is incorrect because it suggests elevated serum calcium levels, which do not occur in secondary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic renal failure."

This secondary hyperparathyroidism leads to bone resorption, osteopenia, and eventually fractures. However, the elevated PTH also increases calcium reabsorption from the kidneys, resulting in hypercalcemia. In this case, the 1,25(OH)-vitamin D is decreased, indicating the lack of active vitamin D, which goes along with secondary hyperparathyroidism. However, the serum calcium level is not elevated, indicating that the patient is still in the early stage of secondary hyperparathyroidism."
