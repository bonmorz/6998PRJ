A superficial mucosal tear in the distal esophagus is also known as a Mallory\u2013Weiss tear, which is often caused by excessive vomiting. Vomiting causes loss of acid and chloride in the stomach, leading to a metabolic alkalosis. Anemia and hypokalemia may contribute to acid/base disturbances, but they are not the most likely mechanisms in this case. Hepatic cirrhosis may cause a metabolic acidosis due to impaired clearance of acids by the liver, so it is also an unlikely option."
