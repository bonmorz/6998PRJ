The presence of RBC's and WBC's in the stool indicates an infection, and the non-lactose fermenting Gram-negative rods are likely to be Shigella or Campylobacter species. Both bacteria produce toxins that inhibit the 60S ribosome, leading to protein synthesis inhibition and cell death. Option B is incorrect since these bacteria do not typically lyse red blood cells. Option C is incorrect because inhibition of phagocytosis is a function of certain bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae. Option D is incorrect because it describes the action of botulinum toxin, not the toxins produced by these gram-negative rods."
