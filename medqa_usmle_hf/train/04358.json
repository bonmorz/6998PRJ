The patient has HIV-infection but the mutation prevents entry of HIV into macrophages, suggesting a mutation in the CCR5 protein. The other options are involved in the attachment or entry of HIV into host cells. The symptoms suggest the patient has Pneumocystis pneumonia, which is common in patients with HIV and a weakened immune system. The elevated level of beta-d-glucan can be used to diagnose Pneumocystis pneumonia."

The protein that is most commonly associated with this mutation is CCR5. Gp120 and CD4 are both involved in viral entry into the host cells, but they are not affected by this particular mutation.
