The patient\u2019s history of rheumatoid arthritis and palpable spleen tip on inspiration suggest Felty syndrome, which is characterized by the triad of rheumatoid arthritis, splenomegaly, and neutropenia. The leg ulcers may be a result of neutropenia, which impairs the body\u2019s ability to fight infections and leads to delayed wound healing. Venous stasis and valve insufficiency may cause leg ulcers, but the absence of varicose veins and scattered distribution of the ulcers make this less likely. Vitamin deficiency and Caplan syndrome are not associated with leg ulcers."
