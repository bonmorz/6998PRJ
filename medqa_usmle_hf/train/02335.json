Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin with greater affinity than oxygen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues. Inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase is the underlying cause of carbon monoxide poisoning, as it prevents the final step of electron transport, leading to decreased ATP production and cellular malfunction.

Option (A) is incorrect because inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase would lead to decreased ATP production, not the symptoms described. Option (B) is incorrect because inhibition of ATP synthase would also lead to decreased ATP production, not the symptoms described. Option (D) is incorrect because increased mitochondrial membrane permeability is not associated with carbon monoxide poisoning."
