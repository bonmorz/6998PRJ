The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with herpes zoster infection, which can cause post-herpetic neuralgia as a complication. This may result in sensory neuropathy, usually involving the affected dermatome. The immunosuppressive medications the patient is taking for his transplant increase his risk for herpes zoster infection. Urinary retention, loss of vision, and temporal lobe inflammation are not commonly associated complications of herpes zoster infection."
