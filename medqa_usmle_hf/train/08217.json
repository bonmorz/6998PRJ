The symptoms suggest sexual abuse, as the girl is exhibiting inappropriate sexual behavior and has recently experienced a significant change in living situation.

The behavior of the girl and the recent move to a low-income housing combined with the fact that she is too shy to reply to questions suggest that sexual abuse may be a possible diagnosis.
