The patient has a history of an X-linked recessive disorder that causes progressive proximal muscle weakness and gait abnormalities, which is consistent with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, caused by impaired connection of cytoskeletal actin filaments to membrane-bound dystroglycan. This condition can also lead to cardiomyopathy, which is likely the cause of the patient's cardiovascular symptoms, including the holosystolic murmur and elevated levels of brain natriuretic peptide. The other options are not associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy."
