The fact that the patient has a translocation t(15,17) and positive myeloperoxidase suggests that he has acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). APL is not associated with Down syndrome and does not arise from myelodysplastic syndromes. Treatment for APL includes a vitamin A derivative called all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Auer rods are found in the cytoplasm of the leukemic blasts in AML but are not responsible for gum hyperplasia and bleeding, which are more commonly associated with acute monocytic leukemia."
