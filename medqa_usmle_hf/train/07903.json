The patient also has a history of severe rash with cephalosporins, which rules out Clindamycin and Levofloxacin. Aztreonam is not typically used for urinary tract infections, and Tobramycin is commonly used to treat urinary tract infections caused by E. coli. The elevated serum creatinine suggests renal dysfunction, and Tobramycin is a commonly used antibiotic in patients with renal impairment. Therefore, the most likely antibiotic given to this patient is Tobramycin."
