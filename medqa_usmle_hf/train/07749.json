The CT scan shows an aortic dissection, a condition in which there is a tear in the inner lining of the aorta, the largest artery in the body. Among the options, hypertension is the strongest predisposing factor for aortic dissection, as it can cause weakening of the artery walls, making them more susceptible to tears or ruptures. The patient's history of smoking and hyperlipidemia are also risk factors, but hypertension is the strongest. There is no information provided to suggest a genetic collagen disorder as a predisposing factor. Age can also increase the risk of aortic dissection, but it is not as strong a factor as hypertension."
