Major depressive disorder is characterized by more severe and episodic symptoms, while Bipolar disorder and Schizoaffective disorder have additional symptoms such as manic or psychotic episodes. The patient's history of a previous pregnancy loss may also contribute to the development of Persistent depressive disorder."

Bipolar disorder involves episodes of both depression and mania or hypomania, and schizoaffective disorder involves a combination of psychotic symptoms and mood episodes. None of these diagnoses fit the patient's presentation as well as persistent depressive disorder."
