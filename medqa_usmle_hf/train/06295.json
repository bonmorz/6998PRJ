The best course of treatment for specific phobia is cognitive behavioral therapy, which involves exposure therapy to gradually reduce the patient's fear response to the phobic stimulus. While anxiolytics or antidepressants may be used to manage symptoms of anxiety or depression that may co-occur with specific phobia, they are not the primary treatment. Beta-blockers may be used to manage physical symptoms such as increased heart rate, but they do not address the underlying fear and avoidance behavior. Therefore, the best course of treatment for this patient would be cognitive behavioral therapy."
