The presence of a friction rub and a swollen, erythematous, and indurated right calf points to deep vein thrombosis. These two conditions put the patient at risk of increased dead space, which is the most likely lung status in this case. Creation of a shunt would be evident in cyanosis or low arterial oxygen saturation, hypoventilation would lead to an increase in carbon dioxide levels in the body, and obstructive lung disease would manifest as difficulty exhaling."

The swollen and erythematous calf is also a common sign of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism."

The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath and left-sided back pain, along with the presence of a friction rub in the left lung base and a swollen and erythematous right calf, suggest the possibility of pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism can lead to increased dead space, as blood flow is diverted away from the affected area of the lung. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because a shunt would cause blood to bypass the lungs altogether, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Option (B) is not likely because the patient is experiencing shortness of breath, which suggests increased respiratory effort rather than hypoventilation. Option (D) is not likely because there is no evidence of obstructive lung disease on physical exam."
