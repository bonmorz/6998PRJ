The symptoms and laboratory studies suggest that insufficient mechanical hemostasis is the most likely cause of the patient's bleeding. The midline incision has severe oozing of blood from its margins and the colostomy bag has some blood collected within, indicating that there is not enough mechanical pressure to stop the bleeding. Liver dysfunction, platelet dysfunction, and factor VIII deficiency can all cause bleeding, but the laboratory studies do not support these diagnoses."
