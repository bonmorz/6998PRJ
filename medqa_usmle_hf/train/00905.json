Electrolyte abnormalities can also cause confusion, but the patient\u2019s recent medication changes are a more likely cause.

The patient has a complex medical history and is taking multiple medications, which increases the likelihood of a medication complication.

The patient running out of oxycodone and clonazepam could also contribute to his agitation and confusion. Bacterial and viral infections could cause confusion, but the absence of other symptoms makes this less likely as the primary etiology. While electrolyte abnormalities can cause confusion, hyperreflexia and clonus suggest a medication complication rather than electrolyte imbalances."

Other possible medication complications include withdrawal from oxycodone and clonazepam. Bacterial and viral infections, as well as electrolyte abnormalities, cannot be ruled out without further testing, but medication complication is the most likely cause based on the patient's medication history and recent medication changes."
