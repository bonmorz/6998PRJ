The ability to blink and move the eyes in the vertical plane suggests that the midbrain and pons are still functional, but the higher cortical and motor areas are affected. Anterior cerebral artery, anterior inferior cerebellar artery, and posterior cerebral artery occlusions would result in different neurological deficits."
