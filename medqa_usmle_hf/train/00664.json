The x-ray of the chest supports this suspicion. Collecting sputum specimens for acid-fast bacilli smear microscopy, culture, and nucleic acid amplification is the most appropriate next step in management to confirm the diagnosis of tuberculosis. High-resolution CT scan of the chest may be useful if the diagnosis remains unclear after sputum testing. Transbronchial lung biopsy is not typically used for diagnosing tuberculosis, and interferon-gamma release assay is useful for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection but not active tuberculosis disease."
