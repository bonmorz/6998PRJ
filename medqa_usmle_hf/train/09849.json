Major depressive disorder requires 2 weeks of symptoms, and the patient denies suicidal ideation. Adjustment disorder would be more appropriate if the patient had a specific stressor other than losing her job. Drug-related depression is less likely since oral isotretinoin is used to treat acne, not depression."

Major depressive disorder requires more persistent and pervasive symptoms, while adjustment disorder is more specific to a stressor and does not have as severe symptoms. The patient\u2019s use of isotretinoin and decreased smoking may be contributing factors, but there is no clear indication that they are causing or exacerbating her symptoms."
