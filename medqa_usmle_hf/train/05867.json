Fanconi syndrome is a disorder of the proximal tubules of the kidney and leads to impaired reabsorption in the kidney, resulting in loss of important minerals including sodium, potassium, and calcium. Therefore, the most likely finding is hypocalcemia. None of the other options are associated with Fanconi syndrome."

The symptoms suggest that the patient may have osteomalacia, which is caused by a vitamin D deficiency resulting in decreased bone mineralization.
