The thermal injury is also indicative of decreased sensation. Option A (fusion of cervical vertebrae) may cause symptoms similar to those described but is caused by a congenital condition or surgery, which is not mentioned in the question stem. Option B (hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis) is a congenital condition that would not likely cause the symptoms described. Option D (cervical spinal epidural abscess) may cause neck pain and weakness but would not cause numbness or a thermal injury. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is a cavitation in the cervical spinal cord."
