The patient has a history of IV drug abuse and multiple admissions for septic shock, which puts him at risk for abscesses. The presence of a fever, abdominal pain, left upper quadrant tenderness, and a murmur over the left upper sternal border suggests the most likely diagnosis is splenic abscess. Diverticulitis can cause left lower quadrant pain, while hepatic abscess and mesenteric ischemia are less likely given the physical exam findings. The normal hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and elevated leukocyte count also support the diagnosis of a bacterial infection."

The patient has a history of IV drug abuse and septic shock, which puts him at high risk for the development of splenic abscess. His symptoms, including fever, worsening abdominal pain, and left upper quadrant tenderness, support this diagnosis. The murmur over the left upper sternal border may be indicative of endocarditis, which could be a possible source of the infection leading to the abscess. The laboratory values, including an elevated leukocyte count and normal hemoglobin and platelet counts, are supportive of an infectious etiology. Diverticulitis would not typically present with left upper quadrant tenderness, while hepatic abscess would usually be associated with right upper quadrant pain. Mesenteric ischemia would present with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, and may also cause elevations in lactate levels."
