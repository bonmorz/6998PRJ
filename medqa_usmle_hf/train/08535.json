The question is asking for the anticodon sequence of the tRNA that is charged with the amino acid targeted by the N-terminal peptidase. The key to answering the question lies in the fact that the radiolabeled amino acids only bind to the peptidyl and exit sites of the ribosome, indicating that they have already been added to the growing peptide chain. Therefore, the tRNA charged with the amino acid targeted by the peptidase must be in the P-site, which means that it must have an anticodon sequence that is complementary to the codon in the A-site. The only answer choice that corresponds to a codon in the A-site is (B) 5'-CAU-3', which codes for the amino acid histidine. Therefore, the tRNA charged with histidine must have the anticodon 5'-AUG-3'."

The question revolves around understanding the transfer RNA charged by the amino acid target of the N-terminal peptidase. The N-terminal peptidase cleaves proteins at the N-terminal end, which is usually the first methionine amino acid. Methionine is coded by AUG codon, which pairs with UAC anticodon on the initiator tRNA. Therefore, we can eliminate answer choices A, C, and D. The remaining option is B, which codes for histidine, another amino acid commonly found at the N-terminal end of proteins. The anticodon for histidine is CAU. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
