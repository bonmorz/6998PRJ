The elevated BUN and creatinine values indicate acute renal failure, which can be caused by dehydration-induced hypovolemia. The normal glucose and lack of fever make sepsis less likely, and there is no evidence of nephrolithiasis. NSAID use can cause acute renal failure but there is no history of such use, and urinary sodium levels indicate prerenal rather than intrinsic renal disease."
