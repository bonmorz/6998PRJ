The symptoms and physical examination findings suggest acute appendicitis, but the development of hepatic abscesses and elevated neutrophil count suggest a complication of pylephlebitis - a suppurative thrombophlebitis of the portal vein. This can occur as a complication of intra-abdominal infection, such as appendicitis. Intestinal obstruction, perforation, and appendiceal abscess are all possible complications of acute appendicitis, but are less likely based on the given information."

Two days later, a CT scan reveals new hepatic abscesses, so it is likely that the patient has experienced pylephlebitis, which is a complication of intra-abdominal infections that can lead to sepsis and liver abscesses. The high neutrophil count and left shift in the complete blood count further support the diagnosis of infection. Intestinal obstruction and perforation are less likely as the patient had severe tenderness on palpation but no evidence of peritonitis or obstruction on physical examination. Appendiceal abscess was treated with antibiotics, but new hepatic abscesses suggest a more severe complication."

The presentation of lower abdominal pain that shifts to the right lower quadrant along with severe tenderness on palpation and rebound tenderness suggests appendicitis. However, the decision was made to place the patient on antibiotics and defer surgery, indicating that there may have been a concern for complications. The subsequent development of hepatic abscesses and the elevated leukocyte count with a high percentage of neutrophils suggest the most likely complication is pylephlebitis, which is a rare but serious complication of appendicitis characterized by septic thrombophlebitis of the portal vein."

The patient initially presented with symptoms of appendicitis, but the decision was made to defer surgery and place him on antibiotics. Two days later, he has developed hepatic abscesses, which suggest the spread of infection through the portal vein, leading to pylephlebitis. The normal platelet count and absence of fecal vomiting or absence of air-fluid levels on abdominal radiography rule out intestinal obstruction and perforation, respectively. The increase in neutrophils and bands indicates an acute infection."
