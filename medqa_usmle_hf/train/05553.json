The patient's condition suggests type II diabetes mellitus, and the first-line oral pharmacologic agent is likely metformin. The mechanism of action of metformin involves inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis, limiting the amount of glucose produced by the liver. This can help improve blood glucose levels in patients with type II diabetes mellitus. Option A refers to thiazolidinediones, option B refers to sulfonylureas, and option C refers to alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, which are all alternative medications for diabetes but not the first-line choice."
