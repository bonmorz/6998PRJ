Colonoscopy can be helpful for investigating chronic diarrhea or gastrointestinal bleeding, but is not necessary at this point. Fecal occult blood test is also not helpful in the context of acute diarrhea. Stool ova and parasite testing may be considered if there is suspicion for parasitic infection, but it is not the primary test in this scenario."
