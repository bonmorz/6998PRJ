We know that the clearance of X is half that of inulin. Inulin is often used as a measure of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) because it is freely filtered at the glomerulus and is not reabsorbed or secreted along the tubules. So if the clearance of X is half that of inulin, then Cx = 0.5 x GFR. We also know that this patient's filtration fraction is 20%, which means that 20% of the plasma that enters the kidney is filtered at the glomerulus. Therefore, GFR = 0.2 x renal plasma flow (RPF), where RPF = (UPAH x V) / PPAH. Substituting the given values, we get RPF = (30 x 100) / 5 = 600 ml/min. Therefore, GFR = 0.2 x 600 = 120 ml/min. Since the clearance of X is half that of inulin, Cx = 0.5 x 120 = 60 ml/min. Therefore, the correct answer is (A)."
