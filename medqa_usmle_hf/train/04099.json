The question is asking for the mRNA change that would cause a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding muscle glycogen phosphorylase, leading to McArdle's disease. A nonsense mutation is a point mutation in which a codon that codes for an amino acid is changed to a stop codon, causing premature termination of polypeptide chain synthesis. Option D, UAU -> UAA, is a point mutation that changes the codon for tyrosine to a stop codon. This would cause premature termination of the polypeptide chain synthesis and lead to a dysfunctional or nonfunctional enzyme, resulting in McArdle's disease."

McArdle\u2019s disease is a glycogen storage disease caused by a mutation in the muscle glycogen phosphorylase gene, resulting in the absence of functional enzyme. A nonsense mutation involves a substitution of a normal triplet code with a stop codon, resulting in a shortened or truncated protein. Therefore, the expected mRNA change would be UAU -> UAA, which creates a premature stop codon. Option A involves a change that does not affect the amino acid sequence. Option B is a substitution of the start codon, which would affect translation initiation. Option C is a substitution of one amino acid for another, which may or may not cause an issue in protein function."
