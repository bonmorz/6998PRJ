Option A, ventricular wall aneurysm, can cause dyspnea but not a new murmur. Option B, restrictive pericarditis, can also cause dyspnea but not a new murmur.

A ventricular wall aneurysm may cause ischemia but would not cause the symptoms described. Restrictive pericarditis would cause dyspnea in most positions and would not cause a new murmur. Arrhythmia may cause dyspnea, but would not cause a new murmur or crackles on lung exam."
