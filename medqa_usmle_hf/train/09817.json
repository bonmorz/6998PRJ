The laboratory studies show normal platelet count and fibrinogen levels, ruling out hyperfibrinolysis. Chromosomal abnormalities are a common cause of miscarriage, but it cannot be determined solely based on the information provided. Subchorionic hematoma can cause vaginal bleeding, but the open cervical os suggests a different cause. Placental thrombosis, caused by thrombophilic disorders, is a common cause of fetal demise and miscarriage. Therefore, placental thrombosis is the most likely explanation for this patient's examination findings."
