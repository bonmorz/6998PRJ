The presence of electron dense granules within the lysosomes suggests a lysosomal storage disorder, and the family history of childhood onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy suggests Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type II). The enzyme responsible for degradation of glycogen within lysosomes is lysosomal alpha 1,4-glucosidase, so the correct answer is (B). Glucose-6-phosphatase is responsible for glycogenolysis in the liver and kidney, not lysosomal degradation. Debranching enzyme and branching enzyme are involved in glycogen synthesis and degradation within the cytoplasm, not lysosomes."
