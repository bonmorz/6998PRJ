The patient\u2019s presentation of decreased urine output, generalized edema, and elevated creatinine suggests decreased GFR, which is caused by efferent arteriole vasodilation. Option A is incorrect because vasodilation of the afferent arteriole would increase GFR. Option B is incorrect because efferent arteriole constriction would increase glomerular pressure and GFR, and this would not explain the patient\u2019s decreased urine output and edema. Option D is incorrect because efferent arteriole vasodilation would increase GFR, which is not consistent with the patient\u2019s presentation."
