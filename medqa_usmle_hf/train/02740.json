The patient presents with symptoms of postpartum headache, which could be related to postdural puncture headache (PDH) due to the epidural analgesia.

However, because the patient's neurological examination shows no other abnormalities, a coagulation panel and cerebrospinal fluid analysis may not be necessary. Continued bed rest may not be helpful in treating PDH. The most appropriate next step in management would be an epidural blood injection, which can help stop the cerebrospinal fluid leak and alleviate the headache."
