Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia involves the AV node, which is responsible for conducting the electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles. The length of the PR interval is the time taken for the electrical impulse to reach the ventricles after it has been generated in the atria. Therefore, this should be monitored during treatment as changes in this interval can indicate the success or failure of the treatment. QRS complex amplitude, length of QT interval, and length of QRS complex are not specifically related to AV nodal reentrant tachycardia and do not need to be monitored during treatment."
