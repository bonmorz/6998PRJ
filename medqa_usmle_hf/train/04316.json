The patient's recent camping trip to Kentucky, lung symptoms, and skin lesions are suggestive of Blastomycosis, a fungal infection commonly found in the Midwest and Southeastern United States. Sirolimus and prednisone are immunosuppressive medications that can increase the risk of fungal infections. The skin biopsy would confirm the presence of the fungus. Mucormycosis is a fungal infection that mainly affects immunocompromised patients and affects the sinuses, lungs, and brain, but does not typically present with skin lesions. Coccidioidomycosis and Cryptococcosis can also cause lung symptoms but do not typically present with skin lesions."

Mucormycosis affects immunocompromised patients but presents with necrosis rather than verrucous skin patches. Coccidioidomycosis and Cryptococcosis may also present with similar symptoms but not skin lesions like in the case of blastomycosis.
