Propranolol and Sertraline are first-line treatments for anxiety disorders but may not target the patient\u2019s specific symptoms, while Phenelzine is a second-line treatment for OCD."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest he has obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which is often treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Sertraline. However, since the patient\u2019s symptoms are still ineffective after eight weeks of use of the SSRI, adding a second-generation antipsychotic like Risperidone may help improve symptoms. Propranolol, a beta blocker, and Phenelzine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, may be used for anxiety, but they are not first-line treatments for OCD."
