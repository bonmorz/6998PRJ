Option A is the appropriate response in this situation, as the physician should explore the reasons behind the family's request to withhold information and engage in open and honest communication to ensure the patient is fully informed and involved in his care to the extent possible. While respecting the patient's autonomy is important, it is also important to act in the patient's best interest and provide guidance and support to help the family navigate difficult decisions. Bringing the situation to the hospital ethics panel may be necessary in certain cases, but it should not be the first or only step taken."

The physician should also emphasize the potential consequences of withholding information from the patient. Ultimately, the physician's duty is to act in the patient's best interest while respecting his autonomy. If the patient insists on not knowing his prognosis, the physician should explore alternative ways to support him and provide appropriate palliative care. It may be appropriate to involve an interpreter or cultural mediator to facilitate communication with the patient and his family. Bringing the situation to the hospital ethics panel should only be considered if there is an impasse in communication and decision-making, and all reasonable efforts to respect the patient's autonomy have been exhausted."
