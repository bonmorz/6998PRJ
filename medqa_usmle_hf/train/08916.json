The fact that the transvaginal ultrasound revealed an endometrial thickness of 4 mm supports this diagnosis, as endometrial hyperplasia is often associated with increased endometrial thickness. Endometrial carcinoma is a possibility but is less likely given the patient's age and negative Pap smear and HPV test. Uterine adenomyosis and endometrial polyps may also cause heavy bleeding, but they would typically present with other symptoms such as pelvic pain or discomfort, which the patient did not report."
