The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest diabetes insipidus, a condition where the body can\u2019t retain enough water due to a failure in ADH function caused by the surgery. This would lead to increased extracellular fluid osmolarity. Hyponatremia would be an opposite symptom, caused by too much water intake. Serum osmolarity would be elevated due to the lack of water retention. Elevated blood glucose is not related to fluid balance in this case."
