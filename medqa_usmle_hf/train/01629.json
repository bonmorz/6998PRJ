This bacterium is commonly associated with UTIs and is known to produce an enzyme that can hydrolyze urea, resulting in an increase in urine pH and the formation of struvite stones. The fact that the initial antibiotic treatment was not effective also supports the diagnosis of a UTI caused by Proteus mirabilis since this bacterium is known to have intrinsic resistance to certain antibiotics."

Since the symptoms have not improved after 48 hours of treatment, the physician may need to consider changing the antibiotic therapy."
