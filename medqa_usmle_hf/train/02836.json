The presence of an ulcerated genital lesion, non-exudative ulcer, and positive RPR and FTA-abs tests suggest syphilis infection. The patient's history of allergic reaction to amoxicillin should not be a contraindication for treating syphilis with penicillin, as the reactions are often not cross-reactive. Therefore, penicillin desensitization, followed by intra muscular benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units, is the recommended treatment for syphilis during pregnancy. Delaying treatment until delivery can cause severe complications for both the mother and the fetus. Tetracyclines are not recommended for use in pregnant women as they can cause fetal hepatic necrosis and permanent discoloration of teeth. Doxycycline is also not recommended in pregnant women as it can cause skeletal abnormalities in the fetus."
