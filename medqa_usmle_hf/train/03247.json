The fracture of the humerus may have resulted in compression of the brachial artery or ulnar nerve, but neither of these structures would cause diffuse bone necrosis. Epiphyseal plate is not present in adults. Volkmann's canal lies in the medial aspect of the humerus and is the pathway for the blood supply of the bone. Injury to Volkmann's canal can cause ischemia and subsequent necrosis of the bone. Therefore, the most likely cause of the diffuse bone necrosis is damage to the Volkmann's canal."

The only option that relates to the brachial artery is the Volkmann's canal, which is the passage through which the brachial artery enters the forearm. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."
