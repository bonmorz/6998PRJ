The patient has a history of antithrombin deficiency and chronic deep vein thrombosis, which puts her at increased risk of blood clots. The transdermal contraceptive patch is contraindicated in patients with a high risk of thrombosis due to the higher systemic exposure to estrogen compared to oral contraceptives. Therefore, the most detrimental form of contraception for this patient would be the transdermal contraceptive patch. Other options, such as Norethindrone or Copper IUD, would not increase the patient's risk of thrombosis. However, the Levonorgestrel IUD may not be the best option for a woman who has just given birth given the potential risk of uterine perforation. The patient should discuss the risks and benefits of different contraceptive options with her healthcare provider."
