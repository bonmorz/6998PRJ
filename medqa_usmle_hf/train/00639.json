The screening blood test used in this situation is the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), which is used to diagnose latent tuberculosis infection. The peptides added to the sample specifically stimulate the production of interferon-gamma by T cells that have been sensitized to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The other options are not associated with sensitivity to interferon-gamma and would not be helpful in diagnosing infection using this test."
