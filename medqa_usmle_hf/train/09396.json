The symptoms of numbness in fingertips and around the lips, as well as carpopedal spasms and positive Chvostek sign, suggest hypocalcemia. The patient has a history of severe blood loss during surgery and a family history of hypoparathyroidism, which could indicate that the parathyroid gland was damaged during surgery. Multiple blood transfusions can exacerbate hypocalcemia by chelating calcium ions. Therefore, A, multiple blood transfusions, is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms."

Hypoparathyroidism would be a consideration if there was a family history or if the patient had prior thyroid surgery, but there is no such history given in the question.

The patient underwent a hip revision surgery which was complicated by severe blood loss, suggesting that the symptoms are due to multiple blood transfusions. The symptoms of numbness in fingertips and around the lips, adducted thumb, flexed metacarpophalangeal joints and wrists, and extended fingers suggest hypocalcemia, which is a common complication of multiple blood transfusions. The tapping test also supports this diagnosis as it elicits facial muscle contraction in hypocalcemia. Hypoparathyroidism and Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause similar symptoms but are less likely in this case. Peripheral nerve injury is also less likely given the overall clinical picture."
