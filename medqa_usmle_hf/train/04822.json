The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest delirium, which is characterized by acute onset of altered mental status and agitation, often due to an underlying medical condition or medication. Antipsychotics are commonly used to manage agitation in delirium. Repairing the fractured hip and changing medication may be appropriate at a later time but should not be the first step in managing the patient\u2019s acute symptoms. Ordering 24-hour restraints is not an appropriate option as it is considered a last resort and can actually worsen agitation and delirium."
