Methotrexate-induced lung disease can cause diffuse bilateral reticular markings with multiple pulmonary nodules. The patient also has shortness of breath aggravated by physical activity, and fine end-inspiratory rales indicate pulmonary involvement. The normal echocardiogram rules out cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and there is no history of radiation exposure to suggest radiation-induced pulmonary disease. Granulomatous lung disease may also cause pulmonary nodules, but it is less likely given the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and methotrexate use."

The presentation of shortness of breath and joint pain in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis who was started on methotrexate suggests drug-induced pulmonary disease as the most likely cause.
