The worry about a burglar breaking into her house and the fact that she drinks wine to calm her nerves also support this diagnosis."

Panic disorder would have additional symptoms such as palpitations and sweating. Adjustment disorder and atypical depression are less likely given the patient's symptoms."

The patient's symptoms suggest generalized anxiety disorder, including the tremors, restlessness, and difficulty falling asleep due to worry. Adjustment disorder is typically a response to a stressful life event, while panic disorder is characterized by sudden and intense panic attacks, and atypical depressive disorder typically involves symptoms such as weight gain and increased sleep. The patient's symptoms do not match any of these other diagnoses as closely as they match generalized anxiety disorder."

The patient\u2019s worry about a burglar breaking into her house and her restlessness and nausea before performances are indicative of anxiety.

Atypical depressive disorder typically presents with episodes of mood reactivity, severe fatigue or weakness, and hypersomnia."

The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest Generalized anxiety disorder, characterized by excessive anxiety and worry that are difficult to control and interfere with daily activities. The tremor, restlessness, and muscle tension are physical symptoms often seen in people with anxiety disorders. The fact that the symptoms worsen before concerts but also appear in other situations suggests that the anxiety is not specific to a certain situation or trigger, which favors Generalized anxiety disorder over Panic disorder. Atypical depressive disorder can also cause anxiety and physical symptoms, but there are no other significant signs of depression in this patient."
