The combination of a growing lump, presence of small nodules, and fine needle aspiration cytology revealing malignant cells arranged in a row of cells are suggestive of invasive lobular carcinoma. Inflammatory carcinoma presents with erythema and warmth of the breast, while fibroadenoma presents as a well-circumscribed mobile mass. Invasive ductal carcinoma may also present similarly, but the fine needle aspiration cytology finding of malignant cells arranged in a row of cells is more typical for invasive lobular carcinoma."
