Nitric oxide activates guanylyl cyclase, leading to increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) which relaxes smooth muscle, including the coronary vessels. This can increase blood flow to the heart and relieve chest pain. Option B, cAMP production, is more commonly associated with medications used in the treatment of heart failure. Option C, \u00df1-adrenergic antagonism, is associated with medications such as beta blockers used in the management of hypertension and angina. Option D, L-type calcium channel inhibition, is associated with calcium channel blockers also used in the management of hypertension and angina."
