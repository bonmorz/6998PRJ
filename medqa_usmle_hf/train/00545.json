The intermittent facial flushing, pruritus after showering, and new onset headaches along with an abnormal abdominal mass point to a possible diagnosis of carcinoid tumor. The elevated Hgb levels suggest an erythrocytosis, which can also be a result of a carcinoid tumor. Carcinoid tumors often have a tyrosine kinase mutation, which is the most likely cause of the patient's presentation. Fibrosis of bone marrow can cause a myeloproliferative disorder, but the presentation is not consistent with this diagnosis. BCR-ABL fusion is indicative of chronic myeloid leukemia, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Chronic hypoxemia is not a likely cause of the patient's presentation."

The presence of an abnormal abdominal mass in the left upper quadrant and the laboratory results suggest the possibility of a myeloproliferative disorder, specifically polycythemia vera. Polycythemia vera is caused by a tyrosine kinase mutation (option B) leading to overproduction of red blood cells. The intermittent facial flushing and new onset headaches can also be symptoms of polycythemia vera. Fibrosis of bone marrow (option A) can lead to myelofibrosis, but this does not explain the patient's symptoms. BCR-ABL fusion (option C) is seen in chronic myeloid leukemia, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation. Chronic hypoxemia (option D) may result in erythrocytosis, but the laboratory results and other symptoms do not support this diagnosis."

The symptoms of facial flushing and itching after showering, along with the presence of an abdominal mass, suggest a neuroendocrine tumor like carcinoid syndrome. The elevated hemoglobin level is also suggestive of this diagnosis.

Fibrosis of bone marrow and BCR-ABL fusion are associated with chronic myeloid leukemia, which is less likely to present with these symptoms.
