The lack of intraperitoneal fluid collections on FAST suggests that the injury is not to the liver or spleen, which would likely cause hemoperitoneum. The presence of right-sided flank pain suggests a kidney injury, which is supported by the low hemoglobin concentration. The stomach is an unlikely site of injury in this scenario. Therefore, the most likely cause of his presentation is injury to the kidney."

The patient's symptoms include abdominal and right-sided flank pain, numerous ecchymoses over the trunk and flanks, and a low hemoglobin concentration which are suggestive of kidney injury. The absence of intraperitoneal fluid collections on FAST also supports this conclusion. Injury to the liver or spleen would likely result in intraperitoneal bleeding and fluid collections on FAST, while injury to the stomach may not cause as much pain and tenderness."
