This mechanism of Down syndrome inheritance is called Robertsonian translocation, where a third copy of chromosome 21 is attached to another chromosome. Nondisjunction and mosaicism are other mechanisms of Down syndrome inheritance, but they do not involve attachment of chromosome 21 to another chromosome. Anticipation refers to the phenomenon where a genetic disorder becomes more severe or manifests at an earlier age in successive generations."

However, in some cases, there can be a Robertsonian translocation where part of chromosome 21 attaches to another chromosome, resulting in an extra copy. This is the mechanism of inheritance in this scenario."

The presentation strongly suggests Down syndrome, but the karyotype shows a normal number of chromosomes with a third copy of chromosome 21 genetic material having been translocated to another chromosome. This is known as Robertsonian translocation. Nondisjunction occurs when there is a failure of chromosomes to separate during meiosis, leading to an extra copy of a chromosome in one of the gametes. Mosaicism occurs when there is a mixture of two or more different types of cells, such as those with a normal chromosome number and those with an abnormal number. Anticipation refers to the tendency for certain genetic disorders to become more severe or appear at an earlier age in successive generations."

In this case, the karyotype shows two normal alleles of chromosome 21, which rules out nondisjunction (extra chromosome 21). Mosaicism refers to the presence of different chromosomal populations within an individual. Anticipation refers to the phenomenon where a genetic disorder becomes more severe or manifests at an earlier age in successive generations. The answer is therefore Robertsonian translocation, where the long arm of chromosome 21 is translocated onto another chromosome, resulting in 46 chromosomes but with extra genetic material from chromosome 21."
