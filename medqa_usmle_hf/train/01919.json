The patient\u2019s past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension and angina can also contribute to the risk of embolus formation. Generalized pallor and slight disc edema on fundus examination support this diagnosis. Detachment of the retina would present with flashes or floaters, and inflammation of the temporal artery would present with headache and scalp tenderness. Optic neuritis may also present with vision loss but is associated with pain on eye movement."
