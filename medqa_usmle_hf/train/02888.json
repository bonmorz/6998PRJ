The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with nephrotic syndrome caused by membranous glomerulonephritis, resulting in thrombosis of the renal vein. The most likely mechanism for the thrombosis is urinary loss of antithrombin III, which is a natural anticoagulant that inhibits thrombin and prevents clot formation. Hepatic synthetic failure is not a likely cause. Oral contraceptive pills increase the risk of thrombosis in the legs but not in the renal vein. Hereditary factor VIII deficiency is a cause of hemophilia A and prolonged bleeding, but not thrombosis."
