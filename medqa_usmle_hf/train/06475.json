Acute chest pain and difficulty breathing suggest pulmonary embolism, but the X-ray findings are more consistent with atelectasis.

The patient presents with chest pain and difficulty breathing, along with a recently undergone cesarean section under general anesthesia.

This is supported by the findings on the chest x-ray, which show displacement of fissures and homogeneous opacification of the lower lobe of the left lung. Bacterial blood infection or infection of the alveolar space would present with different symptoms and signs. Chronic inflammation of the respiratory system is not associated with acute chest pain and difficulty breathing."
