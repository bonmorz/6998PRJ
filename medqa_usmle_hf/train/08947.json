The most likely diagnosis based on the symptoms and laboratory findings is ulcerative colitis, which is a form of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by continuous ulcerated lesions involving the mucosa and submucosa, granular mucosa, crypt abscesses, and pseudopolyps. The lead pipe colon appearance on barium study is also consistent with this diagnosis. Option A is the best match for these findings. Option B is incorrect as it describes findings more consistent with Clostridium difficile colitis. Option C is more consistent with Crohn\u2019s disease. Option D has some similarities to ulcerative colitis but the combination of pseudomembrane formation and cobblestone appearance is more consistent with Clostridium difficile colitis."

The symptoms and laboratory findings are indicative of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with the most likely diagnosis being ulcerative colitis. The continuous ulcerated lesions and granular mucosa, along with the lead pipe appearance, suggest ulcerative colitis, which is most likely to affect the colon and limited to the mucosa and submucosa. Crohn\u2019s disease, on the other hand, affects the entire bowel wall and has a cobblestone and skip lesion appearance. Hence, option (A) is the correct choice."
