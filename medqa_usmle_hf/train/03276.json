The presence of multiple red spots suggests cherry angioma, which is a benign vascular lesion commonly found on the trunk. The bleeding after scratching also supports this diagnosis, as cherry angiomas are prone to bleeding with trauma. Amelanotic melanoma usually presents as a pink or flesh-colored nodule, but the photograph shows a flat, round lesion. Spider angiomas typically have a central arteriole with radiating capillaries, which is not present in the photograph.
