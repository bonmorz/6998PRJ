Isosorbide dinitrate is a medication that dilates blood vessels and reduces the workload of the heart, but taking it at night can cause tolerance and reduce its effectiveness during the day. Discontinuing atorvastatin therapy will increase the patient\u2019s risk of coronary events. Tadalafil can also dilate blood vessels, but should not be taken with nitrate medications like isosorbide dinitrate. Decreasing aerobic exercise will not improve the patient\u2019s symptoms. Therefore, the best option is to avoid isosorbide dinitrate at night to improve its effectiveness during the day."
