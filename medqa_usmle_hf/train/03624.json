The patient\u2019s symptoms and the mass palpated suggest intussusception, a condition where a part of the intestine slides into an adjacent part of the intestine. Technetium-99m scan is the most sensitive diagnostic test for intussusception. Henoch-Schonlein purpura can present with abdominal pain, but it is usually accompanied by a rash. Positive stool culture would suggest an infection, but the presence of a mass makes intussusception more likely. Resolution with dietary modification is not a common treatment for intussusception."
