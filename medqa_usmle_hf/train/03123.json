The description of poorly cohesive cells growing in sheets with invasion into surrounding tissues suggests a high-grade lesion. The absence of lymph node adenopathy or distant metastases indicates a low stage, therefore the correct answer is high grade and low stage (C). High grade and high stage (A) would indicate advanced disease with lymph node involvement and/or distant metastases. High grade and no stage (B) is not a possible answer as staging is necessary for proper management. Low grade and high stage (D) would indicate a less aggressive tumor with advanced spread."
