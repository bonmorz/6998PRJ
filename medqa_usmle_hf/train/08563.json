The kidney involvement, chest x-ray findings, and acanthocytes in the urinalysis suggest glomerulonephritis, which is also commonly seen in GPA. Elevated c-ANCA (proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) titers are often found in GPA, making this the most likely answer choice. None of the other options are associated with GPA."
