Among the options, only inhibition of hepatic VLDL synthesis, which is the mechanism of action of fibrates, can cause an increase in uric acid levels, leading to gout. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, bile acid absorption, and intestinal cholesterol absorption are the mechanisms of statins, bile acid sequestrants, and ezetimibe, respectively, which do not increase uric acid levels."
