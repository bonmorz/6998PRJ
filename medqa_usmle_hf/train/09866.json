The patient had been on immunosuppressive treatment and had stopped taking prophylactic antifungal medication, making him susceptible to a fungal infection. The accompanying picture shows a fuzzy mold which is characteristic of Coccidioides species, a fungus found in the soil of warm, arid regions of the southwestern United States. This organism causes coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley fever, which can present as flu-like symptoms and can also involve the lungs. Blastomyces dermatitidis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum are other fungal pathogens that can cause lung infections, but their morphology on culture and staining would differ from that of Coccidioides species."

Among the options, only Coccidioides species fit this description. The lactophenol cotton blue preparation also shows the characteristic spherules produced by Coccidioides species. Blastomyces dermatitidis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum are also dimorphic fungi, but they have different growth requirements and morphologic features."
