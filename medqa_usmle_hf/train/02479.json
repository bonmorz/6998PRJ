The fact that both pupils partially constrict when the light is shined in the right eye suggests a lesion in the right optic nerve, which is responsible for carrying visual information from the right eye to the brain. Lesions in the other options (ciliary ganglion, lateral geniculate nucleus, oculomotor nerve) would have different effects on pupillary response."

The pupillary response supports this, as the dilation and partial constriction seen indicate a problem with the afferent limb of the pupillary reflex arc, which is controlled by the optic nerve. The other options are not likely given the presentation and exam findings. The ciliary ganglion controls accommodation and parsympathetic pupillary constriction, while the lateral geniculate nucleus is involved in vision processing and the oculomotor nerve controls most of the eye muscles but not pupillary constriction."

The pupillary response test reveals a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), which indicates that the optic nerve on the right side is not functioning properly. The other options involve different parts of the visual pathway, but the RAPD suggests that the problem is at the level of the optic nerve itself."

Answers A and C are incorrect because they involve the efferent limb of the pupillary response, while answer B involves the visual pathways after the optic nerve."
