Given that the patient developed a fever and chills after receiving a transfusion, it is likely that she experienced a transfusion reaction. Leukocyte reduction of blood products can prevent transfusion reactions by removing white blood cells, which can trigger immune reactions in the recipient. Coombs test and ABO grouping and Rh typing are important measures to ensure compatibility between donor and recipient, but they do not prevent transfusion reactions. Prophylactic immunoglobulins are not indicated in this context."
