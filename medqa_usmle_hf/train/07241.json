The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest acute torticollis or wry neck, which can be caused by a variety of factors such as muscle spasm or cervical disc herniation. However, given the patient\u2019s recent diagnosis of schizophrenia, it is important to consider potential adverse effects of antipsychotic medications, such as acute dystonia. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that can be used to treat acute dystonia. Therefore, the best initial step in management would be to administer diphenhydramine. Option A is incorrect as changing medication is not an immediate solution to the patient's current symptom. Option B is incorrect as dantrolene is used to treat malignant hyperthermia, which is not indicated in this patient's current symptoms. Option D is incorrect as propranolol is a beta-blocker used to treat hypertension and is not indicated in this patient's current symptoms."

Diphenhydramine can be used for symptomatic relief of allergic reaction symptoms and can be given as the initial step in management. Changing medication to clozapine or using dantrolene or propranolol are not appropriate initial steps in management."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, including neck stiffness and impaired range of motion, suggest a possible case of acute torticollis. Diphenhydramine can help with muscle spasms and relieve some of the symptoms. None of the other options are appropriate for this condition. Changing the patient's medication to clozapine is not indicated until a complete evaluation is performed. Dantrolene is used to manage spasticity and muscle rigidity, but it is not the first-line treatment for torticollis.
