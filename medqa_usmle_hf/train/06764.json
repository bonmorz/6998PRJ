The spinal cord lesion is on the left side, and pain sensation is transmitted contralaterally, meaning that it would be impaired on the right side of the body. Proprioceptive sensation is transmitted ipsilaterally, so it would be impaired on the left side of the body. Temperature sensation is transmitted contralaterally, but this lesion would only affect the lower thoracic region, so it is unlikely to affect temperature sensation from the left side of the body. Vibratory sensation is also transmitted ipsilaterally, so it would be impaired on the left side of the body. Therefore, the correct answer is (A), pain sensation from the right side of the body."
