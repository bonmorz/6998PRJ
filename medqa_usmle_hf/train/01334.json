The fact that the boy is currently taking antibiotics, and the appearance of the rash and joint pain after starting the medication, supports this possibility. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to discontinue the antibiotic. Switching to doxycycline is not appropriate as it is also an antibiotic and may have similar effects. Prednisone may help with symptoms but the first step is to discontinue the causative agent. Allergy testing is not indicated in this case as the reaction is likely due to a drug and not an allergy."

Discontinuing the antibiotic is the most appropriate next step in management. Switching to an alternative antibiotic, such as doxycycline, is not necessary since the pharyngitis has already been treated. Prednisone may be used if there is severe joint pain or renal impairment, but it is not an appropriate first-line treatment. Allergy testing is not indicated in this case."

Allergy testing and switching to doxycycline are not necessary. Prednisone should not be used for treatment of APSGN.
