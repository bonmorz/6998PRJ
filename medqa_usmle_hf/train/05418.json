The patient is exhibiting signs of respiratory distress and paradoxical inward movement of the abdomen during inspiration, indicating that the accessory muscles of respiration are being used. Sternocleidomastoid muscles are one of the accessory muscles of respiration and play an important role in inspiration.

In patients with neuromuscular diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, respiratory muscles become weak, and sternocleidomastoid muscles become the most important for inspiration. This is because these muscles help raise the rib cage, allowing for air to be drawn into the lungs."

Among the options, only the sternocleidomastoid muscles are important inspiratory muscles. The inward movement of the abdomen during inspiration indicates that the abdominal muscles are not being used for inspiration. The lack of breath sounds in the lower lungs bilaterally suggest that the diaphragm is not being used for inspiration, eliminating the option of muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. The trapezium muscle is involved in the movement of the shoulder blade and upper back and is not involved in breathing. The internal intercostal muscles are involved in expiration, not inspiration."
