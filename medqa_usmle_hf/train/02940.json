The patient\u2019s symptoms and physical examination suggest cholesteatoma, which is a growth of skin cells in the middle ear that can cause hearing loss, dizziness, and ear discharge. The most appropriate therapy is surgical excision to prevent the growth from damaging surrounding structures. Topical ciprofloxacin can be used to treat ear infections, but it will not address the underlying cholesteatoma. Systemic corticosteroids may provide some relief for hearing loss and ringing but will not treat the cholesteatoma itself. Fitting for hearing aids may help with hearing loss, but it will not address the underlying condition."
