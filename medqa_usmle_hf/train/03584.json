Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that can be used to control the symptoms of PNETs. 5-fluorouracil is a chemotherapy drug that can be used to slow the growth of PNETs. Streptozotocin is another chemotherapy drug that can specifically target PNETs, making it the best choice among the options given. Paclitaxel and Methotrexate are not commonly used to treat PNETs.
