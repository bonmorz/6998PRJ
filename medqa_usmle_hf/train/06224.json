The patient presents with symptoms of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and alcohol consumption. The yellow plaques below the lower eyelids bilaterally suggest xanthelasma, which is associated with hyperlipidemia. The absence of right popliteal and pedal pulses and loss of hair and brittle toenails on the right foot suggest ischemia. The most appropriate management to prevent future morbidity and mortality of this patient's condition is Clopidogrel therapy, as it inhibits platelet aggregation and reduces the risk of cardiovascular events. Pentoxifylline therapy is used for intermittent claudication, but may not be as effective as antiplatelet therapy for preventing cardiovascular events. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and graded exercise therapy may be considered for symptomatic relief and improvement of walking distance, but are not the initial management for prevention of future morbidity and mortality."

The patient\u2019s symptoms, especially the absence of the right popliteal and pedal pulses suggests peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Yellow plaques below the lower eyelids and loss of hair on the distal third of the right leg are diagnostic of atherosclerosis in the lower extremities, and PAD is a systemic disease that affects other areas including the coronary and cerebral vessels, increasing the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Clopidogrel therapy is indicated for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with PAD. Pentoxifylline therapy is an option for improving walking distance in patients with PAD, but does not reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is beneficial in patients with severe, symptomatic PAD or in whom lifestyle changes and medical management have failed. Graded exercise therapy is a part of the conservative management of PAD, but is not recommended as the initial management strategy in this patient with severe PAD."
