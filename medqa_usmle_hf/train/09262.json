The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest social anxiety disorder, performance only, which is a specific type of social anxiety disorder that only happens in specific situations such as public speaking. Panic disorder is characterized by recurring panic attacks, which do not fit the patient\u2019s symptoms. The patient\u2019s social life and enjoyment of classes and work also suggest that this is not a generalized social anxiety disorder. Normal human behavior would not cause such severe symptoms."

The fact that it only happens in front of large groups and that he has a normal social life points towards the diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, performance only, rather than social anxiety disorder, generalized. Panic disorder is less likely since the patient's symptoms are specific to public speaking and are not generalized to other situations. The option of normal human behavior can be ruled out since the patient's symptoms are causing significant distress and impairment in his ability to perform tasks."
