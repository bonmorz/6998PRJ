The location of the lesion in the right medial temporal lobe with medial displacement of the uncus and parahippocampal gyrus of the temporal lobe is consistent with a subdural hematoma. The oculomotor nerve arises from the midbrain and runs through the cavernous sinus, which is close to the temporal lobe. Compression of the oculomotor nerve can cause a blown pupil and ocular muscle paralysis, making oculomotor nerve the most likely cranial nerve to be injured in this case."

The hyperdense fluid collection in the right medial temporal lobe causing displacement of the uncus and parahippocampal gyrus suggests that the patient has a subdural hematoma. The oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) controls eye movement and pupillary size, and its compression is a common complication of temporal lobe herniation. Thus, the most likely cranial nerve to be injured in this patient is the oculomotor nerve."

The CT scan showing a hyperdense fluid collection in the right medial temporal lobe with medial displacement of the uncus and parahippocampal gyrus of the temporal lobe is suggestive of a subdural hematoma. The most likely cranial nerve to be affected by this lesion is the oculomotor nerve, which innervates the eye muscles responsible for eye movement and constriction of the pupil. The injury can cause a dilated pupil (due to unopposed action of the sympathetic nerves) and eye movement abnormalities."
