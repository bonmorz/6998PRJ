The elevated human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations and decreased maternal serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein A suggest a high risk for chromosomal abnormalities, specifically Down syndrome. Chorionic villus sampling, which involves sampling the placental tissue, can confirm the diagnosis with more than 99% accuracy. Quadruple marker test and cell-free DNA testing are less invasive but less accurate in diagnosing chromosomal abnormalities. Amniocentesis is typically performed later in pregnancy and may not necessarily confirm the diagnosis of Down syndrome."

The combination of a thick nuchal translucency, decreased maternal serum PAPP-A, and elevated hCG levels indicate an increased risk for chromosomal abnormalities such as Down Syndrome. The best diagnostic option is chorionic villus sampling, which obtains a small sample of the placenta to analyze the fetal chromosomes. The other options are screening tests and may not provide a definitive diagnosis."
