The absence of adnexal masses suggests normal ovaries, and the normal-sized uterus suggests normal endometrial lining. Hysterosalpingogram is the most appropriate next step to assess the patency of the fallopian tubes and any uterine abnormalities. Postcoital testing will only show if sperm can survive in the cervical mucus, and hysteroscopy is invasive and not necessary at this stage. Chromosomal karyotyping is not indicated for this patient as there is no previous history of genetic disease or abnormal physical features."

The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is a hysterosalpingogram, which is a radiologic test that determines whether the fallopian tubes are open or blocked, and can detect abnormalities within the uterus. This can help identify any structural abnormalities that may be preventing pregnancy. Postcoital testing checks the interaction between cervical mucus and sperm, hysteroscopy is an invasive procedure that visualizes the inside of the uterus, and chromosomal karyotyping is not indicated unless there is a specific concern for a genetic defect."

The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is hysterosalpingogram, as it can detect tubal occlusion or abnormalities in the uterus that may be preventing conception. Postcoital testing can also be done, but it has lower sensitivity and specificity compared to hysterosalpingogram. Hysteroscopy is usually done after hysterosalpingogram if there are any abnormalities found. Chromosomal karyotyping may be necessary if there is suspicion of a genetic abnormality, but it is unlikely to be the first-line diagnostic test in this case."
