This infection can cause decreased production of RBCs and is known to cause an aplastic crisis in patients with sickle cell disease. The laboratory findings also show a decrease in RBCs with a low reticulocyte count, which is consistent with an aplastic crisis. IgG-mediated hemolytic anemia would have a positive Coombs test and myelofibrosis would not present with sickle cells on the peripheral blood smear."
