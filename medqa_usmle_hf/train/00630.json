As the patient is relatively tall and thin, BMI is low, and there is no history of kidney disease, option A can be excluded.

Therefore, the most likely cause is a decrease in arterial compliance, which occurs with age and can contribute to elevated blood pressure."

The absence of palpable renal masses and normal laboratory values for aldosterone production suggests that there is no increase in kidney size or aldosterone production. Decrease in baroreceptor sensitivity is possible, but decrease in arterial compliance is the most likely underlying cause. This is because arterial stiffness increases with age, and the patient is 68 years old."

The patient has consistently elevated blood pressure readings, and among the options, a decrease in arterial compliance is the most likely underlying cause. This is common in aging and can be exacerbated by other conditions such as primary hypothyroidism. An increase in kidney size would not necessarily cause elevated blood pressure, and the patient's renal cyst has been stable for 20 years. A decrease in baroreceptor sensitivity would affect blood pressure regulation, but it is less likely to be the sole cause of consistent elevated readings. An increase in aldosterone production could contribute to hypertension, but it would not explain the consistently elevated readings over multiple times."
