The patient\u2019s history and physical examination suggest cystic fibrosis, which affects the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. The most reliable test for diagnosis is measuring sweat chloride levels, which is elevated in patients with cystic fibrosis. Sputum culture for acid-fast bacilli is more likely to be ordered for patients with suspected tuberculosis. Serum quantitative immunoglobulin levels and skin testing for Aspergillus reactivity may help in diagnosing other respiratory disorders but are not specific for cystic fibrosis."
