Serology and PCR only help identify the presence of infectious agents; esophagogastroduodenoscopy can visualize the esophagus and stomach but may not necessarily confirm the diagnosis. Esophageal pH monitoring detects the presence of gastroesophageal reflux, which may be a contributing factor, but does not confirm the diagnosis."

Serology and PCR, Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and Esophageal pH monitoring can also help diagnose dysphagia, but are less likely to identify megas, which is a distinct possibility in this case."
