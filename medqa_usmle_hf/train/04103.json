The presentation of fever, multiple skin lesions, nausea, and abdominal pain in an HIV-positive patient with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count less than 200/mm3 suggests possible disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection. The biopsy showing small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain supports this diagnosis. Among the options, erythromycin is the drug of choice for treating MAC infection. Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are used to treat toxoplasmosis, which is unlikely in this case. Azithromycin and ethambutol are used to treat Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is less likely due to the presentation of the skin lesions. Nitazoxanide is used to treat parasitic infections and is not appropriate for this patient's presentation."
