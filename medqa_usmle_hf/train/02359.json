An MRI is the most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate for a meniscal tear, and a hyperintense line in the meniscus is a common finding in such cases. Option B is unlikely as that would suggest osteoporosis, not a meniscal tear. Option C refers to findings in rheumatoid arthritis, which may be present in the patient's family history but are not consistent with her current symptoms. Option D refers to examination findings in cases of posterior cruciate ligament injury, which is not indicated by the patient's symptoms."
