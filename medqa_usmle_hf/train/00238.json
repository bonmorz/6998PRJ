The patient has a history of anxiety and is experiencing acute symptoms, along with confusion, which suggests benzodiazepine withdrawal. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be given to alleviate anxiety symptoms and prevent further withdrawal. Midazolam is another benzodiazepine but it has a short half-life and is better suited for acute anxiety in a hospital setting. Sodium bicarbonate is not indicated for this patient's presentation. Supportive therapy and monitoring alone may not alleviate his symptoms and prevent further withdrawal."

The patient is experiencing anxiety and confusion and has a history of anxiety and depression, and is currently on medications for anxiety.

Midazolam is also a benzodiazepine but is more commonly used for sedation or anesthesia. Sodium bicarbonate is used to treat certain acid-base imbalances and is not indicated for this patient's symptoms. Supportive therapy and monitoring may also be appropriate but is not sufficient treatment for the patient's acute symptoms.
