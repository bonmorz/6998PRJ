Cell-free fetal DNA testing is a non-invasive method of screening for Down syndrome with a high degree of accuracy and a low risk to the fetus. It involves analyzing cell-free fetal DNA in the mother's blood. Maternal serum screening is an option but has a higher false positive rate, while amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are invasive and carry a small risk of miscarriage. Given the patient's preference for immediate and secure screening, cell-free fetal DNA testing is the most appropriate next step."

Cell-free fetal DNA testing is a noninvasive prenatal screening test that involves taking a sample of the mother\u2019s blood to analyze fetal DNA. It is a relatively safe and reliable option for Down syndrome screening and is preferred by many patients due to its low risk and immediate results. Maternal serum testing is also a screening option, but it has higher false positive rates and may require follow-up diagnostic testing. Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are diagnostic tests that carry a small risk of miscarriage and are generally reserved for patients with higher-risk pregnancies or abnormal screening results."
