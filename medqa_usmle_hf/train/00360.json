The symptoms and chest radiograph suggest respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which is common in premature infants due to insufficient surfactant. Pneumothorax occurs when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall, and there is no mention of trauma or mechanical ventilation in the scenario. Transient tachypnea of the newborn is a mild respiratory problem that can occur after birth due to delayed reabsorption of fetal lung fluid, but it typically resolves within several hours to days without treatment. Cyanotic congenital heart disease would typically present with other symptoms beyond respiratory distress, such as a heart murmur or cyanosis that doesn't improve with oxygen administration."
