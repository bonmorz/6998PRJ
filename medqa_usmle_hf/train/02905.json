The symptoms, history of travel to Tanzania, and photograph of the tongue suggest that the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is multiple myeloma. Pitting edema, jugular venous distention, and crackles suggest fluid overload due to the paraproteinemia in multiple myeloma. Other options such as endocardial fibroelastosis, systemic sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis do not present with these specific symptoms. The low hemoglobin concentration and reduced diastolic filling on echocardiography can also be attributed to multiple myeloma."
