The presence of joint involvement and proteinuria suggests serum sickness. Decreased serum complement concentration may be seen in serum sickness. A positive ELISA for anti-hemidesmosome antibodies may indicate pemphigus vulgaris, while increased antistreptolysin O titers may suggest streptococcal infection. Keratinocyte necrosis on skin biopsy may suggest bullous pemphigoid or pemphigus vulgaris, but is not specific to serum sickness."
