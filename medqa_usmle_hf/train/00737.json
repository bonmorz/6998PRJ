The blind pouch vagina and Tanner IV breasts support this diagnosis. The best next step in management is gonadectomy, which is done to prevent the development of testicular cancer. Estrogen replacement therapy would not be effective and vaginoplasty is not recommended until counseling about gender identity is completed. ACTH stimulation test is not indicated for this patient."
