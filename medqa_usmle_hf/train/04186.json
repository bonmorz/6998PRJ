Fat necrosis occurs when lipases, enzymes that break down lipids, are released from injured adipose tissue and break down triglycerides into free fatty acids. These free fatty acids then react with calcium to form calcium soaps, which are the white deposits observed. Therefore, abnormal activity of lipases is most likely responsible for the calcium deposits observed."

The question describes the presence of white deposits containing calcium in the abdominal tissues, which is most likely indicative of acute pancreatitis. In acute pancreatitis, lipase enzymes are activated within the pancreas and cause autodigestion of the pancreatic tissue, leading to the release of calcium deposits. Lipases are enzymes that break down fat molecules and are responsible for the digestion of dietary fats. Therefore, abnormal activity of lipases is most likely responsible for the calcium deposits in the abdominal tissues. The other options (Immunoglobulin, Plasmin, and Proteases) are not directly related to lipid digestion or the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis."
