The sudden onset of pain and swelling in the leg, history of trauma, and presence of erythema and pitting edema suggest deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The absence of increased resistance or pain in the right calf in response to forced dorsiflexion of the right foot makes a DVT less likely. However, an ultrasound of the right leg is the best next step to confirm or exclude DVT. Reassurance and supportive treatment is not appropriate without further evaluation. D-dimer levels may be elevated in many conditions other than DVT and are not specific for DVT.
