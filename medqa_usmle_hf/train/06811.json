Among the options, pindolol is a non-selective beta-blocker and is most likely to produce a similar response as drug B. Albuterol is a beta-2 agonist and would not decrease contractility. Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker but has a more potent negative inotropic effect than pindolol. Phenoxybenzamine is not a beta-blocker, but an alpha-blocker used for hypertension caused by pheochromocytoma."
