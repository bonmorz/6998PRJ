Low blood pressure is also a common finding in early pregnancy due to the decreased vascular resistance, so option D is also normal. However, the presence of a diastolic murmur is considered abnormal and warrants further investigation. It may indicate a problem with the heart valves, which could be exacerbated by pregnancy."
