Exercise therapy is the best initial treatment option as it can help to increase blood flow and improve symptoms. This should be done under supervision to ensure safety. Mediterranean diet and the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel can be used in addition to exercise therapy, but they are not the best initial treatment.
