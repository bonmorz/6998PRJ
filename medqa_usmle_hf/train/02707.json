Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is often treated with monoclonal antibodies against CD20+ such as rituximab, which can lower the body's immune system and increase susceptibility to infections. The symptoms suggest a viral infection, and the MRI and CSF assay support this. The virus has double-stranded, circular DNA, which is characteristic of certain viruses such as polyomaviruses, which can cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's current condition is the monoclonal antibody against CD20+."
