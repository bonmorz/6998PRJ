The patient has multiple risk factors for methotrexate-induced cytopenias, including his age, previous use of immunosuppressive agents, and recent initiation of methotrexate. Leucovorin is a folinic acid that is used as an antidote for methotrexate toxicity, which may prevent the patient's laboratory abnormalities. Amifostine is used to prevent radiation-induced toxicity, pyridoxine is used to supplement various deficiencies, and mesna is used as a prophylaxis for chemotherapy-induced hemorrhagic cystitis, none of which are relevant to this patient's case."
