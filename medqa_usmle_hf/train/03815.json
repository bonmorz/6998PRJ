The patient\u2019s symptoms and history of excessive alcohol use and smoking, as well as the possibility of gallstones, suggest the need for a CT scan of the abdomen to evaluate for possible underlying malignancy or other pathology. CT scan of the liver (option B) would be included in an abdominal CT, and a HIDA scan (option C) would not be indicated in this scenario. However, smoking cessation advice and primary care follow up (option D) should also be provided as a part of overall management."
