CD18 is a component of leukocyte cell adhesion molecules that are necessary for cell-cell interactions between white blood cells and endothelial cells. In the absence of CD18, leukocytes fail to adhere to the endothelium during their migration to the site of infection. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. Option (A) is incorrect because selectins are expressed on the surface of endothelial cells, not leukocytes. Option (C) is incorrect because CD18-deficiency is not associated with excessive secretion of IL-2. Option (D) is incorrect because impaired formation of the membrane attack complex is associated with deficiencies of the complement system, not leukocyte adhesion molecules."
