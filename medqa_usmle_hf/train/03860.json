However, the absence of bowel gas on the abdominal x-ray suggests that the most likely diagnosis is congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which is caused by a defect in mesodermal differentiation. The other options such as defect in the pleuroperitoneal membrane or absence of dynein are not associated with this condition. Deletion in the long arm of chromosome 22 is associated with DiGeorge syndrome, which is not the most likely diagnosis in this scenario."

The symptoms suggest the newborn has neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, which is commonly caused by a deficiency of surfactant. Surfactant is a phospholipid secreted by type II alveolar cells, which helps to reduce surface tension in the lungs and prevents alveolar collapse at the end of expiration. The deficiency of surfactant production can be caused by a defect in mesodermal differentiation. The other options are not associated with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome."

The clinical presentation suggests meconium aspiration syndrome, which occurs when a newborn inhales meconium-stained amniotic fluid into the lungs. This results in obstructive airway disease and pulmonary hypertension, which can explain the tachypnea and bluish discoloration of the extremities. The holosystolic murmur suggests a ventricular septal defect, which can be caused by mesodermal differentiation defects. Defect in the pleuroperitoneal membrane is associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, while absence of dynein is associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia. Deletion in the long arm of chromosome 22 is associated with DiGeorge syndrome."
