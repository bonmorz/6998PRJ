The symptoms are consistent with Myasthenia Gravis, which is caused by decreased generation of end plate potential at the neuromuscular junction. Option A is incorrect because inhibition of calcium release causes hyperexcitability, not weakness. Option B is incorrect because sustained blockade would cause permanent weakness, not fluctuating symptoms. Option D is incorrect because impaired flow of calcium ions between gap junctions is not a known cause of weakness in Myasthenia Gravis."
