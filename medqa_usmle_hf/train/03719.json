The CT angiogram shows a renal artery thrombus, which can lead to kidney infarction and potentially serious complications. Administering anticoagulation with heparin is the appropriate initial treatment to prevent further thrombus formation and allow for eventual resolution. Surgery or thrombectomy may be considered in certain cases, but anticoagulation is the first-line therapy. Warfarin would not be appropriate as initial therapy, as it takes longer to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation than heparin. The results of the laboratory studies may help determine the underlying cause of the thrombus, such as a hypercoagulable state, and guide further management."
