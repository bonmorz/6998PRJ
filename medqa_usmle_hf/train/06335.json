Based on the poor weight gain and feeding difficulties, the presence of a holosystolic murmur and a mid-diastolic low-pitched rumble at the apex, and the echocardiogram results, the patient has a large VSD that requires surgical closure to prevent further complications. Options A and B are not appropriate as the Qp:Qs ratio is greater than two, indicating a significant shunt that requires treatment. Option D may be considered in certain cases, but surgical closure is the preferred option for large VSDs."

The child has poor weight gain, feeding difficulties, dyspnea, and hepatomegaly, which indicates that the VSD is causing significant left-to-right shunt and pulmonary hypertension. The Qp:Qs ratio of 2.8:1 further confirms this assessment. Therefore, the best management option is surgical closure of the defect to prevent future complications such as heart failure and pulmonary vascular disease. Continuing medical treatment or waiting for spontaneous closure is not optimal in this case. Digoxin is not indicated for VSD and transcatheter occlusion may not be feasible in a newborn with a large defect."
