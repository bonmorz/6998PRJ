The patient's symptoms suggest spinal stenosis, and leaning forward can relieve the pain by increasing the volume of the spinal canal.

Positive HLA-B27 suggests ankylosing spondylitis, which might not be related to the patient's symptoms. Decreased ankle-brachial index suggests peripheral artery disease which does not explain the patient's lower back pain and numbness."
