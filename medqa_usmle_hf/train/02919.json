The antihypertensive medication described is likely a calcium channel blocker, which works by decreasing transmembrane calcium current across vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to vasodilation and decreased blood pressure. Skeletal muscle contraction, on the other hand, occurs independently of extracellular calcium influx, so blocking this influx does not affect skeletal muscle contraction. Option B is incorrect because skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor activation does depend on membrane depolarization. Option C is incorrect because skeletal muscle primarily expresses L-type calcium channels. Option D is incorrect because calcium channel blockers do induce a conformational change in calcium channels to reduce calcium influx."
