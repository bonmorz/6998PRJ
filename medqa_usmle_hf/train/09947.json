The dislocated lens may suggest a connective tissue disorder such as Marfan syndrome. The increased concentration of a metabolic intermediate in serum and urine suggests a genetic defect in cystathionine synthase, which leads to homocystinuria. This condition is associated with connective tissue disorders and an increased risk for stroke."

The increased concentration of a metabolic intermediate in the serum and urine suggests a metabolic disorder. Among the options, only cystathionine synthase deficiency is associated with a metabolic disorder and Marfan syndrome."

The laboratory finding of an increased metabolic intermediate in the serum and urine indicates a deficiency of cystathionine synthase, which leads to homocystinuria, a potential complication of Marfan syndrome. Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency causes phenylketonuria, homogentisate oxidase deficiency causes alkaptonuria, and branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency causes maple syrup urine disease, but none of these conditions explain the patient\u2019s symptoms and signs."
