The symptoms, including weakness in the proximal muscles and normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and creatine kinase, suggest an adverse effect of medication, specifically glucocorticoids, which are commonly used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus. Autoantibodies against postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors can cause myasthenia gravis, but the symptoms do not fit a pattern of muscle weakness worsening with exercise and improving with rest. Autoantibodies against myelin can cause multiple sclerosis, but the symptoms do not fit a pattern of disseminated neurological deficits. Upper and lower motor neuron degeneration can cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but it typically presents with progressive weakness and atrophy, hyperreflexia, and fasciculations, which are not present in this case."
