Clostridium botulinum causes botulism in infants, which presents with generalized weakness and poor feeding. Staphylococcus epidermidis is a common cause of late-onset sepsis in newborns. Neisseria meningitidis causes meningitis and sepsis, but is more common in older children and adolescents."

The newborn is ill-appearing and lethargic, with a high fever and grunting on auscultation, indicating a possible infection. The leukocyte count is significantly elevated (normal range for newborns is 5,000-30,000/mm3), indicating an immune response to infection. The low platelet count and low serum glucose are also concerning. Based on the mother's history of genital vesicles and gush of blood-tinged fluid before labor, the most likely causal organism is Streptococcus agalactiae, which can be transmitted from mother to baby during childbirth and cause severe infections in newborns. Clostridium botulinum causes botulism and is not associated with fever and sepsis in newborns. Staphylococcus epidermidis is a common cause of neonatal sepsis but does not typically cause such a severe presentation. Neisseria meningitidis can cause meningitis but is not the most likely organism based on the clinical presentation and maternal history."
