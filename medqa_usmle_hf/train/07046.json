The other options may play a role in the decision-making process, but the legal obligation to report takes precedence. The physical examination did not reveal signs of abuse, but neglect can also be a form of abuse and the persistent diaper rash and dehydration suggest neglect. The daycare worker's paperwork authorizing the physician to report is not relevant, as reporting is already mandatory by law."

In many countries, physicians are legally mandated to report any suspected cases of child abuse or neglect regardless of other factors or documentation.

The presence or absence of paperwork authorizing the physician to report is irrelevant as reporting suspected child abuse is a legal obligation for physicians. Option (B) suggests physical abuse is suspected, which is not mentioned in the scenario."
