The patient has multiple risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea, which is a common cause of morning headaches and daytime fatigue. The initial step in management should be weight loss, which can help improve symptoms of sleep apnea and also address other comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may also be indicated if there is confirmed sleep apnea, but weight loss should be attempted first. Ibuprofen and follow up in 2 weeks is not a reasonable answer as it does not address the underlying cause of the headaches. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty is a surgical procedure for sleep apnea, but it is not recommended as the initial step in management and should be reserved for cases where weight loss and CPAP therapy have failed."
