The patient seems to be experiencing a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, a febrile reaction that occurs after the initiation of antibiotic treatment for certain infections, such as syphilis. The most appropriate next step in management would be to prescribe an antipyretic and an analgesic for symptom relief. Oral prednisone is not indicated in this case because it could worsen the infection. Administering intramuscular epinephrine is not indicated because there is no bronchospasm. Prescribing doxycycline for 28 days is not indicated because the patient already received benzathine penicillin, which is the preferred treatment for syphilis."
