The patient has acute otitis externa, which is an infection in the outer ear canal that can cause severe pain and tenderness. Culture results are pending, but empiric therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics is recommended. Intravenous ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic commonly used for the treatment of soft tissue infections and is effective against most of the bacteria that can cause acute otitis externa. Oral clarithromycin would not be the best choice because the patient has severe disease and is febrile, which suggests that parenteral antibiotics would be more appropriate. Topical clotrimazole is an antifungal medication and is not recommended for the treatment of bacterial infections. Intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be effective against some of the bacteria that can cause acute otitis externa, but it is not as broad-spectrum as ciprofloxacin and is not typically used as first-line therapy for this condition."

The CT scan confirms the diagnosis and shows severe thickening and enhancing of the soft tissue of the external auditory canal with patchy destruction of the mastoid process. Treatment usually involves antibiotics, and intravenous ciprofloxacin is the most appropriate option until culture results are available. Oral clarithromycin is an alternative option, but it may not be effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common causative organism in severe cases of otitis externa. Topical clotrimazole is used to treat fungal infections, not bacterial infections. Intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is not a good choice for treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections."
