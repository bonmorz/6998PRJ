The symptoms suggest carpal tunnel syndrome and tapping over the median nerve at the wrist can elicit a positive Tinel sign. EMG studies can confirm the diagnosis and will most likely show focal slowing of conduction velocity in the median nerve at the wrist. Denervation in C7 innervated paraspinal, arms, and shoulder muscles is more indicative of cervical radiculopathy. Widespread symmetrical neuropathic changes without focal abnormalities are more indicative of conditions such as peripheral neuropathy. Neuropathic changes in the palmar branch of the median nerve alone would not explain the patient's symptoms."
