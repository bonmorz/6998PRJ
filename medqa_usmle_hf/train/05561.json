The symptoms described by the patient suggest a possible neurological issue, which is supported by the frequent headaches and episodes of blurry vision or blind spots.

Psychological assessment for conversion disorder may be considered if neurological problems are ruled out. Urine dipstick and culture are not relevant in this case. CBT may be helpful in managing symptoms, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management."
