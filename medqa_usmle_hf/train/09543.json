The clinical presentation, biopsy findings, and the predominant eosinophilic infiltrate suggest bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune disease that affects the skin. Direct immunofluorescence study is the best next diagnostic step to confirm the diagnosis. It involves testing the skin biopsy for the presence of antibodies and complement proteins that indicate autoimmune activity. Indirect immunofluorescence study is useful for the detection of circulating antibodies, but is not as specific for bullous pemphigoid. Swab and culture of the blister or bacteriological examination of fluid drained from the blister is not useful in the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid."
