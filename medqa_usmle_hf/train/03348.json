The patient has symptoms of lethargy, confusion, and nausea, and laboratory studies show anemia, elevated serum calcium, and elevated serum creatinine, which are all suggestive of multiple myeloma. Option (A) is incorrect because elevated PTHrP levels are seen in hypercalcemia of malignancy that is not related to multiple myeloma. Option (B) is incorrect because 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D is not commonly associated with elevated calcium levels. Option (C) is incorrect because while parathyroid glands can cause hypercalcemia, it is rare for them to cause such severe and acute symptoms."
