The patient presents with symptoms that suggest acute cholecystitis, including abdominal pain, fever, and elevated bilirubin levels. Additional testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the best next step in management as it can identify gallstones or other obstructions that may require immediate intervention. FAST exam (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) is used to evaluate for internal bleeding in trauma patients and is not applicable in this scenario. Nasogastric tube and NPO (nothing by mouth) may be used in acute pancreatitis but are not the preferred initial management for acute cholecystitis. Supportive therapy followed by elective cholecystectomy is appropriate for uncomplicated cases of acute cholecystitis, but in this case, the patient\u2019s symptoms are severe and require immediate management."

Nasogastric tube and NPO may be useful in certain situations such as suspected gastric outlet obstruction, but they are not the best next step in this case.
