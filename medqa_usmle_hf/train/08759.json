The patient's symptoms, specifically yellowish discoloration of the eyes and elevated bilirubin levels, suggest a diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome. This is supported by the absence of other abnormalities on laboratory studies, a negative peripheral blood smear, and a history of recent travel and/or medication use that can cause hepatic dysfunction. Rotor syndrome and Dubin-Johnson syndrome are rare inherited conditions that have similar clinical features, but they are less likely given the patient's history and laboratory results. Hepatitis B infection is also less likely given the patient's positive anti-HBs status."

The patient has scleral icterus and elevated bilirubin levels, but liver enzymes are normal, suggesting unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The presence of anti-HAV IgG and anti-HBs antibodies suggests past infection or immunity to hepatitis A and B, making hepatitis B infection less likely. The absence of anemia or abnormal cells on the peripheral blood smear and the lack of symptoms of hemolysis make Rotor syndrome less likely. The absence of an elevated coproporphyrin level rules out Dubin-Johnson syndrome. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Gilbert's syndrome, which is a benign hereditary disorder characterized by intermittent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Primaquine and nitrofurantoin can also cause drug-induced hemolysis, which can exacerbate hyperbilirubinemia in Gilbert's syndrome."
