The sudden loss of vision, pale white retina with a bright red area within the macula, and absent direct pupillary reflex in the right eye are all signs and symptoms of central retinal artery occlusion. The patient's medical history also includes multiple sclerosis, which can increase the risk of vascular occlusive disorders in the eye. Central serous retinopathy would not cause sudden loss of vision, and acute angle-closure glaucoma would present with eye pain and significantly elevated intraocular pressure. Vitreous hemorrhage would cause visual distortion and floaters."

The absence of a direct pupillary reflex in the affected eye suggests a problem with the afferent portion of the reflex arc, which can occur with central retinal artery occlusion. The fundoscopic examination findings of a white, pale retina with a bright red area within the macula and a normal optic disc are also consistent with central retinal artery occlusion. Central serous retinopathy and vitreous hemorrhage would typically present with different symptoms, such as vision distortion or floaters. Acute angle-closure glaucoma would typically present with eye pain and a red eye, and the intraocular pressure measurements in this case are not consistent with that diagnosis."

Central serous retinopathy causes a distortion of vision, not complete loss of vision. Acute angle-closure glaucoma causes eye pain and headaches, which the patient does not report. Vitreous hemorrhage would cause a decrease in vision, but it would not be sudden and complete."

The sudden loss of vision, absence of perception of light in the right eye, and a white, 1-mm ring around the circumference of the cornea in both eyes suggest central retinal artery occlusion. The patient's history of multiple sclerosis and previous episodes of vision loss improving with glucocorticoid treatment may suggest an underlying autoimmune disorder contributing to the occlusion. Acute angle-closure glaucoma would present with eye pain, which is not mentioned in the scenario. Vitreous hemorrhage would present with floaters and decreased visual acuity. Central serous retinopathy would present with distorted or blurred vision, and may be associated with stress or systemic corticosteroid use."
