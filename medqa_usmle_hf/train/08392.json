The patient's missed abortion requiring D&C seven months ago could have caused Asherman syndrome, which is characterized by intrauterine adhesions that prevent menstrual bleeding. The absence of withdrawal bleeding after the progestin challenge test supports this diagnosis. Ectopic pregnancy is unlikely given the negative serum beta-hCG and lack of other symptoms suggestive of an ectopic. Pelvic inflammatory disease is also less likely given the patient's unremarkable physical exam and normal laboratory values. Hypothalamic hypoestrogenism is not supported by the patient\u2019s normal thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin concentrations."
