The question asks which muscle-nerve complex is involved in producing an S1 reflex, and among the options, only the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles are innervated by the tibial nerve, which is responsible for the S1 reflex. This is also supported by the fact that the patient has an absent S1 reflex on the right side due to the compression of the S1 nerve root.
