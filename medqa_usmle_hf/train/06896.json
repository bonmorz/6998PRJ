The given arterial blood gas values indicate metabolic acidosis, possibly caused by valproate withdrawal or another underlying condition. However, the patient is not in respiratory distress and is oxygenating well, so intubation is not necessary. Normal saline can be used to correct dehydration or electrolyte imbalances, but it will not address the acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate may be used to correct the acidosis, but it is not the best initial step. Therefore, the best next step in management would be observation to monitor the patient's condition and determine if further intervention is necessary."

The ABG results show an acidotic pH with low bicarbonate and low PCO2, suggesting respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation. This is likely due to hypoventilation, which may be caused by the seizure episode or medication withdrawal. The patient is still maintaining adequate oxygenation, so intubation is not immediately necessary. Normal saline may be given for hydration, but it will not directly address the acid-base disturbance. Sodium bicarbonate may be considered to correct the acidosis, but it should be used cautiously and may not be necessary if the patient\u2019s symptoms resolve with observation. Therefore, observation is the best next step in management to monitor the patient\u2019s condition and assess the need for intervention."
