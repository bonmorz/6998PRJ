The patient has a clear need for pain management, but his history of opioid use disorder and methadone maintenance treatment warrants caution.

Urine toxicology screening and psychiatric evaluation can be considered, but not as the immediate next step. Administration of buprenorphine may not provide sufficient pain control for the patient's severe pain."
