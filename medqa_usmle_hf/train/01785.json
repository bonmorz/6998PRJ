The pathologic examination shows that the patient has an urothelial carcinoma that has penetrated into the muscular layer. Radical cystectomy, which involves the removal of the bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles in men, and the bladder, uterus, ovaries, and part of the vagina in women, is the most appropriate next step in management. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be used as an adjunct to the surgery. Intravesical chemotherapy is a treatment option for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, but not for invasive bladder cancer. Palliative polychemotherapy may be an option if the patient's cancer is metastatic and cannot be cured."

The patient has a 3-cm mass in the bladder mucosa with penetration into the muscular layer, indicating urothelial carcinoma. This is a potentially aggressive and invasive tumor, so the most appropriate next step in management is radical cystectomy, which involves the removal of the entire bladder and surrounding tissues. Transurethral resection of tumor with intravesical chemotherapy can be used as initial treatment for early-stage bladder cancer, but is not appropriate in this case. Radiation therapy may be used in combination with surgery or as a palliative option, but is not the first-line treatment for invasive bladder cancer. Palliative polychemotherapy may be used in advanced cases, but is not necessary in this case as the cancer has not spread beyond the bladder."
