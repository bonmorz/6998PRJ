Parathyroid adenoma is a cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. Sarcoidosis can cause hypercalcemia by causing the activation of vitamin D without regulation by PTH."

Chronic renal failure leads to decreased activation of vitamin D in the body, resulting in decreased absorption of calcium from the intestines. This, in turn, leads to increased secretion of PTH by the parathyroid glands in order to maintain calcium levels in the blood. Similar mechanisms are seen in end stage liver failure, where there is impaired conversion of vitamin D to its active form. Insufficient Ca intake leads directly to low calcium levels and does not involve the parathyroid gland. Parathyroid adenoma causes a primary hyperparathyroidism and would not be in line with the patient's chronic renal failure. Sarcoidosis can cause hypercalcemia, but not necessarily involving the same mechanism as in chronic renal failure."
