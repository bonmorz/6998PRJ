The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest mild anemia, as seen in the conjunctival pallor, fatigue, and difficulty participating in sports. Increased RDW and TIBC are indicative of iron-deficiency anemia, which is common in children who have increased growth requirements but are not getting enough iron through their diet. Vitamin D deficiency may impair bone growth but is not likely to cause anemia. Decreased IGF levels would be expected in conditions such as growth hormone deficiency, but this is not suggested by the patient\u2019s history or physical exam. Decreased oxygen saturation during sleep may be seen in patients with sleep apnea, but there is no indication of this in the patient\u2019s history or physical exam."

The patient complains of fatigue and trouble participating in sports, and he has conjunctival pallor and a clear middle ear effusion, suggesting anemia. The labs show an elevated RDW and TIBC, which further suggests iron-deficiency anemia. Decreased IGF levels would affect growth and height, but the patient's height is only in the 15th percentile, not extremely low. Decreased vitamin D level would affect bone health, but the patient's Ca2+ level is within the normal range. Decreased oxygen saturation during sleep would suggest sleep apnea, but this is not mentioned in the question stem."
