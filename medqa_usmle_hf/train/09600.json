This suggests that the mass may be non-calcified and therefore missed on mammogram. An ultrasound can reveal the presence of the mass and help determine if it is solid or cystic. Therefore, performing an ultrasound of the left breast is the best next step in management. Options A and B are not appropriate as tamoxifen is used for treatment and repeat mammogram in 6 months may delay diagnosis. Option C is risky as mass may grow significantly in 6 months; biopsy should be done as soon as possible to exclude malignancy."

In this case, performing an ultrasound of the left breast would be the best next step as it would allow better visualization of the mass and potentially guide a biopsy if necessary. Observing for 6 months and biopsy if it persists would be appropriate for a benign-appearing mass, but in this case, the suspicious nature of the mass warrants further investigation. Tamoxifen therapy may be appropriate for certain types of breast cancer, but there is not enough information to suggest that in this case."
