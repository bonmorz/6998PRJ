The FEV1/FVC ratio less than 0.7 indicates obstruction of airflow, suggesting that the other pulmonary function tests will also show obstruction. Therefore, albuterol is not expected to improve FEV1. Methacholine will cause bronchoconstriction and decrease FEV1, so option B can be ruled out. DLCO measures the ability of gas to move from the lungs into the blood, and it is not directly related to obstruction, so option A is also incorrect. Fractional exhalation of nitric oxide is a marker of airway inflammation, which is often present in asthma, but does not directly indicate airflow obstruction. Therefore, option D is the most likely answer."

Option (A) is incorrect because DLCO is usually normal in asthma. Option (B) is incorrect because methacholine induces bronchoconstriction and will decrease the FEV1, which is already decreased in this patient. Option (C) is incorrect because albuterol is a bronchodilator and should increase the FEV1. Option (D) is correct because nitric oxide is produced by the airway epithelium and increased fractional exhalation of nitric oxide is a marker of airway inflammation in asthma."

Option (A) is incorrect as asthma often results in an increased DLCO.
