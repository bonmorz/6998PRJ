The patient's symptoms suggest chronic bronchitis, a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often caused by smoking. Increased goblet cells are a characteristic feature of chronic bronchitis, leading to increased mucus production and cough. Alveolar macrophages may be decreased in smokers, but this is not specific to chronic bronchitis. Ciliated epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells do not have significant changes in chronic bronchitis."
