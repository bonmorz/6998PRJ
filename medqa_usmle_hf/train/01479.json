The patient has symptoms consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis, including increased thirst, weight loss, high glucose, and positive ketones. The blood gas also shows acidosis. The most appropriate next step is intravenous hydration with 0.9% normal saline and insulin, as insulin is needed to lower the high blood glucose and prevent further ketone formation. Potassium may also be added as needed to correct any electrolyte imbalances. Option B, 5% dextrose solution and 0.45% normal saline, would not adequately correct the high glucose and acidosis. Option C, 0.9% normal saline and potassium chloride, may be used if the patient has hypokalemia, but insulin is still needed to correct the underlying problem. Option D, intravenous sodium bicarbonate, may be used if there is severe acidosis, but insulin and hydration remain the primary treatments."
