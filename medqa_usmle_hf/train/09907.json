The description of the mass as having multiple cystic spaces that resembles a bunch of grapes is indicative of a complete hydatidiform mole (CHM), which is an abnormal genetic condition where the fetus fails to develop properly. CHM is characterized by the absence of fetal tissue and the presence of a mass of grapelike cysts that result from the abnormal proliferation of placental tissue. The karyotype of CHM is 46, XX, as there is no contribution of the father's chromosomes to the formation of the mole."

The symptoms and ultrasonogram suggest that the patient has a molar pregnancy, which is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease. In a complete hydatidiform mole, all of the chromosomes are paternal, leading to a karyotype of 46, XX. Option B is incorrect because a male karyotype would indicate a partial mole or a choriocarcinoma, which can also present with vaginal bleeding and an enlarged uterus. Option C is incorrect because a karyotype of 46, YY is not possible. Option D is incorrect because a karyotype of 69, XXY would indicate a Triploidy, which is a rare chromosomal abnormality and is not typically associated with gestational trophoblastic disease."

This type of pregnancy is characterized by the proliferation of trophoblasts, which are the cells that normally help in the attachment of the embryo to the uterus. In a molar pregnancy, the trophoblasts grow abnormally, leading to the formation of cystic spaces that resemble grapes. As a result, the pregnancy does not develop normally, and there is no fetus. The genetic analysis of the atypical tissue is most likely to reveal a 46,XX karyotype. This is because a molar pregnancy usually arises from an egg that does not have any genetic material (either because it did not receive chromosomes from the sperm, or because the chromosomes from both the egg and the sperm duplicated). As a result, all of the genetic material in the molar pregnancy comes from the mother, leading to a 46,XX karyotype."
