The infant's symptoms are consistent with normal hormonal changes that occur in the first few days of life when maternal hormones are still circulating in the infant's body. No tests or interventions are needed, as this generally resolves on its own within a few weeks. Option A is not necessary in this case, as a karyotype is not indicated unless there are other concerns about chromosomal abnormalities. Options B and C are not relevant to the presentation, as they refer to conditions related to adrenal gland dysfunction, which would not present with the same symptoms as this case."
